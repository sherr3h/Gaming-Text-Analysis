2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"This movie was just as great as the original 1967 animated classic! The visual effects & special effects are absolutely astounding! They look exactly like real animals! The voice cast is perfect, the acting from Neel Sethi is dramatic & really good. Shere Khan's performance's were top-notch & ferociously brilliant. My big issues with this film are the songs & the similarities to other disney classics. The songs have no harmony, no energy, & they are not really singing. The sequence's are exceedingly similar to the lion king & tarzan. The plot is barely original but has a little bit more lion king in there, & there's a little bit of tarzan in there too.
Overall, i'm gonna give the live action jungle book 4 out of 5 stars.",2017-08-13T22:00:18.000Z,0

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,i grew up on the original Walt Disney animaton family all time classic and i have seen many remakes. out of the remakes i have 2 and they are the one with young Jamie Williams that was different but a classic and this brand new one also a all time classic. the other remakes was trash made garbage because they  had young Mowgli older than  10 the age he is in the original. as i always believe you cant change any originals. This new one is very good and it has everything that does make a brilliant masterpiece all time classic.and the boy is so much like Mowgli. this new one is for all true fans of the original. no true fans of the original would say this is not good. when i saw the original as a very young boy i seen myself as Mowgli and when i saw it as an adult i seen me as Baloo. this one will go on like the original.,2017-01-24T14:14:43.000Z,0

But there was some issues I had. For one why did they leave in the singing? I mean, I like listening to music and songs but in a movie, its just plain annoying, I mean this movie was a reimagining¬† of the original with more development with characters and great sites, but with a movie s awesome as this, never put in songs cuz then it might dumb it down, with musicals, sure, theres some great lyrics and great voices but for movies like High School Musical or Tangled its just so lame cuz people wanna see the story and not the songs",2016-05-07T12:07:10.000Z,0

i cannot see what the big deal is, and why all you americans are praising it to the roof and every single youtube review guy thinks its the most awesome film ever.

iam sorry to say , it is not that great. i found it lame and boring as if i was watching a tv movie. average at best. 
and the boy who plays mowgli looks like a fuckin girl all throughout the film ! very annoying.

most british people here have the same opinion about the film as me. we can tell the difference between a good film and a bad film. 

what is it with you americans and your fascination with all things dumb, stupid and absurd. you seem to praise and hail all things dumb -  and dont like anything good or normal. first there was george bush, donald trump, jennifer lawrence, and now jungle book.

there are far more awesome films out there than this one. this film is NOT that awesome.

NO SPOILER

1. The opening logo made me tear up a bit. You'll see a bit different Disney logo. I don't know why, but it made me tear. 
2. The visual effects is superb and well-crafted. From the animals to the grand jungle set. A true visual feast that is totally ahead of its time. 99% of the film is CGI.
3. Great voice cast. Love Baloo and Bagheera
4. It has that fairy tale Disney feel
5. Neel Sethi (Mowgli) brought so much charm in the movie. He is captivating. What a great actor he is! 
6. It has Bare Necessities and I Wanna be Like You.
7. Love the musical score
8. End Credits is amazing. Watch out for it. I won't spoil. Disney fans will love it. It's a true tribute to the classic Disney.
9. The movie has a big heart. Perfect family movie.

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"*I think a new word needs to be invented for the English language.* Hear me out curious readers, you'll either educate me, or if I'm lucky you'll agree with me. 

So, what would you call that thing that happens at the end of this trailer where in an ""after credits"" type of scene, they give us a glimpse of Baloo whistling the classic *""Bare Necessities""* song? I'm not asking for you to describe it (i.e. floating on a river, etc), I'm saying, what is that type of moment called? Please, seriously think about it, I'd like to know. Is there a word for it? It's obviously instantly recognizable to us, and if you're like me, you thought, ""omg...they included that song, that's really, really cool!"" 

So what's that called? You might say, ""well, I‚Äôm not quite sure what you‚Äôre asking, and why this Youtube comment is so weird and long, but this is obviously a scene where the they included that classic song,"" or ""they're kind of redoing something from the past."" 
Well, first off, I said ""_word_,"" not a sentence to describe that moment :). The best I can come up with are words like, *""homage,"" ""callback,"" or ""tribute.""* If you wanna stretch it, maybe even ""reference."" The problem with those words are, it doesn't quite have the right connotation. At all. Not even a little bit. *It's completely lifeless and devoid of the actual emotional reaction we get when seeing such scenes.* 

Here's what I mean. It's not as if we would use any of those words and say, *""oh cool, they paid homage to that song,"" or ""haha, nice callback.""* No, in watching that scene, as that tune played, *you probably smiled to yourself, while others who are huge fans may have hunched forward towards their monitors and put their hands to their open mouths, eyes wide with joy and surprise. While even bigger fans may have pushed their feet on the floor to scoot backwards in their office/gaming chairs. Finally, people that saw this in groups, most likely smiled giddily and looked around to silently say, ‚Äúplease tell me you recognized that song!‚Äù*

Whatever the degree of reaction, there's an emotional content there. And again, to describe these moments of *nostalgia*, all we really have is our own emotional reactions for to describe it (just look at the comments that reference the end of this trailer, all of them say something to the effect of, ‚Äúwas that song what I thought it was?‚Äù and ‚Äúwow they included the song.‚Äù). 
There‚Äôs no single word that I know of, and there should be. We have a lot of words to choose from to communicate thoughts and Ideas. To be as granular and precise as we want, to spin our intentions just the way we want, to put the exact, tiniest connotation on an idea to make our points. But not here. They didn‚Äôt think of a word to describe this type of moment, but they‚Äôre going to have to. As more time passes, the more there are more *nostalgic* moments that can be referenced as *easter eggs*.",2016-02-08T16:37:34.000Z,0

Scarlett Johansen absolutely nails the voice, the way she sounds motherly yet creepy. Seductive, as to lead Mowgli into a false sense of security.

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"The only thing that's not as great for me is the snake. I understand that they wanted a female voice for the seductive, luring talking, but perhaps a little too seductive? The best thing about the original Kaa, was that he was goofy, and funny. Where is that now?? She could never be that. It just doesn't fit. It's not the right voice. It should've been a guy's voice. Original Kaa may have been seen as pretty annoying, but dam* funny at the same time. With her, it's just plain annoying. If they wanted to go for a more serious movie with no funnyies, or funny moments, they could've still gave the snake a guy's voice. One that would remind you of the original Kaa's voice, except like 5 times darker, and more creepier. That would've been equally as scary, luring and menacing! It doesn't seem that it would work to me. She could never be Kaa, or at least like the original Kaa. The rest seems like it will really work out great. Even ol' Baloo. :) Miss him having blue fur though. lol   I'm not saying that this movie will be an epic fail. Maybe it could be just epic. :D I had actually just watched The Jungle Book 2, when I first heard about this trailer by the way. :)",2015-11-05T06:33:06.000Z,0

If you're worried that the Disney remake will suck, it might.  But it won't ruin the classic, and if you don't like it, just watch the Warner Bros. version.  If you're worried that the WB version will suck, it might.  Life goes on, we still have the classic Disney version (although I would argue that it's rather subpar for classic Disney) and we still can live with all the Jungle Book movies that we have already.

so why the hell are you making another live action remake of a disney classic?!
Havent you learnt from your mistakes?
Also why did you give it a dark and serious tone, the orginal's bright and happy charm is what made it good! Its like making a horror film out of the smurfs, it just dosent work!
Don't get me wrong, a remake could have worked a bright CGI pixar movie could have probably worked with the right style and charm yet this looks like a failure already.
I can' wait to wach this in the cinemas and laugh uncontrolably at the fucking

I just got sold on this movie. 

Ben Kingsley is Bagheera, which I can see.
Bill Murray is Baloo, which is pretty predictable - but he'll probably do great in the role. 
And Idiris Elba is Shere Kahn, which will be very interesting.

What other Live action feature length Disney film project will there be in the future, DINOTOPIA? Well I herd or should I say I've just discovered this Origin of a DINOTOPIA Film on Wikipedia some time ago & it quotes. Quote: Plans for a DINOTOPIA film were previously rejected due to the expense of creating a world populated by both humans and dinosaurs. Both Columbia Pictures and Disney at one time made the attempt, but both studios abandoned the idea, Disney opting to make their own homegrown film, Dinosaur in 2000. Hallmark Entertainment chief Robert Halmi Sr. then purchased the rights after having seen Gurney's book. Unquote. Well true A miniseries was seen on TV on Disney ABC. Including the continuing series.¬†I just notices Disney is making a live action film The Jungle Book. If they made a Live action Film with Talking animals in that new Disney Film coming to Theaters Next Spring. That's why couldn't make a feature Film with humans & Dinosaurs AKA Talking Dinosaurs on the Big Screen. Based on James Gurney's award winning books. Well if you know Disney see if they can try to make a DINOTOPIA film on the Big Screen as they've originally started & tried years ago. Well good luck contacting Walt Disney Studios. Bye. Oh & one more thing. If there's some new animals in this live action version of Disney's The Jungle Book, Could there be some Crocodiles too? Well in India there are Marsh Crocodiles AKA Mugger Crocodiles, Gharials AKA Gharial Crocodiles¬†& The Largest of All The of all Saltwater Crocodiles AKA Indopacific & Estuarine Crocodiles. As a matter of fact there is a Crocodile character In The Jungle Book Stories & his name is named Jacala. Jacala the Crocodile. I doubt that character is going to be in this live action version of Disney's The Jungle Book.",2015-09-24T00:08:49.000Z,0

Look, I actually liked Malificent because it expounded upon the (admittedly rather boring) Sleeping Beauty story and did something different with it. Maybe it wasn't good, but I personally found it interesting. But Cinderella was just 'oh, it's now live action instead of animated; that makes it worth a watch, right?'

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"To be honest, i was mixed about this until it showed John Favreaus name aka Happy Hogan. The guy who Director Iron Man 1 & 2, executive produce Iron Man 3, The Avengers 1 & 2. I'm clarifying this as a reminder. But still, it doesn't hurt to stay cautious. I hope that he has been given the authority to have full control of the project. Plus i have to give credit for excellent casting. Idris Elba is excellent choice to play Shere Khan and most can agree on the fact bill performance as Baloo will be hopfully WAY BETTER then.......Garfield. I will say it cool to point out that Richard M. Sherman is returning to write the songs for the film. I'm sure the songs are gonna do well and most likely dedicate the songs to his late brother Robert B. Sherman, since they both wrote a long songs together for as long as Richard can remember and misses him every day. Just as Ridley Scott misses his brother Tony Scott everyday as well or for any one else who's lost someone close to them for that matter. Point is, this film is good hands. I will remind everyone that form what i've herd from those who read the book, say it ain't all that bright and colorful from what we've seen form the 1967. Don't get me wrong, i love that movie with a passion. I'm just pointing out when they adapted it, they had to make a few changes, like all many film adaptations do. Even veteran animator Chuck Jones's version counts as well. I should point this out as well. Warner Bros. Pictures is also developing a live-action version of there own titled Jungle Book: Origins, with Steve Kloves writing and Andy Serkis set to direct. Serkis will also be providing the voice of Baloo. Previously, Ron Howard was originally set to helm as director. The film was originally set for release on October 21, 2016, with a title of Jungle Book: Origins. The film will be released a year later on October 6, 2017. Benedict Cumberbatch joined the film to voice the lead role of Shere Khan (Brilliant casting choice since Smaug), Christian Bale as Bagheera (Awesome), Cate Blanchett as Kaa (Nice), Naomie Harris as Raksha (REALY GOOD CHOICE), Tom Hollander as Tabaqui, Eddie Marsan as Papa Wolf, Peter Mullan as Akela, and Rohan Chand as Mowgli also added to the cast. It's funny that two Studios are each doing there take on the story. I like that Kaa in both versions are voiced by amazing actresses. I do appreciate that both films are in good hands. Also, the director was born 1966 and jungle book animated film was the year after. I'm sure he loved that movie, if ever did see it as kid growing up. So that little bit was for any one loved the Animated version. This my is just my opinion guys.",2015-09-21T23:31:40.000Z,0

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"Everything's fine except the thing that The Jungle book old version is far different from this so far according to the trailer because as the old version is mainly aimed towards kids it was had peaceful music and didn't have scenes which gave goosebumps to kids rather made them happy. But this trailer makes it looks like it's aimed towards elderly people, I mean come on if a kid is taken to a theater to watch this film just imagine how scared he would become when Sher Khan jumps out suddenly with Roaring. It looks like the darker version of The Jungle Book unlike the pleasant,peaceful and joyful original one. But it was great! Only if it had a different title.",2015-09-20T16:40:23.000Z,0

I got the bad feeling that he is going to start out as the ""chosen one."" Like he was prophesied to kill the tiger or something.
He will later meet baloo, and he will turn out to be some great martial arts master.
He will then have to face Shere Khan one on one in a fiery ring and there is going to be alot of slow motion. But we won't see who wins. In the end we see mogli return to the woods and stand on some elevated point, like a tree branch or rock in front of all the monkeys who use to bully him in jungle school or something really stupid like that, and he lifts up Khan's head. Then the monkeys... I mean orangutans who will not sound racist, but in fact won't ever actually talk at all, will bow and then they will pick him up and he will crowd surf in a crucifix. Then the end credits scene will show that Khan is not dead and now has a robot body.

I hope I am wrong, but this is what went through my head while watching this. I don't know why it had to be so action packed, it is like a matrix preview or something. I like Jon Favreau, so I'll just chalk this up to bad choices made in advertising.",2015-09-18T10:20:27.000Z,1

Scarlett is amazing in any sinister role, but I felt like this was especially fitting. I loved how comforting her voice was at first - how motherly it sounded... as if she was truly deeply concerned for Mowgli's well-being. Because I didn't expect the gender switch and couldn't immediately identify which character the voice belonged to, I found myself trusting the voice as well. I didn't even realize how menacing the undertone of her words were until I started recognizing the prolonged pronunciation of the S's and figured out it was Kaa. I think that embodies Kaa perfectly - hypnotically alluring and appearing trustful to the point where you can't tell they're tricking you before it's far too late.",2015-09-18T03:08:01.000Z,1

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"t Heaven or hell? Make that decision today, you're not promised tomorrow.
According to the Word of God, there is not a righteous person on earth (Romans 3:10) Because all have sinned and come short of the glory of God(Romans 3:23). Here's how a holy God defines evil: Whoever hates his brother is a murderer (1 John 3:15). Ever hated anyone? Ever told a lie?The Word of God states that "" All liars will have their part in the lake of fire "". In Revelation 21:8. Ever looked at someone with lust? Jesus said looking with lust is committing adultery in your heart (Matt. 5:28). Ever stolen anything? No thief and adulterer will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9,10).Because God is holy, He must punish all who sin, and His place of punishment is hell for all eternity.So you see, we've all done these things, we all deserve hell.And If you've done even one of these things, and have not repented and believed on Jesus, you currently are on your way to hell.God's standard of goodness is perfection,in thought, word, and deed so none of us can ever make it to heaven on our own. We are sinful, and even one sin will keep us from heaven. But In His great love and mercy, God provided a way for us to be forgiven of our sins and saved from that punishment. Through the Savior, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross to pay the penalty for your sins. I am sure you have heard of John 3:16? It's the most famous verse in the Bible, it reads "" For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life ."" If you believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died on the cross for your sins, and resurrected from the dead, you will be forgiven of all your sins and saved from hell.(Acts 13:38, Acts 16:30,31)",2015-09-17T22:19:35.000Z,1

And take a glance at the fancy ants
Then maybe try a few

And you prick a raw paw
Next time beware
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw
When you pick a pear
Try to use the claw
But you don't need to use the claw
When you pick a pear of the big paw-paw
Have I given you a clue ?

So just try and relax, yeah cool it
Fall apart in my backyard
'Cause let me tell you something little britches

You're working too hard

And don't spend your time lookin' around
For something you want that can't be found

Yes, it's a tool, and can definitely be used in wrong ways - but then again, same thing can be applied to practical effects. But when CGI is done right, and even pushes the envelope it can do wonders.

Feel how you want, but I think that these claims against CGI are arguably disrespectful to the dedicated VFX artists out there and downgrades their work. That's quite unfortunate to me as we've seen that the technology, particularly through Motion Capture has pushed technology to new levels of innovation for filmmaking.",2015-09-17T14:19:26.000Z,1

The story is set in Central India which is a sandstone outcrop with tropical dry deciduous and some tropical evergreen forests. Cinematic liberties do not mean taking the audience to be so naive. The story of Mowgli is one of my favourites, I hope Disney won't spoil it further. The central part of the original book is universal compassion beyond different species itself. Therefore, the authenticity of animal life is crucial to help make the story feel real. Still, I eagerly await the film.",2015-09-17T12:41:13.000Z,0

Never was a big fun of Jungle Book, even though I must have watched it a billion times. That being said, I am really stoked for this movie! No idea why, maybe it's just the well thought out trailer, or my curiosity wondering how this movie will be in ""Live Action.""

If this goes well, I would really love to see a Lion King movie made. All time favorite Disney always will be. Don't know how they would make it work, or why would they ever remake the movie..Maybe just my curiosity kicking in again but I can't help imagine how epic a CGI Live Action fight between Simba and Scar would be! I mean come on, it would be worth it just for that scene! So I am hoping!

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"DAMN!!!!! 

When I first saw the thumbnail for this trailer I immediately thought to myself:  Oh, shit. Here we go again. Has Disney just given up? ANOTHER FUCKIN' REMAKE?! SERIOUSLY?

I was all set to hate this movie.

But in full honesty after seeing the trailer, I have to admit it does look like a damn good movie. I just hope it delivers because to be honest after the huge let down brought on by ""Maleficent"" I really hope this movie is done as well as it's played up.

I'm just curious to see from what angle they hit this movie. 

Alice in Wonderland: Prophesy/ Chosen One
Oz the Great and Powerful: Prophesy/ Chosen One, villain turns evil because man cheats on her
Maleficent: Villain turns evil because man cheats on her, redemption

Those movies were all recycled plots that we've already seen a million times. (I haven't seen Cinderella) So I really hope Disney brings something new this time around.",2015-09-16T17:13:51.000Z,1

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"I'll be one of the first to say I'm not a huge fan of all these Disney live-action remakes (not saying they're bad movies, just unnecessary ones).
I'll also be the first to say I truly wondered how they were going to cast parts for these (at least for me and my childhood) iconic voices. 
Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, and George Sanders all completely owned those roles, and I have very, VERY fond memories of the original Disney film. 
So, naturally, I was concerned when I heard not one but TWO new Jungle Book films were announced, one of which was being made by Disney. 
After seeing the trailer, my action could be boiled down to this: Scarlett. Johansson. 
Kaa was tied for my absolute favorite character in the original, and Sterling Holloway played the part to perfection. I'll admit I was more than a little worried when I heard that Scarlett would be voicing the sneaky snake. 
She completely and utterly put all that doubt to rest the second I pieced together that it was Kaa doing the trailer voiceover. It just disappeared, vanished. She isn't Sterling Holloway, but neither is Holloway Scarlett Johansson. Both of them bring something very different but equally incredible to the role, and after hearing the obvious love and care Scarlett put into just the few lines heard here, I'm starting to think that this movie just might be the live-action Disney movie that softens me a little on the whole idea. 
And having Idris Elba doesn't hurt either. That guy could have voiced the one of the trees and I'd still want to hear it. But freaking Shere Khan? 
The casting is incredible, the overall look of the film looks promising. I dunno guys. Did Disney do something right this time?",2015-09-16T16:32:49.000Z,0

I read all the Nancy Drew books and the movie doesn't hold a candle to what those books are, those stories were quite terrifying in some of the books. Getting back to the Jungle Book. Mowgli was friends with the animals, not out to hurt him (in the book and the original film), maybe a few ""sneaky"" characters, there is always 1 villian in any Disney story.

- They made King Louie a Gigantopithecus ( an extinct ape species ) rather than an Orangutans (which don't exist in India) but he shouldn't be the size of King Kong !
- They made Balooo a grizzly bear, which is ridiculous, because they don't exist in India
- They made Kaa into a female unlike the original, her CGI looks so bad.
- Sher Khan looks like a Siberian Tiger instead of a Bengal Tiger.

I like the deeper, darker, scarier take of the jungle book for the teaser however I hope it maintains its original happy vibrant vibe for the film. The last whistle scene gives me some hope.",2015-09-16T14:24:49.000Z,1

At least this one is different from the animated version or other live versions based on Rudyard Kipling. I hope this one will be the Disney's live action classic and of course, Cinderella did it well to make it perfect.

The next year will be good and I'm hoping see it. By the way, do the bear whistkes for ""The Bear Nescesties?"" That's odd.",2015-09-16T13:52:48.000Z,1

planet of the apes gave each monkey a distinct look, now here it's just all lifelike as possible. i'm not digging kaa at all....
and i was very scared as a kid. but the way it talks is just.embarassing i think. 
should have gone smaug all the way.

I'm sceptical on Bill Murray as Baloo though, just doesn't seem like it'll work (Still, Haven't seen enough yet).

People think that just because it was made with a computer, that all that's required is just a couple clicks of a mouse, and a few key strokes, and voila! CGI! They think it's less artistic. But most of those people don't realize how much artistic talent  goes into creating great CGI. Everyone working on a CGI movie is an artist, especially when it comes to actually designing characters and creating CGI models, creating the textures; coloring, and lighting them and then animating them! All done by artists! 

Sure they could use animatronics and fake stuffed animals, but then you'd be complaining how fake and cheap that looked, when the guy is wresting and rolling around on the ground with a stuffed tiger. And face it animatronics look like... well... animatronics! 

So get over it already! CGI is not only a tool, it's an art form, and it's here to stay!

Also a lot of people here in the comments are comparing this to Disney's animated Jungle Book. There was also two other live action Jungle Book movies of any real mention! The first live action version was the 1942 Jungle Book, which starred the great Indian actor Sabu, and the other was the 1994 version, which starred Jason Scott Lee. Neither of which were musicals, or had the song ""bare necessities,"" in them and they were still good movies (for their time!) And as far as I remember, neither of them had any CGI in them, certainly not the 1942 version. Though it's possible they used CGI for the snake in the 1994 version, I don't really remember if they did or not.",2015-09-15T19:32:35.000Z,1

With Cinderella all bright and colourful, this film looks like its going in the opposite direction and I think its really exciting to see hows its going to contrast with the other live action films. Sure Maleficent was meant to be a dark adaptation of Sleeping Beauty but I think that this looks so much darker (which is exactly what I wanted). I felt that Maleficent just wasn't dark enough. I love how the music is haunting  and then you hear Kaa say ""Trust in me"". Really Creepy.

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"Urgh...What the fuck is this?
What is disney's obsession with remaking their older films into everything they SHOULDN'T be?
making the Threatening and terrifying Maleficent into a a generic 'woman scorned' story.
making Cinderella into even MORE of a spectator in a story where she wasn't particularly active to begin with.
and now, making the subdued atmospheric, calm Jungle Book into a generic epic of CGI horseshit.  
I'm sorry, but this looks fucking terrible, no amount of overly epic music and CGI overlayers can change that.",2015-09-15T17:49:27.000Z,226
