Why? Don't get me wrong, I'm all for righting injustices, but without knowing of specific injustice done to the family by the contract, it seems puzzling to assume that simply being related to a genius entitles family to a cut of their creation. If Disney fast talked them out of a share they deserve, that's one thing, but if they signed a contract without any real thought to this result, isn't that on their heads?",2011-10-18T05:44:58.000Z,23

I have been a Winnie-the-Pooh lover since the first time I read the books, so many years ago.
I have since seen pooh highjacked as a cutesy bear by valentines manufacturers, wallpaper salesman, and then even disney. 
Seems that this movie is trying, rather than capitalizing on the sucess of Pooh, to interpret the original book and its atmosphere for a new generation.

One thing I would suggest to Disney though: Change the North American release date. Sure you got ""Cars 2"" in June, but having it combat against the final Harry Potter and ""Captain America"" the following week is a faliure-abound idea. I'd suggest to either push it a week up alongside ""Zookeeper"", have it released in Spring (along with it's international dates), or move it to August where it's certain to get larger audiences.",2010-11-11T20:07:44.000Z,0
