Zangief, Ryu, Ken and M. Bison, with the period, are from Street Fighter. That ghost is Clyde from Pac-Man, who also appears with Inky, Blinky, Pinky and Pac-Man. Eggman and Sonic are both from Sonic the Hedgehog. There's also Kano and Smoke from Mortal Kombat, a Zombie from the House of the Dead, the cast of Q-Bert, and Dig-Dug, just to name a few. The company is Disney, and it should have epicness.

Everything about it was amazing including the Disney short before the film started. John C. Reilly was hilarious and Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman were the perfect voices for their characters. And the facial expressions of Vanellope matched Sarah's voice perfectly. My heart melted for Sarah Silverman and this movie had me on the brink of tears for about the last 30 minutes. ,2012-11-05T06:53:16.000Z,0
