Mostly because of Steven T Seagle, Duncan Rouleau and <shutter..> Joe Quesada's influence in the writing and design department.
 Producing bad Marvel TV spinoffs that force comic icons like spiderman and the Avengers into being more PC, Following some virtual meme like live streaming, Mismatching character and plot devices from the comics onto the show that make less sense and are shoehorned ads for ether the movies or the comics from 3-5 years ago, and just not putting in any real-life contrast in the human factor of the heroes' identity.
 Add the heavy Disney lobbyist backed advertising portfolio and the retcons of Spiderman: One more day, and you get a big brightly colored billboard with Quesada's swollen head saying ""I ruined the Marvel fan-base, But Disney says that's Okay!.""
 Oh! that Marvel crossover with Phineas and Ferb was the worst TV special  ever in all existence and everyone involved should shoot themselves in the foot. ",2014-07-16 06:07:43,0,0.1036306141774892,0.45029761904761906
