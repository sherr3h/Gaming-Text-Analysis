What is it with people and hating Anthropomorphic animals?
Hey geniuses, not all furries draw or enjoy porn.
Furries are not all about porn, and if you think that, I highly recommend checking out a webcomic called ""Zoophobia"".
I actually think this is a pretty funny concept. Besides, we have cartoons like Mikey Mouse, Looney Tunes and MANY others, where animals are Anthropomorphic. They don't have anything to do with Furry porn.Â 
Seriously, having Animals as main characters has been around forever and I really like that idea.
Besides, EVERYTHING has porn. Everything. So shut the hell up.

Anyways, for some reason, I just can't get enough of this trailer, I find myself coming back to it time and time again.
The animation is very smooth and the expressions are pretty nice and the concept of the trailer is hilarious, especially with the narrator expressing little to no emotion, and I like the fact that natural enemies don't get along.
I also like how they walk differently, similar to how animals walk differently.

Though Zoophobia is a cool comic and I check up on it weekly myself, I doubt a percentage of people working on this film has ever came across this comic and just figured up a title for the film sort like the author to the comic did. One placed phobia cause the main character is scared of said animals. The other Topia because its a city full of anthros.Â

After a mighty battle with his enemy and a daring rescue of a little girl from radioactive doom, our yet unnamed hero returns to his home, exhausted and a mess...ew...radioactive sweaty super-underwear...atleast it's the outer pair for over his pants. ANYWAY. He casually tosses his dirty clothes in the hamper despite his wife yelling from downstairs to remember his costume goes in the special bin not the regular hamper, and he tiredly staggers off to take a shower. Welllll....when he steps out and goes to find some clean clothes for the evening, the hamper is missing. His wife screams from down stairs and as he rushes awkwardly down the stairs in his towel, he discovers a now LIVING clothes hamper monster trying to eat his wife's oven mit while she tries to wrestle the mit back. The creature panics and escapes, and soon reports of a wandering laundry monster stealing and eatting people's socks pop up all over the neighborhood. People from all walks and groups try to stop the beast, but it keep escaping. A lazy little boy discovers the hamper monster in his backyard, and finds out if he feeds the monster his dirty clothes...he doesn't have to wash them. Ever. So he decides to try and hide it and keep it as a pet, to make cleaning his room easier. Adventure, childhood pet keeping love, drama, and a few tense scenes ensue and in a dramatic battle between the hero hubby in deep doo doo and the hamper monster who mistakenly thinks he has to defend or protect the boy from the hero...the hamper breaks. All smelly missing laundry appears in a massive pile from seemingly out of no where in the middle of the road where the hamper now lay ordinary, plastic, and broken in half. The boy begins to weep. Falling to his knees and bawling, something stirs in the mountain of lost dirty clothes...a pile of baby hamper beasts no bigger than decks of cards leap up and scatter off away. People shriek but the boy is over joyed. These tiny hamper monsters move into homes all acrossed the globe, hiding behind clothes dryers and feasting on the left socks of the world.",2015-06-13 02:09:44,0,-0.1351657329598506,0.48410184586655175

- Right off the bat:Â  Humans *are* animals.Â  You can try and separate them all you want, but humans belong to same Kingdom Animalia as every other mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and invertebrate.Â  Would have been better to say, ""This is not a human."" instead of ""This is an animal.""
- Anthropomorphised means ""human-like"" in every meaning of the word... not just ""it basically walks on two legs"".Â  If that were the case, then every animal that already walks on two legs is ""anthropomorphic"" when they plainly aren't.
- Foxes have hearing far superior to rabbits.
- Crotch-cover when mentioning clothes.Â  Nothing to see in the first place.Â  That old schtick is getting tired.Â  Not to mention, most furred animals have no need for clothes.
- Technology use:Â  Not limited to humans.Â  Many animals use tools, via trial and error, a very basic version of ""the scientific method"".Â 
- Ignoring the pun:Â  Something we haven't seen before... with everything you've mentioned is in this movie?Â  Ignoring, what, the dozens if not hundreds of animated features from around the world, Disney included, that feature nothing but anthropomorphic animals wearing clothes and doing human-like activities in natural conflict between their relative species?Â  I don't think so.
- Be-fur.Â  Puns.Â  No.Â  Puns are bad.Â  Especially puns that end in ""fur"".

Okay what's the plot? What's the conflict? Who's the protagonist? We get nothing from this. It's pretty much banking on furries to go see it. I don't care if you're into that. It's your life, do whatever. But for the rest of us, this should be a pass.",2015-06-13 00:16:58,0,0.2875,0.475
2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"I'll jump on the bandwagon too because I love when people bash furries like me...

This movie is actually pretty adorable. The fox alone has so much expression with just his ears. His shoulders, hands, tail, hips, all scream his emotions with out him having to say a word or even grumble! Animation has come so far and I'm actually kinda excited to see what the story of this movie will be. If there even is a story. It could just be, ""Let's follow a fox through his life in Zootopia.""

Of course, as this is an animated movie with anthropomorphic animals in it, it will attract a huge amount of attention from Furries. We're fans of this schit, what do you expect? Some people will find an erotic niche, some will find a duplication(because replication is a sign of appreciation) niche, and others will enjoy or hate the film for their own reasons.

Some extreme furries might come in with their furry gear and get their furry all over the theater, others might come as generic moviegoers secretly stroking their affinity for anthros. And another chunk of people /will/ be generic movie goers, come to see what the movie has to offer.

News networks, mainly Fox News, will be more than delighted to jump on the ""Let's rip open Furries for being different in a slightly extreme way."" bandwagon and happily rip Furries a new one... Again. Coming up with the obvious, ""Furries have been caught /masturbating/ to the film Zootopia in the theaters... Can you believe it? A bunch of grown men and women in animal costumes are coming to theaters, in public, sitting down and masturbating in front of other people with each other.""

This movie is going to attract a certain kind of people because it meets a certain kind of people's attractions and affinities. It will attract a smaller kind of people as it meets their creative desires and an even smaller amount of people as it meets their creative and sexual needs to replicate and to twist into a sexual light. Its almost guaranteed to make at least some kind of news as it will be very controversial because of the Furry following.

In other words... If you want to watch the movie but you fall ill by the very idea of people enjoying animals so much that they themselves would dress in animals as a way of replicating and appreciating, then sit at home for a month of two. Wait for the movie to come out on DVD or get published all over the internet. it'll be about the same cost or even free. And you can avoid being made ill. Win win if you ask me.

Oh, and yes, more Furries need to learn to take one for the team and mock themselves. If the mockery reaches Furry to Furry levels then it'll become one giant circle jerk and eventually all the mean spirited comments like, ""Furries are the scum of the Earth"" will cease to have really any meaning. It will eventually fight Po's law of shit being done so much as a parody that when things are meant to be a real attempt they won't be seen as real, they'll be seen as more parody.

The only thing that bothers me about these kinds of 'worlds' is what do the animals eat??? If they eat each other is it considered a form of cannibalism or murder?? Or are they all vegetarians?? Or are they SEMI-VEGETARIANS (which would mean chickens and fish aren't inclusive of being 'sentient' anthro animals)?

First, this isn't a ""furry"" movie; that would be like saying Cat's Don't Dance, Robin Hood, Tail Spin,Â etc are ""furry"" movies/shows. Furries areÂ a certain type ofÂ fan, not the name of the concept of anthropomorphic societies.Â Now,Â I certainly don'tÂ have a problem with the furry fandomÂ or with themÂ anticipating this movie (I'm not wishing death on them like some of you homicidal people down there).


Â Second, the idea of anÂ animal only society has existed for aÂ *long* time in movies and children's tales and is not an original concept. Now this doesn't mean Disney can't use this concept as someÂ actually seem toÂ believe; it's certainly not a copyrighted idea. Disney used to use this a lot in the past with it's cartoons so you are being silly acting like because Chicken Little exists means that this movie will be just like it.

I, personally, like the movie, because it looks funny. Especially the goat joke at the end. And this is coming from a guy who is a HUGE furry, and that isn't even a reason I care to see this!

I feel sorry for her. Since Disney is an empire in animation and motion picture industry, she can't do anything about it. I would feel terribly awful too if someone bigger and more well-known than me came along, took my idea, bent it a little and said ""Hey! Look at this completely original movie I just made up myself!"", while I sat in the corner with a comic I've been working on for 8 years, carefully and wholeheartedly devoting myself to, and I could do nothing to change it.

You don't have to be a child to find anthropomorphic animals to be funny or cute. Most of use grew up with anthropomorphic animals that we watched.
Liking anthropomorphic animals, finding them cute or funny doesn't make you a furry. Even if you are, there's nothing wrong with that and people need to stop finding films like these as an excuse to bash a harmless community.
This is also DISNEY. Much of what they have done involves anthropomorphic animals. Why should this surprise anyone?

Disney, YOU have used anthropomorphic creatures in almost all of your movies. This concept itself, of a world made of entirely anthropomorphic animals, is also /not/ an original idea, which you seem to be attempting to pass it off as. There's this thing called the ""furry community"" (an actually great crowd full of good people that has an unfortunate and unjustified reputation). I'm not complaining, stories/worlds like this are great! And the furry community could definitely use some positive exposure. I just feel like it's kind of a kick in the leg to the countless people who have made stories and graphic novels like this when you say it's ""like nothing seen before."" Other than that little line, this seems amazing, and I'm pretty excited for it!

Yes, I get involved in the NSFW art side of the fandom which most people seem to think furries are in general, but i'll tell you now, I have no sexual attraction to said anthro animals and will not be making any pornographic content of these animals (though I may make some cute figurines of that bunny and fox, they're so darn cute, I must squee.) My NSFW is purely of my own OC, whose body is drawn in reference to my own, since she's literally ""a furry persona"". Similar to if someone draws a cartoon or anime version of themselves. I can't vouch for other furries, but I love this movie and it won't be used pornographically by me. But I will go see it, and squee over how cute the characters are, and enjoy the Disney humour, regardless of the fact that i'll be 18 when this movie is released. So yeah, furries liking this isn't really a threat to your kid's safety or anything. It's a cute disney movie, enjoy it guys <3 (No seriously, if you don't enjoy Disney then there's something wrong and you need to see a doctor right away as you may have brain parasites, that or you're just really boring and need to stay far away from me.)",2015-06-12 04:50:07,0,0.2533643892339545,0.7222049689440995

(excluding the furry community) Here's a short list of shows and movies that have already done this decades before this film: Swat Kats, Chicken Little, Tale Spin, Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, The Paw Paws, Thundercats, Babar, Samurai Pizza Cats, Fantomcat, Disneys Robin Hood. But the one thing that Zootopia does different, seems to be the only movie of it's kind to focus a lot on the fact that there are no humans. They're trying to make it seem like They're unique for being aware of this. As if Disney is doing something new, groundbreaking and unheard of.

The only twist here it seems is that humans are animals.

And OH BOY WAS IT!Â  Big Hero 6 was in a sense the ONLY movie that could follow Frozen and Tangled. I really loved the studio for stepping way outside the lines. But this just looks like Robin Hood with sarcasm. Whose idea was this?

Mine was about humans nearly going extinct from a major plague so the leading scientists of the world saved two of each animal (like Noah's Arc) and gave them human intelligence so that when mankind was gone, their legacy would still live on earth. In the future, the animals evolved from the experiments and became anthro, wore clothes and built civilizations (except unlike Zootopia's animals, they're against technology) but they still have the same flaws that humans had: They separate themselves by species and fight with each other. There is one area in the middle of all the nations however that welcome all species and that's where my series takes place.",2015-06-12 00:02:22,2,-0.04472402597402598,0.37678571428571433

Rabbit girl want to be acknowledge for her police skill or is stuck with traffic duty but want to prove herself to be a good cop. She some how witness a crime and cant do it alone and try to get help for the cops that do heavier police work but they don't listen or they go out and find nothing a few times and gave up listening to her. She comes across a fox who could be a eye witness the this crime or have some role or have information on the crime. But also notice that he had a warrant for his arrest or she witness a criminal act that he had done (mostly scamming someone) and blackmailed him to help her to find the criminals and bring them in. As they search for clues they fought along the way but later gain respect for each other (maybe after they tell there personal stories) as they closed in they end she wanted to do everything herself but the fox suggested to calling backup. But after going in and trying to take down the bad guys they end up failing and getting captured and out of some reason the hideout gets destroyed and altered the other cops just to find the two and she end up losing her job and (if the fox had a warrant) he would be put into prison. After sometime in depression after losing her job she encourage herself out of some reason and brakes the fox out of jail (of he encourage her to try again out of some reason). and goes out and try again and succeed (the evil boos might be killed or arrested) and then ends up getting her job back.
The fox might join the force, walk of into the sunset, or ends up in some relationship with her if they go the romance way.

As for the characters I know the fox and bunny is the main but mostly the fox. As for support characters, I think there is gonna be a kinda of a sidekick for the fox maybe a weasel that helps him with some black-market goods or information. And I'm guessing there might be some connection with him in the movie villain and yes I know there is one, theirs always one. I'm not sure what he is gonna be, as for the cops, many top of the food chain and large and strong animals and I'm guessing the commissioner maybe a Lion. And I'm guessing there might be a scene she heads to her parents house and her mom and dad thought she brought home a boyfriend and she could be living with them to

As for personality goes, the Fox is a scammer with a smooth talk to talk his way out of anything. a smartas* but short sighted. The bunny is cleaver, mommas girl or daddy's girl or both,... ok that's all I can think up on.

Post what you think is gonna happen and there personality's",2015-06-11 19:31:21,0,0.038797313797313805,0.38614163614163616
