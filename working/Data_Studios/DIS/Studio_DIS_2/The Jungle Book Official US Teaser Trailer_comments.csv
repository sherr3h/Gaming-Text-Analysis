Yes, it's a tool, and can definitely be used in wrong ways - but then again, same thing can be applied to practical effects. But when CGI is done right, and even pushes the envelope it can do wonders.

Feel how you want, but I think that these claims against CGI are arguably disrespectful to the dedicated VFX artists out there and downgrades their work.

The story is set in Central India which is a sandstone outcrop with tropical dry deciduous and some tropical evergreen forests. Cinematic liberties do not mean taking the audience to be so naive. The story of Mowgli is one of my favourites, I hope Disney won't spoil it further. The central part of the original book is universal compassion beyond different species itself. Therefore, the authenticity of animal life is crucial to help make the story feel real. Still, I eagerly await the film.",2015-09-17 12:41:13,0,0.005257936507936512,0.5710714285714287

Never was a big fun of Jungle Book, even though I must have watched it a billion times. That being said, I am really stoked for this movie! No idea why, maybe it's just the well thought out trailer, or my curiosity wondering how this movie will be in ""Live Action.""

If this goes well, I would really love to see a Lion King movie made. All time favorite Disney always will be. Don't know how they would make it work, or why would they ever remake the movie..Maybe just my curiosity kicking in again but I can't help imagine how epic a CGI Live Action fight between Simba and Scar would be! I mean come on, it would be worth it just for that scene! So I am hoping!

When I first saw the thumbnail for this trailer I immediately thought to myself:  Oh, shit. Here we go again. Has Disney just given up? ANOTHER FUCKIN' REMAKE?! SERIOUSLY?

I was all set to hate this movie.

But in full honesty after seeing the trailer, I have to admit it does look like a damn good movie. I just hope it delivers because to be honest after the huge let down brought on by ""Maleficent"" I really hope this movie is done as well as it's played up.

I'm just curious to see from what angle they hit this movie. 

Alice in Wonderland: Prophesy/ Chosen One
Oz the Great and Powerful: Prophesy/ Chosen One, villain turns evil because man cheats on her
Maleficent: Villain turns evil because man cheats on her, redemption

Those movies were all recycled plots that we've already seen a million times. (I haven't seen Cinderella) So I really hope Disney brings something new this time around.",2015-09-16 17:13:51,1,0.01749851455733811,0.6790255496137849

2015-09-15T16:00:03.000Z,HcgJRQWxKnw,The Jungle Book Official US Teaser Trailer,"I'll be one of the first to say I'm not a huge fan of all these Disney live-action remakes (not saying they're bad movies, just unnecessary ones).
I'll also be the first to say I truly wondered how they were going to cast parts for these (at least for me and my childhood) iconic voices. 
Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, and George Sanders all completely owned those roles, and I have very, VERY fond memories of the original Disney film. 
So, naturally, I was concerned when I heard not one but TWO new Jungle Book films were announced, one of which was being made by Disney. 
After seeing the trailer, my action could be boiled down to this: Scarlett. Johansson. 
Kaa was tied for my absolute favorite character in the original, and Sterling Holloway played the part to perfection. I'll admit I was more than a little worried when I heard that Scarlett would be voicing the sneaky snake. 
She completely and utterly put all that doubt to rest the second I pieced together that it was Kaa doing the trailer voiceover. It just disappeared, vanished. She isn't Sterling Holloway, but neither is Holloway Scarlett Johansson. Both of them bring something very different but equally incredible to the role, and after hearing the obvious love and care Scarlett put into just the few lines heard here, I'm starting to think that this movie just might be the live-action Disney movie that softens me a little on the whole idea. 
And having Idris Elba doesn't hurt either. That guy could have voiced the one of the trees and I'd still want to hear it. But freaking Shere Khan? 
The casting is incredible, the overall look of the film looks promising. I dunno guys. Did Disney do something right this time?",2015-09-16 16:32:49,0,0.1294565401918343,0.5200729988965282

- They made King Louie a Gigantopithecus ( an extinct ape species ) rather than an Orangutans (which don't exist in India) but he shouldn't be the size of King Kong !
- They made Balooo a grizzly bear, which is ridiculous, because they don't exist in India
- They made Kaa into a female unlike the original, her CGI looks so bad.
- Sher Khan looks like a Siberian Tiger instead of a Bengal Tiger.

I like the deeper, darker, scarier take of the jungle book for the teaser however I hope it maintains its original happy vibrant vibe for the film. The last whistle scene gives me some hope.",2015-09-16 14:24:49,1,-0.0016666666666666247,0.5433333333333332

I'm sceptical on Bill Murray as Baloo though, just doesn't seem like it'll work (Still, Haven't seen enough yet).

People think that just because it was made with a computer, that all that's required is just a couple clicks of a mouse, and a few key strokes, and voila! CGI! They think it's less artistic. But most of those people don't realize how much artistic talent  goes into creating great CGI. Everyone working on a CGI movie is an artist, especially when it comes to actually designing characters and creating CGI models, creating the textures; coloring, and lighting them and then animating them! All done by artists! 

Sure they could use animatronics and fake stuffed animals, but then you'd be complaining how fake and cheap that looked, when the guy is wresting and rolling around on the ground with a stuffed tiger. And face it animatronics look like... well... animatronics! 

So get over it already! CGI is not only a tool, it's an art form, and it's here to stay!

Also a lot of people here in the comments are comparing this to Disney's animated Jungle Book. There was also two other live action Jungle Book movies of any real mention! The first live action version was the 1942 Jungle Book, which starred the great Indian actor Sabu, and the other was the 1994 version, which starred Jason Scott Lee. Neither of which were musicals, or had the song ""bare necessities,"" in them and they were still good movies (for their time!) And as far as I remember, neither of them had any CGI in them, certainly not the 1942 version. Though it's possible they used CGI for the snake in the 1994 version, I don't really remember if they did or not.",2015-09-15 19:32:35,1,0.15290934555640437,0.589028944911298

Sure Maleficent was meant to be a dark adaptation of Sleeping Beauty but I think that this looks so much darker (which is exactly what I wanted). I felt that Maleficent just wasn't dark enough. I love how the music is haunting  and then you hear Kaa say ""Trust in me"". Really Creepy.

What is disney's obsession with remaking their older films into everything they SHOULDN'T be?
making the Threatening and terrifying Maleficent into a a generic 'woman scorned' story.
making Cinderella into even MORE of a spectator in a story where she wasn't particularly active to begin with.
and now, making the subdued atmospheric, calm Jungle Book into a generic epic of CGI horseshit.  
I'm sorry, but this looks fucking terrible, no amount of overly epic music and CGI overlayers can change that.",2015-09-15 17:49:27,226,-0.14358974358974358,0.5064102564102565
