I think it's so cool how they show the differences between how children and adults manage their emotions. As you get older, it can get easier to manage your emotions because you'll be more in tune with yourself and just what you're feeling. Dealing with things in a calm, rational manner is something that can unify differing emotions. That's why they look the same in the mom and dad's heads, but not the girl's. In adolescents, like Riley, there's more of a divide between differing emotions. Also, in this movie, I really like that they show that people can sometimes be primarily motivated by a certain emotion. The dad responds with anger while the mom responds with sympathy. It's not that they only feel sadness or anger, it's just that everybody has a certain emotion that can trigger a more effective response in a ""fight or flight"" situation.",2014-12-12 08:51:50,2,0.19695767195767197,0.5056216931216932
