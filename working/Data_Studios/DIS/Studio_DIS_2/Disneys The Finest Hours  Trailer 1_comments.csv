Parts of the film were filmed on location in MA, Chatham, Cohasset, Brant Rock, and in the one of the main warehouses at the old General Dynamics Shipyard in Quincy MA. That's were the close-up water scenes were filmed in a giant wave pool they built in ground. Would love to see the premiere of the movie here in MA.
