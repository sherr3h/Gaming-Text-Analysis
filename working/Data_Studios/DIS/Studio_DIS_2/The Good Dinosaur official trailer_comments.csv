I mean seriously cavemen I mean really this sucks, I thought that they knew that cavemen and dinosaurs existed MILLIONS of years separate from each other and two more things.

1. What Ceratopsian is that at 1:04 I mean really I've seen crazy ceratopsians before like Styracosaurus and Diabloceratops but that no!

2. The Pteranodons HAD TEETH!!! come on IT'S IN THE NAME PteraNOdon
NO DON translating in to NO TEETH!!! And if they call them ""pterodactyls"" I am going to get really upset.

I love dinosaurs, I love all 4 jurassic park movies despite their faults but this takes it too far, unless you make some drastic changes to this movie I will not see it.

I honestly do NOT care about the design of the main dinosaur, it's fine it's a cartoon but the rest SUCKS!!! INCLUDING THE NAME OF THE MOVIE!!!

Man I got mad but I don't hate pixar I JUST HATE THIS MOVIE.

Edit: I read the description AND IT ONLY MAKES IT WORSE if dinosaurs didn't become extinct mammals would not have become the dominant class on the planet thus they would not have become humans I mean Primates didn't even exist until 56 million years ago 8-9 million years away from the extinction of the dinosaurs and evolution works to help creatures adapt to environments so the odds of it being the same evolutionary path as without the dinosaurs is... well IT would not be the same humans (if they were to exist) would look so different that they would not be recognisable!!! 


Oh my god that was LONG and I know this is just a kids movie but man is it brainless you may be able to watch this just fine but I know I would not be able to watch this without correcting everything, (that's probably something wrong with me.) but I don't know all I can suggest is do real research and learn real facts about dinosaurs because they are fascinating (and so you can make annoying youtube comments criticizing the inaccuracies of a kids movie.)

And before I say my main point, the film does look gorgeous. The details on each of the dinosaurs, to the water effects, to the rock texture, it's technically beautiful. With that said, it looks like the biggest problem with this movie, is the main Dino itself. I myself am not against the idea of having a kid-like Dinosaur as the protagonist, but there needs to be some form of consistency. It just doesn't feel right having lush, detailed, realistic environments being inhabited by a googly-eyed squash and stretch machine like the main Dino. That's not to say that squash and stretch effects are bad, but it needs to fit in with the rest of the movie. Maybe I could look past it if it was just like a side character that comes in for about 2 scenes, but this is the main character! Not to mention the clashing styles of having realistic skin on this goofy character is very distracting. I'm not saying the film won't be good, because knowing Pixar, it'll have a polished script, excellent visuals, and a lasting effect on kids, but I can't help but point out something so distracting.",2015-07-23 01:41:00,0,0.2613690476190476,0.5151190476190476

NO DON translating in to NO TEETH!!! And if they call them ""pterodactyls"" I am going to get really upset.

I love dinosaurs, I love all 4 jurassic park movies despite their faults but this takes it too far, unless you make some drastic changes to this movie I will not see it.

I honestly do NOT care about the design of the main dinosaur, it's fine it's a cartoon but the rest SUCKS!!! INCLUDING THE NAME OF THE MOVIE!!!

Man I got mad but I don't hate pixar I JUST HATE THIS MOVIE.

Edit: I read the description AND IT ONLY MAKES IT WORSE if dinosaurs didn't become extinct mammals would not have become the dominant class on the planet thus they would not have become humans I mean Primates didn't even exist until 56 million years ago 8-9 million years away from the extinction of the dinosaurs and evolution works to help creatures adapt to environments so the odds of it being the same evolutionary path as without the dinosaurs is... well IT would not be the same humans (if they were to exist) would look so different that they would not be recognisable!!! 


Oh my god that was LONG and I know this is just a kids movie but man is it brainless you may be able to watch this just fine but I know I would not be able to watch this without correcting everything, (that's probably something wrong with me.) but I don't know all I can suggest is do real research and learn real facts about dinosaurs because they are fascinating (and so you can make annoying youtube comments criticizing the inaccuracies of a kids movie.)


Ps. this is just a cash in on the success of jurassic world (although thats nothing new just look at finding nemo while good it was just cashing in on the success of spongebob.)",2015-07-23 02:13:56,0,-0.047487065779748705,0.551940133037694

And before I say my main point, the film does look gorgeous. The details on each of the dinosaurs, to the water effects, to the rock texture, it's technically beautiful. With that said, it looks like the biggest problem with this movie, is the main Dino itself. I myself am not against the idea of having a kid-like Dinosaur as the protagonist, but there needs to be some form of consistency. It just doesn't feel right having lush, detailed, realistic environments being inhabited by a googly-eyed squash and stretch machine like the main Dino. That's not to say that squash and stretch effects are bad, but it needs to fit in with the rest of the movie. Maybe I could look past it if it was just like a side character that comes in for about 2 scenes, but this is the main character! Not to mention the clashing styles of having realistic skin on this goofy character is very distracting. I'm not saying the film won't be good, because knowing Pixar, it'll have a polished script, excellent visuals, and a lasting effect on kids, but I can't help but point out something so distracting.",2015-07-23 01:41:00,0,0.2613690476190476,0.5151190476190476

I felt that going with something slightly more realistic like how the land before time would have made the danger and the perils in the adventure even stronger. Every time I see those T. rex onscreen I have a hard time taking them seriously. But other than that looks interesting so far. 

It doesn't seem to have any sort of complex story going on. Most of the focus is on the young Dino getting back to his herd befriending the little boy. Admittedly this isn't the first time these sort of stories have been done but I'm curious to know what else is it going to offer. The relationship between the Dino and his boy have to be strong enough to hold the entire film if that's what it's ultimately going to be about.",2015-07-22 11:10:22,0,0.10395833333333333,0.5570833333333334

As of right now, I'm under the mindscape that this will be a 6.5/10 for me. From the trailer, it doesn't seem to be relying on comedy for much of the movie, meaning that it has to do something emotionally valuable. I watched YMS's review of Inside Out, and he's right for the most part that Pixar hasn't changed it's core plot points since the beginning, which makes all the films pretty repetitive and predictable. I consider myself a Pixar fan, but that doesn't mean I follow them to the bitter end. I just hope it has something more original in the story, especially after it was pushed back a year.",2015-07-22 06:34:02,0,0.12790178571428573,0.5443080357142858

2015-07-21T16:00:00.000Z,O-RgquKVTPE,The Good Dinosaur - Official US Trailer,"Bare in mind that even though this is all hypothetical to where this is a story if the asteroid/comet never hit earth, that single act could have changed and altered many things. Humans probably would have never existed as well as bananas, ect.  It was because of that supposed meteor/comet (or whatever took out the dinosaurs) that brought mass extinction upon the dinosaurs, as well as other plants and organisms, so that the small mammals would have less predators to worry about, thus could thrive and evolve into humans and other recognizable animals.

Another interesting fact is that modern humanoids and dinosaurs could not coexist for one reason; there was much more oxygen on the earth during the dinosaurs' reign. Humans wouldn't be able to breathe the thick O2 if they lived with dinos back before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and vice versa -- if Dinos lived with us today they wouldn't have enough oxygen to breathe for that's how they evolved to be so large. Humans evolved with the post extinction oxygen levels and most modern plants. Humans weren't always the omnivorous brutes we see today.

Why Pixar chose the whitest looking humanoid to play the homosapien-esque character is beyond me. Depends on what era it is and where they are geographically. Is this before or after the ice age? Is the story set in the Cretaceous/Paleogene era where the continents are still extremely close to each other? Or is it simply based in Africa? Humans just recently migrated out of Africa hundred thousand years ago, which is why there are different skin tones based on sun exposure. So it'd take a while for this little boys' and his people to have such lighter skin than their ancestors for this take place. At least several or more million years after those dinosaurs comically watched the meteor/comet pass by, humans were evolving, born, migrated to cooler climates and then we get the main story we see for any of this to make sense.

But I know... This is just a what if made for fun animated film for kids and a story about friendship. Looks good, I'm gonna see it. Just wanted to point this out if no one already did.",2015-07-21 21:20:57,2,0.11891741071428569,0.40703124999999996

They make a whole movie out of minions because they want to follow trends of what works instead of just making good movies.

The entire crew at Pixar, their movies have kept me going through multiple bouts of deep depression, & kept me focused on the goal I have of working with them. Finding Nemo taught me to just keep swimming, Monsters University taught me that my dream might work out in a much different way than I thought, Brave helped me to forgive my mom despite being exact opposites, & Inside Out taught me that it's okay to be sad, mad, disgusted, afraid, and joyful. I'm sorry that some people think that Pixar had lost their touch before inside out came out, but to me, they will never lose their touch as long as I live. #gooddino",2015-07-21 17:22:43,2,-0.1059090909090909,0.6116666666666667
