2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"i am a black girl, and in all honesty i cant see cinderella being black. Why? because of the historical inaccuracy. This story i'm guessing is set in england i presume, maybe during slavery, i'm not sure. How would that work? Cinderella's father would have had to be a rich black man, which i'm not sure was possible, before he left or died ( i'm not sure which style they're going to use) and probs married a black stepmother. Fine. What about the prince though, I doubt they can use a caucasian male to dance with the african female, and then marry her in the end. If they did, then the whole movie might be about the father not wanting an african princess, or the country not accepting her.Thus, its not even cinderella at all. It's another story entirely. Maybe if they changed the whole dynamic and made it a dystopian society then maybe it would work. But until that happens, let the european stories remain how they were written. Instead, let's make our own fairytales. Keep it in mind, these were stories written a while ago to adhere to society during those times. They can't just  change an important part of the lead character. New stories are being thought of every day.

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"This actually looks pretty good! It's surprisingly close to the original Cinderella (well, the cartoon one, at least), and the cast is new and refreshing as they are not all uber famous actors. Some people are complaining about the lack of racial diversity, but I am a woman of color myself, and I find no problem with it in this movie at least. It's historically accurate (I'm actually glad there aren't tons of black people in this movie. As accurate as Disney likes to be, they all would have had to be depicted as slaves or servants, and as horrible as that is, it's what people of color would have been in that era. I think we can all agree that has no place in this movie. Besides, it's a fairytale. Your kid doesn't give a shit what color skin the princess has, as long as she-or he- gets to wear a tiara just like hers). Just as movies like Mulan, Princess and the Frog, Aladdin, and Frozen were, the peoples' races are just as they would have been in that country and time period. That's some ace research and historical representation on Disney's part if I may say so. The only person who could have been more racially diverse is the Fairy Godmother, and that's my only complaint. She should have been something other than white, as she's a fairy, not a born and bred European. That was a wasted chance, imo. Otherwise though, I'm excited to see this! It looks really well-done, and I hope it turns out as awesome as it's presented to be! Though I must agree they showed WAY too much in this trailer... -__-
 And if you REALLY desire a racially diverse version of Cinderella, go watch Roger and Hammerstein's rendition of Cinderella. It's my favorite, and extremely well done! Cinderella is black, and so is her fairy godmother and the Queen. The Prince is Asian, and even one of the stepsisters is black. I absolutely recommend it, 10/10!",2014-11-20 12:09:50,0,0.1303746928746929,0.5485462735462735

I've read through a few negative comments, and I think - really? - sometimes we need to just 'chill' some people hit the gym. Some people smoke Weed. Some people do Yoga. Some people meditate.....and some people just live to a absurd themselves in a fantasy for an hour and a half!

The plot being the same as the old and classic Disney version was actually what I liked the most about this new one. Yes, we do want to see those stories that have been part of our childhood, magically created in real life with beautiful characters. Disney classic fairy tails are perfect the way they are and because we are so used to them since we were little kids, we consider them as the main version or the 'true' version (even though they aren't). Therefore, the only way to make it 'better' is by using innovative cinematic techniques, NOT by changing or adding new unrelated elements to the story. I actually find it disappointed when they recreate old movies and introduce a whole lot of things just to make it different or ""unseen"". It's as if they were trying to change our childhood memories and the only thing that goes through my mind is: ""No... that's not right! That's not what happened in the story... They're wrong"". It's the same kind of disappointment when we watch a movie based on a book we already read, because the images of our imagination are already in our heads (or in this case, images of our memories) and when people show it in a complete different way is kinda upsetting. Maleficent was different though, because they didn't tell us the same story in a complete different way. They introduced us a background (the truth underlying the classic story) and that's what made it different & good at the same time. Also, another thing that I found remarkably good in Cinderella is the casting chosen, especially Lily James. To play the main character you gotta know how to act as a real-princess (I'm using hyphen here because I'm not saying 'real' as in a ""true princess"", but as in a princess closer to reality). Well.. to explain it better, we don't live in Monarchies anymore so princesses are not part of our daily lives. Therefore, to represent something unreal (a princess) as real as possible, Lily James used nothing else than emotions - universal feelings !! - something we all can relate to :) She didn't have blank faces or fake crystallized tears like Mia Wasikowska in Alice in Wonderland or Elle Fanning in Maleficent. You can easily see her emotions only through her facial expressions, like her reaction when Lady Tremaine tells her to call her Madam, when she meets the prince (in this particularly scene she reminded me of Kate Winslet playing Rose in Titanic by the way *-*), her look of surprise when she touches the white horse, or even before that, when the fairy godmother appears it's possible to see her red face and swallow eyes because she was crying. PLUS she did all that still having the adorable, sweet, gentle and beautiful looks of a true princess. So in summary, Lily James easily portrayed Cinderella as a princess but simultaneously as a real person. I won't even talk about the prince (Richard Madden) but for now, all I'm gonna say is that when he said: ""Believe me they are all looking at you"" WOW! My heart melted. hahaha. In conclusion, I absolutely loved the fact that it followed the original one. I even loved how the colors of her dresses are the same from the old version and how she also uses a cloth on her hair as a maid. I loved all the similarities and even the small differences. And I loved how the dearest Disney princess was portrayed by the gorgeous Lily James :) I'm sooooooo looking forward to watching this movie <3

I wrote it when I realized that black people (look this up, proven at Harvard and Berkeley) are all to fucking stupid to read and write.  In fact, all the black people in Africa (not North Africa, don't start that shit...those are Caucasians you fucking morons) did not even have written languages until Europe and Asia brought theirs.

Sooo, that being said, here is my story......

Once Upon A Time, there is a black skanky bitch named Lowandasquisha and she lived in Detroit. Her mother is on the welfare and also on food stamps.   Lowandasquisha  eats a lot to escape her lonliness (she is ugly and fat....really fat....like how the fuck did you get that fat?????  kind of fat.  She also smells.

One day she eats so much that she crashes through the floor of their apartment and kills 73 people on the way down.   Well, in the ER she meets a nice crack head who tells her ""I am a Prince, and I am rich, but you have to let me fuck your ass every night for a month, then I will be at your service, and assistant if you will.""

So, Lowandasquisha  being desperate, and also an orphan (she killed her mom in the apartment disaster) gives up her big smelly ass to the crack head for 1 month.

After the month, she demands ""OK, you fucked my ass for a month, I want your assistance, you promosed.""

That is when the crack head said, ""Oh, you want me to aid you know?  Well, you might say, you already have it.....because I gave you the AIDS.""

But i like authenticity more than a good mix. Like seriously all the multicultural movies that been produce has been horrible. Btw the Cinderella story is not just based on the European fairy tales. For example, the Chinese version of Cinderella has been out like a thousand years earlier than the European counterpart. And even though it was first it would still be weird for me to see an all Asian cast on a western movie for Cinderella because your whole life you been taught in school and media that Cinderella is a typical northern Caucasian girl. Same thing like how Jesus was portrayed as a white man but in actuality he would look more middle eastern and wouldn't you feel weird if you seen Jesus looking like a middle eastern even though that's how he originally look like.",2014-11-20 08:43:19,1,0.0010869565217391313,0.3423913043478261

It's SO much better than all those horrible remakes where they hand the princes/heroine a sword and have her kill people and are like ""there. now she's like a male warrior. NOW we can respect her."" I just think Cinderella gets such a bad rap! The concept in valuing truth, patience, kindness and forgiveness above all, even in the face of abuse and bullying is REALLY powerful. It's so much easier to be like ""here, kill the bad guy."" But let's face it, that never happens in real life. This is a much more challenging, yet rewarding message. And as for the fancy gown at the ball- the point is, since this is the Perrault (not German) version of the fairytale, she gets rewarded with the gown from the fairy godmother and with help from the animals, because she is a good person! She gets rewarded with luxury and extravagance, for once, at the ball, because it is supposed to reflect her internal beauty. The idea is that good people, who are strong enough to remain good people, win out in the end. An optimistic lesson, yes, but probably more applicable to the real world, and a nice change from all the villain-obsessed flicks out lately.",2014-11-20 08:07:03,0,0.1854938271604938,0.5598765432098765

Stop being idiots. The only ones making an issue out of this are the people brining race into the discussion. Also can we please talk about the era this story was written? And if you want a cinderella with people of colour, there are tonnes of versions where they are represented - for example the Brandy and Whoopy Goldberg one. G

2) This is a fairytale. It is not meant to be logical. Fairytales are there to give us hope and by rationalising every aspect of the story you are completely missing the point and hence ruining it for yourself and everyone who wants to enjoy it. Let people dream. Actually, let children dream about finding prince charming and magic because we are allowed to. It is not some crime because people think it makes no sense.

Why does common sense go out the window when a production gets a huge budget? His skin is fine, just clean it and moisturize. If the lenses and lighting are good, he's going to look good. With 35mm and panavision cine glass, you're going to see the makeup and then if you try to blend it in post, you've created a bunch of work that never needed to be done and ended up making a really plastic looking image from $30,000 lenses. Waste of time and money and it doesn't look good. Everyone in the production chain has gotta get paid I guess.",2014-11-20 06:47:51,1,0.3236111111111111,0.5333333333333333

The problem is not that Cinderella is white, it's a Euro-tale so we know she was never created as a black girl. The problem is that Disney is white washed majorly, even when they do more colorful movies. That's the truth and if you don't see it you are ignorant or racist or stuck in a white bubble. They made a great movie with a black princess and dropped it quick. They have never made a truly colorful movie that reflected the culture fully, and they always got their whitewashes in there. Their shows and movies always feature one or two stereotypical blacks, asians, indians, indian(N.A.) or hispanic. Racism is still here and dominant even though people try to act like its not. I love Disney as I have worked for them and been mentored by some of their greatest artist and employees. BUT Disney is a company owned by a racist family, that caters to the dominant mind set of the white washed world. 
Now I'm a black girl who loves whites guys, Johnny Depp and fairy tales and even bad movies, so I will be seeing this with a smile. The only problem I have is that the movie looks a bit boring but hey. ",2014-11-20 06:37:54,28,-0.033143939393939385,0.5212121212121212

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"*sighs heavily after looking at some of the comment threads* why do people have to make such a big deal about whether the cast is diverse or not? It's not going to make much of a difference whether the cast is all Caucasian, African, Latino, Asian, Native American, Hawaiian, Russian, or Indian (you can add more to the list if you'd like); the only thing that's going to be effected is the setting. Disney chose to recreate the European version of Cinderella, so having a 95% Caucasian cast is to be expected. And before anyone says it, I am fully aware that Europe is not all Caucasian, but it is mostly Caucasian. And also, just because the cast is mostly Caucasian, doesn't automatically make the movie bad unless you the viewer decides that it will.

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"""Cinderella"": In the Brothers Grimm version, one of Cinderella's evil stepsisters cuts off her toes, and the other her heel so they can both fit into the tiny glass slipper. The prince is notified by little doves that there is blood on the shoe, and finally discovers that the true owner is Cinderella. Once the stepsisters realize that they should try to win favor with Cinderella (after all, she will be queen), they attend her wedding, only to have their eyes pecked out by birds

SOME OTHER SIDENOTES ON THIS STORY: Cinderella doesn't have a fairy godmother. Rather, she plants a tree by her mother's grave and prays under it every day. She finds her dresses to wear to each ball under the tree (there are three in the story, not one like in the movie). She is still helped by animals, though specifically birds, not mice. Also, she doesn't just lose her shoe because she is in a rush. The clever prince covers the steps in pitch to make her stick to them, but she only loses a shoe in the process.",2014-11-20 05:19:54,32,-0.0016025641025641012,0.6256410256410256

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,Out of all the disney princess movies they had to pick Cinderella. Maleficent was amazing because it showed another side to the story. The Cinderella story has been told time and time again. I think Cinderella is one of the most bland stories. They could have chosen Aladin or The Princess And The Frog or something more diverse. Aurora was a blonde haired blue eyed princess maybe take a break from that for a movie or two and show diverse princesses for little girls to look up to instead of the kind nice blonde haired blue eyed angel little princess. I would love to see a real life remake of The Princess and the Frog but sadly there are a lot of other white princess stories that will be remade before I see that. ,2014-11-20 04:48:39,4,0.13725490196078435,0.47696078431372546

ME: Nope, every single live-action version Disney does is going to suck.

This was flat, unenchanting, written-in, paint-by-number, and looked worse than all of the movies like ""Ella Enchanted"" which basically tried to knock off of animated versions. You hear that, Disney? Your live action movies are worse than the movies that are made to try and imitate you and be pale facsimilies. I couldn't even watch past 1:30 because I realized it just went ""downhill"" from there. Why don't they just throw in some evil army for Cinderella to defeat in a fantasy battle while they're at it and complete the downgrade... That or Johnny Depp.

Although the step mom and the stepsisters are beautiful on the outside their personalities are ugly and rude. The girl playing cinderella is by no means plain or ugly she is average but what is shining through is her personality we hear her mom saying that she is very nice and kind meaning that she has a humble and caring personality which is far more beautiful and important  than that of outer beauty. I personally think this is a positive message for little girls, young girls, and women in general. Beauty fades but your inner most beautiful personality lasts longer. I applaud the director for this take of the a classic fairy tale story. ",2014-11-20 02:25:20,0,0.18217306998556995,0.6369137806637807

It's true, though, that the trailer appears to be pretty much the entire film condensed to under 3 minutes. And unless it's deliberately omitting something, it seems to be basically the same fairy tale over again. 
HBC as the fairy godmother would've convinced me even if I hadn't already been expecting to like it, though. 


What with this, 'Maleficent,' the Sleeping Beauty re-release, that 7D cartoon (which looks rather deeply unappealing to me), and Into the Woods (which involves a version of Cinderella as well as mentions Sleeping Beauty), Disney is really putting a lot of focus on their earliest princesses--or things related to those original fairy tales. I think I would rather see, instead of just further lavish live-action remakes, some real quality continuations of the princess stories...maybe even crossing them over with one another...but that would take a heck of a lot more inspiration. ",2014-11-20 01:59:38,1,0.16250000000000003,0.5277777777777779

That's the best you can come up with, Disney, for meaningful parting words? I know it sounds so picky but just that wooden phrasing is putting me off. It just seems emotionless and careless. I was expecting the script to be a little less painful than that...
And is anyone else bothered by the color of her dress? I prefer the light blue-gray from the original over this almost gaudy bright blue-purple color, which (as someone very accurately said before me) looks like something out of Nanny McPhee
I wish Disney would spend more time and effort on their movies instead of churning out these mediocre, CGI heavy pieces. Cinderella is my favorite Disney Princess, but everything about this trailer seems careless and money-seeking.",2014-11-20 00:52:23,2,0.0705701754385965,0.6810526315789475

I don't see it as Disney re-making a film just because they already did the story once. Re-making would imply they're basing it off the original movie. This one looks like it's just them doing the story of Cinderella again, with a much more fleshed out story and less singing. Not a re-make, but a re-telling (though I admit, they do use the same names for the step-family and the general designs to a degree, such as Drizella's weird bow on her head). Either way, though, this is not the first live-action adaptation Disney did of Cinderella since making the animated adaptation.

To my amusement, this movie will be directed by the one and only Gilderoy Lockhart, and will have the great Sir Derek Jacobi in it.",2014-11-20 00:46:32,0,0.18257575757575759,0.5931818181818181

If they had just told the story of Maleficent and left Aurora out of it, the movie would have been much better.

I've noticed errors and it's only the trailer. First, though we don't know for sure if they met before the events of the movie. Cinderella and the Prince didn't meet. But that's me being nit picky. Second. The horse drove the carriage not a duck. I didn't event notice Bruno (the dog) Fourth. The mice don't talk. She may not have spoken to them a lot in the movie but at least she could understand them. And another nit-picky thing. Her dress isn't right.

It had a good plot for Aurora and Maleficent's relationship but I didnt like how Maleficent was betrayed by the man she loved twice. I also didnt like how Aurora's father was a greedy and selfish king who had no trouble in betraying a woman he onced loved, let alone a woman who had done nothing to him that deserved such cruelty.",2014-11-19 22:00:11,0,0.30404040404040406,0.5838383838383838

Yeah there's a plague of metrosexual libtard, feminist, gullible dupes and disempowered, weak nerds desperate to feel superior and powerful by identifying with evil. They live in their mum's basements and yearn to be a Sith Lord and claim some sort of artistic credibility by only describing their newest fancy by the adjectives 'darker', 'edgier' and the 'good guy loses'.
These types fawn over evil but when evil affects them they go crying to mummy and curl up in a foetal position.

Malificent was anti-male, New world order, social engineering propaganda. Pretty transparent to anyone with a brain.﻿
Here's why:
The reason that the globalist elite have been pushing feminism is because men are the biggest threat to their control of the populations. In every takeover or suppression of an enemy throughout history the men were taken out first. Men are more likely to view totalitarian authority as an alpha male threat whereas women are more likely to view it as a protector (related to women liking the 'bad boys'). Men are thus more likely to challenge authority and are physically more dangerous.

Globalist inspired feminism is also about societal divide and conquer. They need to destroy the social fabric to make it harder for familial relationships to form particularly between men and women as families provide cohesion and resistance against tyranny. So pushing women to abandon traditional nurturing female traits and to pursue male qualities creates friction as men have evolved to protect and compliment women not compete with them. Relationships have become harder to form between men and women, divorce is at an all time high, marriage at an all time low as women abandon their biological natures in favour of pursuing masculine traits, ending up with internal conflict and they are often unhappy.

At the heart of feminism lies deception. Feminism was created by the power elite as a communist tool (modelled off Stalinesque Russian female empowerment techniques) to make society more divided, more matriarchal and thus more controllable.",2014-11-19 17:07:13,3,-0.019168212739641335,0.5290630797773656

I just want to point out that I personally felt Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland was an enjoyable film. Not great but not bad. I know I'm not gonna make alot of friends by saying that but screw it, it's my opinion, dammit! You don't have to agree, just don't be a self-centered jerk about it.

Now admittedly the only thing I'm worried about the film is it's writer who previously co-wrote The Nutty Professor 2 and did the screenplay for The Golden Compass. You may now engage shivering with fear.

But this is director Kenneth Branagh for god's sake. He did one of the more well-known adaptations of Hamlet and successfully managed to bring Thor to the big screen properly.

Hopefully he knows what he's doing and maybe this could wipe off the bad taste of Maleficent and restore Disney's dignity. Not saying it could be good, I'm just saying maybe you could cut them a little slack.

There is talent behind this project so all we could do is wait and see.",2014-11-19 16:59:04,11,0.08240740740740739,0.5027777777777778

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"Few things to note to all the HATERS and DISLIKERS
1) Cinderella's mother is shown( Did Disney showed her dining the animated version?No!)
2) The fairy godmother would have a bigger role in this film
3) The stepmother has cinderella's freaking shoe!
4) Cinderella met the prince before the ball
5) The Grand Duke would have a more sinister role in this version
6)  This movie would be told by the Prince's point of view 
Out of this 6 notes how many of this “ideas"" have been put to other  Cinderella movies in the world? 0 to 1 and all of you are saying it's bland,unoriginal, sh*t,bad or any other things that are negative please think again.

You definitely don't know how Hollywood works, do you? It's a big financial gamble if the studios were to invest in something new. If a producer or director were to approach the studios with an original story, then they, along with many other people, are at risk of losing their job. Why do you think a lot of studios are now taking the safe route by spawning out remakes and reboots? They know that people who are familiar with these stories will pay to see it. It's show business. Besides, there have been a large number of original films out there, but they're either unheard of, or they didn't do so well. Quit your complaining and stop falling into the category of a ""whinger"".",2014-11-19 14:06:35,1,0.2136953955135773,0.4416469893742621
