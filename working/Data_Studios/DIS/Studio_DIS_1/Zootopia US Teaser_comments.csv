You don't have to be a child to find anthropomorphic animals to be funny or cute. Most of use grew up with anthropomorphic animals that we watched.
Liking anthropomorphic animals, finding them cute or funny doesn't make you a furry. Even if you are, there's nothing wrong with that and people need to stop finding films like these as an excuse to bash a harmless community.
This is also DISNEY. Much of what they have done involves anthropomorphic animals. Why should this surprise anyone?

Disney, YOU have used anthropomorphic creatures in almost all of your movies. This concept itself, of a world made of entirely anthropomorphic animals, is also /not/ an original idea, which you seem to be attempting to pass it off as. There's this thing called the ""furry community"" (an actually great crowd full of good people that has an unfortunate and unjustified reputation). I'm not complaining, stories/worlds like this are great! And the furry community could definitely use some positive exposure. I just feel like it's kind of a kick in the leg to the countless people who have made stories and graphic novels like this when you say it's ""like nothing seen before."" Other than that little line, this seems amazing, and I'm pretty excited for it! I'd just be nice if you stopped advertising it in a way that makes it seem like you're trying to sell it as an original concept.

(excluding the furry community) Here's a short list of shows and movies that have already done this decades before this film: Swat Kats, Chicken Little, Tale Spin, Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, The Paw Paws, Thundercats, Babar, Samurai Pizza Cats, Fantomcat, Disneys Robin Hood. But the one thing that Zootopia does different, seems to be the only movie of it's kind to focus a lot on the fact that there are no humans. They're trying to make it seem like They're unique for being aware of this. As if Disney is doing something new, groundbreaking and unheard of.

The only twist here it seems is that humans are animals.

Mine was about humans nearly going extinct from a major plague so the leading scientists of the world saved two of each animal (like Noah's Arc) and gave them human intelligence so that when mankind was gone, their legacy would still live on earth. In the future, the animals evolved from the experiments and became anthro, wore clothes and built civilizations (except unlike Zootopia's animals, they're against technology) but they still have the same flaws that humans had: They separate themselves by species and fight with each other. There is one area in the middle of all the nations however that welcome all species and that's where my series takes place.",2015-06-12 00:02:22,2,-0.04472402597402598,0.37678571428571433

Rabbit girl want to be acknowledge for her police skill or is stuck with traffic duty but want to prove herself to be a good cop. She some how witness a crime and cant do it alone and try to get help for the cops that do heavier police work but they don't listen or they go out and find nothing a few times and gave up listening to her. She comes across a fox who could be a eye witness the this crime or have some role or have information on the crime. But also notice that he had a warrant for his arrest or she witness a criminal act that he had done (mostly scamming someone) and blackmailed him to help her to find the criminals and bring them in. As they search for clues they fought along the way but later gain respect for each other (maybe after they tell there personal stories) as they closed in they end she wanted to do everything herself but the fox suggested to calling backup. But after going in and trying to take down the bad guys they end up failing and getting captured and out of some reason the hideout gets destroyed and altered the other cops just to find the two and she end up losing her job and (if the fox had a warrant) he would be put into prison. After sometime in depression after losing her job she encourage herself out of some reason and brakes the fox out of jail (of he encourage her to try again out of some reason). and goes out and try again and succeed (the evil boos might be killed or arrested) and then ends up getting her job back.
The fox might join the force, walk of into the sunset, or ends up in some relationship with her if they go the romance way.

As for the characters I know the fox and bunny is the main but mostly the fox. As for support characters, I think there is gonna be a kinda of a sidekick for the fox maybe a weasel that helps him with some black-market goods or information. And I'm guessing there might be some connection with him in the movie villain and yes I know there is one, theirs always one. I'm not sure what he is gonna be, as for the cops, many top of the food chain and large and strong animals and I'm guessing the commissioner maybe a Lion. And I'm guessing there might be a scene she heads to her parents house and her mom and dad thought she brought home a boyfriend and she could be living with them to

As for personality goes, the Fox is a scammer with a smooth talk to talk his way out of anything. a smartas* but short sighted. The bunny is cleaver, mommas girl or daddy's girl or both,... ok that's all I can think up on.
