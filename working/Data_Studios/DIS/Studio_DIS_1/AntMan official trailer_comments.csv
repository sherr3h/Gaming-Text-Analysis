I'm kinda surprised that despite the great humor (which let's be real here people, isn't the script itself but just what's probably left over from the Edgar Right days, which Marvel, I'm still angry at you for), it still looks really bland. It's like all the issues of the MCU have been distilled down into one film. Uninteresting human characters, bland and rehashed plots, and for a franchise about a connected universe, there is a total lack of consequences. Hopefully Phase 3 changes these issues, but for now, even GotG felt like the same plot as EVERY OTHER MOVIE IN THIS FRANCHISE, just in a more fun coating. It's funny that the best of the MCU isn't even in theaters anymore (Daredevil is amazing!).",2015-04-14 11:42:34,0,0.1722013366750209,0.5205931495405179

2015-04-13T12:56:49.000Z,pWdKf3MneyI,Marvel&#39;s Ant-Man - Trailer 1,"I recognize the importance of building and maintaining the shared cinematic universe, and yeah, Ant Man seems comparatively small (that's not a pun, I swear) to just about everyone else save maybe Speedball in terms of possible import. But if they can make this cool and fun and up-to-snuff, and it certainly looks like they can, I say, so what?
Take Ant Man and make a awesome, funny movie if you know you can, because even if it doesn't contribute a whole lot to the wider shared universe (though no-one expected Iron Man to hint at SHIELD and the Avengers when it did, so who knows), if it's good and fun, we'll all be better of for it. 

I actually kind of hope they don't try and shove in universe-building just to get it in there and make Ant Man seem relevant to the rest of the MCU. That shoving in of the universe really kinda brought down Iron Man 2 and Guardians, to an extent (moreso to an extent with Guardians, because we do need to see a bit of Thanos before Infinity Wars, but he also really kind of subsumed Ronan as the big bad, which he technically could do, but making the main villain of the film rather subservient to a mostly off-screen villain rarely works well).

Ant Man, I think, could easily have the same problem of them trying to cram in universe-building stuff to sort of justify the existence of the movie, however briefly-seen yet overshadowing said crammed stuff is, and that would be a shame. It would be a shame because this looks like it could be something on the scale of Iron Man 1; something with the truly perfect blend of seriousness and silliness, that strikes that perfect tone and story for a true, unabashed, unashamed super hero film. Guardians and Winter Soldier came damn close to that ideal, but those were as much space opera and spy flick as they were superhero films, dragged down ever so slightly by the conventions of their subgenres. The Thors and the other Iron Men were alright, but they were less tight and more burdened, carrying the weight of establishment and continuation while at times forgetting some key aspects (every portrayal of Iron Man since 1 has forgotten he grew out of his irreverent, doesn't-think-long-term shithead phase (mostly) halfway through the first movie, while Odin in Dark World seemed much less diplomatic and reasonable and Odin-like, for lack of a better term, purely so Thor could be in the right on what to do about who to love and fight and how). Iron Man 1 was pure, perfect super hero greatness on scale we never comprehended before, and we haven't truly had a solo Marvel film live up to that standard since. It's come close, inarguably, but it's also always stopped just short. We could get that again here, I feel like.",2015-04-14 07:35:49,0,0.2293985307621671,0.5267388167388167

   antman , as much as i want it to be awesome, does not look good. it doesnt look horrible, but nothing from marvel will look horrible in a trailer.  im pretty sure this is gonna be the first marvel movie that doesnt crush at the box office, the tone is all over the place, it has some really hokey action scenes where they are far too comic-bookey and some even going into the slapstick realm (train scene). whatever money this movie makes will be in the first weekend. after that its gonna tank in the numbers and fall away. i hope im wrong, but im calling it. this one, unfortunately, is gonna be the first marvel movie that nobody really cares for. bad direction and the practical effects and even cgi look a little sub-par for a marvel film. if you count avengers as a 10 and iron man 3 as a 6 or a 7, id have to say this one would probably come in at a round a 4 maybe a 5. marvel will just put out another movie and that will be the end of antman. hell never be back.",2015-04-14 04:51:32,0,0.0418019480519481,0.5680203823953822

But there seem to be TOO much Superhero movies. I think it would be better for Marvel to not make that many movies. Many of them will be generic and one dimensional.

I'm both a fan of film and comics. I'd rather not see some of my favorite comic book characters be tainted by mediocre/bad movies. But it seems like anything passes for other comic book fans these days... No standard or appreciation for the art-forms it seems all they have to be is ""cool"" and geeky enough.

I rant a lot about this but I feel like DC is trying to do the same thing. Instead of pushing for a more serious approach like the NOlan films, they're going for mindless action and zero depth. Just pumping out films like they're products... I had high hopes for MoS but it just ended up being a very boring film with no depth and intelligence. Poor directing from Snyder in the end.

Do you know that Marvel was developing this film ever since the times of the first Iron Man? Do you know that Ant-Man was a founding Avenger? Do you know that Hank Pym created Ultron? Do you know that he increases in size as well, becoming giant man? Do you know that his character is very complex and has gone through many controversial changes? Do you even know anything about the character? If the answer to all these questions is no, then you shouldn't judge the character so strongly before seeing him. If the answer is yes, then I can understand why you are not inclined to like the character. As for the movie itself, I shall only sincerely judge it after it comes out, and I hope you do the same.

He has the comedic ability to help this film not totally fail because the way I see it, if you are making an 'Ant-man' film, the only way to ensure it isn't just embarrassingly stupid is to make it genuinely funny (as well as fun, which it totally looks like it is). Paul Rudd has gotten better at humour stuff over the years and he's very likeable anyway, and they even had the mind to make fun of the name Ant Man, because how can anyone take that seriously.

I love the Avengers movie (It's my favourite movie of all time) but you have to admit that with powers it is lacking, a guy who flies, a guy with super strength and a shield, another guy with super strength but a hammer instead of shield which he sometimes uses to shoot lightning or launch into the air, a big guy with super strength, a guy with a bow and arrow, a woman with pistols, not saying it's bad it's just we haven't had that much different powers, guardians of the galaxy is the same, a strong guy, a great fighter, a guy with guns, a racoon with guns (rocket is still badass though) the only exception there is Groot, I'm not complaining I'm just saying how great it is now that we are getting to more varied powers, super speed, magic, earth quakes, teleporting, spider powers, and of course shrinking, this is what I like, varied powers and heroes teaming up with these varied powers and using them together, to be fair though, a lot of the heroes with all the varied powers are or were owned by other companies, xmen, fantastic four, spiderman and ghost rider is what I'm mainly talking about, luckily now marvel have spiderman (sort of) and ghost rider back, xmen is so far fine with fox and while I do want xmen in the mcu, fox is doing okay with the franchise right now and I would like them to at tie up all loose ends before stopping, but fantastic four, yeah they need to just stop and give the rights back to marvel there, but anyway enough ranting, now that all these heroes are now getting more varied powers than just flight and super strength or no powers at all, the mcu is getting even better and we'll probably get even better fights (I recently finally watched the new spongebob movie and I will say, the powers in that movie are awesome! they use them competently, and they are varied, that was a great example of different powers all mixed together, another great example is xmen days of future past with all the future fights, that imo is one of the best uses of varied powers mixed together in any comic book movie I have seen so far!) but back to what I was talking about, now that we have shrinking, it's definitely gonna lead to some awesome fight scenes and I so can not wait!

""Seriously, this trailer didn't get me excited at all. It will bomb.""
""Yeah, this may be the downfall of MCU, it's so going to fail.""
""This shit looks so bad. Ant Man's suit looks stupid, talking to ants is stupid, how this shit going to work? Major bomb right here.""

But this is still better than the first teaser trailer and quite decent. There still are some generic and just kinda cheesy moments in here and the audio could have been edited a lot better. The jokes still are predictable and not as funny as they should be. But my hopes for the movie are back - from the trailers I also didn't believe in Daredevil and that turned out to be really good.^^
The music here is a custom version of Hi-Finesse's ""Visionary"" - just as in the teaser for this trailer.",2015-04-13 13:08:15,0,0.19743589743589743,0.5
