Of course i'm not saying it's a bad film it's still a good film from Pixar, just the weakest out of them all. Also, that's all honestly your own opinion on Cars. I didn't find the storyline predictable or anything and it didn't feel lazy, it felt like a lot of work was put into it such as any other Pixar film. Cars 2 is still up there in my favorite Pixar films. :3",2012-06-21 06:19:39,0,0.19318181818181818,0.731060606060606

I probably won't be seeing it in theaters, but i'll definately check it out when it comes out on DVD. Also, if you can tell me if it's good or not?

Pixar has never really explored the humor of college life before, I'm interested to seeing what they can pull off. And it'll be cool to see a movie more focused around Mike and Sulley's friendship. Trust me, I love Boo, but I think that Pixar ended her story pretty well. Will we get to see her older in the future, maybe. PLEASE don't expect Pixar to ALWAYS make groundbreaking films, that's why Disney has taken a downfall because of all the PRESSURE on them.",2012-06-20 16:24:00,0,0.16166666666666668,0.4708333333333333
