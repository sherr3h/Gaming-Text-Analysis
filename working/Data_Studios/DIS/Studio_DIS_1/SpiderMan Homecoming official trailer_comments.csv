BLM protesters are bashing this movie bc good ol whiteboy Peter Parkers love interest is a mixed girl. They aren't joking either. They are claiming this movie is racist and the white supremacist director is showing how white people just take whatever they want. That Spider-Man pretty much is raping the mixed girl.

I like the new suit, kind of works with this younger spider-man.

And also the actor looks believably in high school and nerdy. Okay maybe not super nerdy but it's in there.,2016-12-10 05:28:51,59,0.3306666666666666,0.5093333333333333
