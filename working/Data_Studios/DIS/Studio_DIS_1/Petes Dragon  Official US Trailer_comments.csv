Looking at the dragon itself it's... er... not too well designed and is something a kid would come up with after watching HTTYD and playing a game of Halo. ""An amphibious dragon with active camo!!!11""

Other than that I already know the plot:

They discover a ""lost child"" who's been gone for X years and finally comes back to civilization. Shock! Awe! He couldn't POSSIBLY have survived out in the wilderness on his own(Plothole btw)! Wait, what's that? He was raised by a DRAGON!?

And from there the sequence of events that unfold in these movies: Somebody either thinks it's too dangerous OR wants to utilize it as weapon, they enter a conflict stage where the human people try to get the ""bad guys"" off it's back, showdown stage where they almost capture it, but the dragon escapes thanks to the boy's miraculous control over the dragon. Bad guy is killed, falling bridge style, and they all live happily ever after.

Honestly they've been rehashing this same plot throughout their recent movies, and I guarantee it'll happen with BFG.",2016-06-15 10:39:38,27,-0.04609848484848486,0.4541666666666667

TOO. MUCH. NOT CARING ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS.
 I swear Walt Disney is turning in his grave over new Disney movies. if you look back at his old movies, they are SOOOOOO different from newer ones. take Cinderella for instance. a girl who's misunderstood by her family gets what she's always wished for at a price. it's a story we've seen a million times, even back when it was made, but it works! why? because Walt Disney didn't focus too much on making the movie so appealing to certain audiences or about remaking things. he cared about showing only the people who had an actual reason to be there. the things we saw in those older movies, in a characteristic perspective, were things that no one had ever seen before, and were interesting, magical, and important. think of any old movie made by Disney himself. now think of characters in that movie who didn't have a reason to be there. mind blown.
If new Disney wants to make a movie, and I mean the first fantastic one they've made in a long time, they need to go in the opposite direction of where they're going now. DO NOT focus on bring old characters into the 21st century. sure it looks and feels cool but it doesn't last. it's like making a new candy, and then making a smoothie version. it lasts way longer, and you can enjoy it long term instead of just eating it, and being done. no one above the age of sixteen cares about old being rethought. absolutely no one.",2016-06-15 06:21:56,0,0.15784843779408997,0.42744925967752045

Variety in creature designs is never a bad thing and a lot of dragons tend to only have 2 portrayals in movies even though they appear in many cultures besides Eastern and Western interpretations.I honestly don't remember much of the original but I recall that Elliot wasn't exactly what one would call an intimidating creature by any big degree  even as far as cartoon dragons go from Disney so I can see what they did here. From what little I do recall he behaved like a friendly big dog more then a dragon that explains the face.

(I feared they'd try and make him look like one of Daenerys' dragons, in an effort to make a ""darker and more serious"" film. xD) Looks as though they went the more middle-ground, How-to-Train-Your-Dragon-esque route. Can't help feeling that the first Elliot will have more personality and this'll be another by-the-numbers, forgettable, uninspired story. I guess it has a little potential, but honestly, this is what I'd been expecting Brave to be: adults gang up on child's/teen's ""dangerous"" animal friend, like Gaston's angry mob on the Beast...main character and allies have to protect it from those who don't understand it...yadda.",2016-06-15 01:07:41,0,0.09320175438596492,0.6728070175438597

If someone had told me that this was directed by Steven Spielberg or J.J. Abrams (who directed ""Super 8"" which felt very much like a Spielberg film), I would believe them. Looks like David Lowery is certainly someone to keep an eye on as this film looks visually stunning. It's no wonder that they are entrusting him with Disney's future ""Peter Pan"" live-action adaptation. I'm liking the small nods to the original with the phrase ""I Saw A Dragon"" at the end, and the capture of Elliot. I could almost see this as more of a sequel to ""Pete's Dragon"" seeing as it takes place in a modern Pacific Northwest forest as opposed to the coastal town of Passamaquoddy, Maine in the early 19th century. Lest we forget, at the end of the original film Elliot left to help another kid in trouble. I hope the film includes nods to the songs that won't be included, or that ""Candle On The Water"" at least be played during the end credits. So far, this looks to be a fun family adventure at any rate. :) ",2016-06-15 00:37:56,0,0.1769187675070028,0.49547619047619046
