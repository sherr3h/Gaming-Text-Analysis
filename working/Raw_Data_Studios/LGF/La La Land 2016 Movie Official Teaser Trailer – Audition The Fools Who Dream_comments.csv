And tumbled into the Seine
The water was freezing
She spent a month sneezing
But said she would do it again

Here's to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that ache
Here's to the mess we make

She captured a feeling
Sky with no ceiling
The sunset inside a frame

She lived in her liquor
And died with a flicker
I'll always remember the flame

and the MUSIC...wow...i honestly didn't expect at all that the music/soundtracks is all going to be really THIS GOOD,.!!  üëç üëç
it's mostly jazz/jazzy, broadway, as well as dreamy classical which kinda reminds you of the old-classics ""Singing in the Rain"",. i really LOVE all the music soundtracks in this film/movie very much!!  üëç üëç
 ..it's been a LONG while to see a 'musical' genre movie like this...that also really moved me, & deeply touched my emotions, warm/warmth, as well as imaginations soo much,.. . . !! :')

==============================================
My aunt used to live in Paris
I remember, she used to come home and tell us
stories about being abroad and
I remember that she told us she jumped in the river once,
Barefoot

She smiled,
Leapt, without looking
And tumble into the sand
The water was freezing
she spent a month sneezing
but said she would do it, again

Here's to the ones
who dream
Foolish, as they may seem
Here's to the hearts
that ache
Here's to the mess
we make

She captured a feeling
Sky with no ceiling
Sunset inside a frame
She lives in her liqour,
and died with a flicker
I'll always remember the flame

Here's to the ones
who dream
Foolish, as they may seem
Here's to the hearts
that ache
Here's to the mess
we make

She told me:
A bit of madness is key
to give us to color to see
Who knows where it will lead us?

And that's why they need us,
So bring on the rebels
The roles from pebbles
The painters, and poets, and plays

And here's to the fools
who dream
Crazy, as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that break
Here's to the mess we make

I trace it all back,
to that
Her, and the snow, and the Seine 
Smiling through it
She said
She'd do it, Again",2016-12-14T08:56:00.000Z,8

Those exact two names shit charisma and likability. I mean, Emma Stone was horribly annoying in Aloha - YET I didn't mind!

Possibly the most visually beautiful film I've ever seen. The full version of this song should be all Emma Stone needs to win the Best Actress Oscar. Damien Chazelle has made something very special indeed. Think Amelie meets A Star is Born with a little touch of Singing in the Rain and even the Jazz Singer, filtered through Rogers and Hammerstein Cinemascope/Techinicolor and you're nearly there. I am not going to say another romantic film it reminded me of as it would give the entire plot away but it is a classic, this will be too.",2016-10-09T22:56:49.000Z,1

The one thing that keeps me at bay with that prediction is I wonder if the role will have enough depth (Either from the story or her performance). Other than that, it certainly seems like a sure bet - It's seems like a graceful, fully embodied role, and it sees Stone demonstrating a singing talent we haven't really seen from her before.

Of course, I can't vouche for this entirely because I haven't seen the bloody movie. As it stands, I'm not sure if its an absolute lock, but I have hopes for her.",2016-09-25T03:10:37.000Z,0

L'unica pecca √® il finale, se avessero tagliato gli ultimi tre minuti e fatto finire il film nella scena dei ricordi, sarebbe stato pi√π bello e ambiguo, perci√≤ pi√π adatto alla dimensione onirica del film.I saw it this night in venice and it was dreamy! He is fantastic, sweet in his crazyness and gentle with her... I've got a thing for ryan gosling! Apart from fangirl things, the director did an excelent work, (some facts can be explained without a word) the only thing i don't like is the ending, if they would've cut the last three minutes and made it ending in the memories' scene it would've been more beautiful and unclear, so more suitable to the dreaming dimension of the movie",2016-09-01T00:30:37.000Z,0

I thought it would be like every hopeless romance out there. Sure Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are good actors that I appreciate but I still wouldn't go out of my way to see it. I would just wait for it to go to rent or something but then I saw this trailer and I heard this song... And I quite honestly can't wait for it to come out. The fact that it only hints at the story and that the music is so enchanting it immediately got my attention. I'm intrigued and ready to watch.,2016-08-30T22:08:43.000Z,0
