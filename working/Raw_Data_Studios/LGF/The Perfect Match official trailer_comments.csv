I know he produced it but wow this seems like just an ego project for him. Just my opinion. Alot of style over substance.  Who says you can't have style AND substance???

Also black men are the BIGGEST HYPOCRITES! They complain about racism and not being given opportunities because of their skin color but then turn around and do the same thing to black women. They are REPLACING black women with BIRACIAL/ LATINA women...ALL THE ""BLACK"" women in this are ALL BIRACIAL and pass the PAPER BAG TEST. I noticed this has been happening in black media since the mid 2000s or so because before that black women of all complexions were celebrated (from Gabby Union to Nia to Meagan to Halle). Now it's only LIGHT black women. They even had a BIRACIAL woman play Nelson Mandela's AFRICAN wife and another BIRACIAL playing Will Smith's character AFRICAN wife in Concussion and another BIRACIAL playing Storm, an african character. I don't mind biracials getting more roles than black women but this is getting ridiculous. I wish black women will make a rom com with ONLY BIRACIAL/LATINO/WHITE men.",2016-02-17T02:44:10.000Z,18
