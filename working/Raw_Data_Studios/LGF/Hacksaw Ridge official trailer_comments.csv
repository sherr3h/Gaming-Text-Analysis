2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"I haven't watched it yet for some reason...I will watch it soon. By looking at this trailer the sh_t seems gritty as hell, which means it is probably a close representation of what it was actually like to be there (God bless our fallen soldiers from WWII - and all of our wars to be honest).


I applaud Gibson and everyone else who was a part of this film - especially the actor playing the main character. As for the real life soldier who actually DID this???? I am humbled by the fact that he existed in this same life and reality as I do, but that I could never measure up to him... I salute that  man.


I have NO PROBLEM going into battle or marching straight into the jaws of certain death. I've had some experiences in my life that make me the first guy to volunteer for whatEVER suicide mission is at hand and is needed to help us survive. I have zero fear of death. I can tell you that, because I used to be a boy in life and the kind of person we all start as, where when the going gets tough, and some sh_t comes up that NOone wants to do and probably won't came back from....we would hope we didn't get picked for that mission lol. I remember being that person and what it felt like and I can guaranTEE you that TODAY? NO ONE could ever even be CAPABLE of keeping me from being the first man in line to go do some sh_t that everyone else is too scared to do.


I'm a real man our here. All the little boys can take notes. As for THIS soldier.... This guy is about 100,000 times the man I am, because he wouldn't fire a weapon. By God if I need to go over some hill and kill me some enemies, you strap me up with the right guns and ammo, and you can't stop me from going after that target. I refuse to die a coward. A death while being brave is all I yearn for in this life and will probably be denied it since I'm a civilian now (used to be in the military).


To have the balls to march into battle with NO WEAPON in hand.....and refusing to fire a weapon....I take my hat off and bow down to this man. He redefines brave. Honestly, I suspect he wasn't even all human....the level of power and bravery he exhibited must be on the level of immortal angels walking the face of the earth. I bow down.....",2019-04-14T00:52:24.000Z,1

John 14:6 KJV, ""Jesus saith, I am the WAY, the TRUTH, and the LIFE: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.""

1 Peter 2:24 NIV, ""He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed.""

John 3:16 KJV, ""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life"".  

Romans 3:23-24 NIV, ""...for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified by His grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus"".

John 8:12 KJV, ""I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life"". 

Jesus is the only WAY to God, the TRUTH of salvation, and the Breath/Bread of LIFE. 

ACCEPT Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour. Sins separate us from God because He's Holy. All sins will be forgiven and erased through faith in Christ Jesus. God ♥ you, is alive, merciful, faithful, truthful, and is waiting with His arms wide open FOR YOU! For Jesus did not come to establish a religion, but to become a mediator between God and men.

Through the Grace of God, Jesus was given to us by paying the price at the Cross at Calvary. Repent and confess from your sins to Jesus and ask Him to forgive you. A sinner cannot save a sinner, only a sinless person can. That sinless Being is Jesus Christ Himself.

Through the faith in Christ Jesus, the sick was healed; everywhere He went, He healed the blind, the mute, the deaf, the demon-possessed, raised the dead, as well as performed many miracles; He also walked on water, turned water into wine, calmed the storm with His command, and was raised up from the dead. Miracles are still being seen today! Jesus is our helper, our healer, our refuge/protection, and our strength for when time gets tough.

God is standing and knocking at the door waiting for your answer right now because THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN IS COMING.

In the movie he made it clear that he dont want to hold a rifle he disobyed direct orders and used the name of god to justify hes actions that later sent his bonnie ass to jail. In jail his gf told him to ""just pretend to hold a rifle and not use it"" Doss with all his high and mighty pride refused to even consider his gf's opinion. Half way through the ending we saw pvt dickhead held a rifle and used it to drag vince vaughn ass down the hill. What a load of BULLSHIT

So yes, his gf and the officers is right about him all along hes just a stubborn prick who uses  his religious convictions and waives it like a badge of honor.

I expected it was good, but I got blown away! This film is up there among the very best War movies ever, like The Dear Hunter, Das Boot,  Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Band of brothers (series), Letters from Iwo Jima etc. I thought of Forrest Gump too, cause he ran back to save a lot of fallen men. But Hacksaw Ridge is true story. He was so much braver than they thought. So many times it could have gone wrong when he went back to help the fallen soldiers, he was very often split seconds away from death. Kicking away the grenades at the end was epic!",2018-01-29T15:04:26.000Z,67

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"The portrayal of violence in this film completely undermined the themes. This should have been a grittier film. The battle sequences felt like the musings of someone with a romanticised image of war, or rather someone actively trying to communicate the horrors of war but failing miserably.

The rest of the movie is very effective, but you know what I bet didn't happen? I bet that an American soldier dropped into battle for the first time in his life didn't grab the half-torso of a dead comrade, and use the corpse as a shield in one hand while he mowed down Japanese troops with an assault rifle in the other.

It felt so out-of-place and inauthentic.",2018-01-28T21:26:30.000Z,0

I wish Desmond Doss was alive today  just so I could hug him.
Those 75 men who should have died, lived on, had family and their families had families so on, this man wasn't a hero, he was a saint. And don't forget that he wasn't the only one.
*SPOILER* During the movie, when he became friends with the soldier that kicked him, reminded me of a story my grandfather told me when I was a young boy. I asked him about war, wanting to know his story. He laughed and said ""even your father wasn't brave enough to ask that, but since you asked, heres some tips. He said don't make friends in war. I asked why? He said I had 2 best friends, we went through allot, and one morning we had to run up a beach. My friend on the left got his face shot off, and my friend on the right got shot down like a dog"" Then he said ""Don't be a hero"" Funny that, He was a war hero.
Those words stuck with me forever. Love you granddad. Lost but never forgotten.
He only got shot once, and that was by his own man, shot on the back capturing a village in france, He crawled onto a road and a medic drove past, the medic got out, and refused to help him, shortly later another medic came, and drove him 2 the hospital close to the village they we're capturing. after he had healed, he went to the pub of the village they had just captured and seen the medic who left him and he took his pistol out and almost shot him had it not been for another man pushing his hand up. He never slept properly, I remember hearing his screams in his sleep. I never knew what he went through because allot of it he never said, but who would? Just watching this is a small eye opener.

Hacksaw ridge is a great film, not the best war film though as it did have that Hollywood touch to it for example the cliff wasn’t as dramatic as it actually was or is. It is a great film though and the history behind it is brutal but beautiful. Lots of people do think that saving private Ryan is the best war film ever. No. The first 15 mins are the best I have ever seen, but the rest of the film just loses it for me. No war film is perfect, hacksaw ridge is a great film but not perfect. A perfect world War 1/2 film for me would be one that is historically perfect, visually perfect and a story that most normal people have never heard of before. Also no dramatic shots, so the only time you can see the opposing solider is when the main characters can. You also can only see just over the trench. Also no disrespect but I am tried of American solider movies, a British or French or even a german army perspective would be more fresh. Maybe even have two perspectives from a allied and axis view. I am trying to create a discussion from people who know there stuff. This was a fantastic film and Desmond was a hero that we all should look up to.",2017-12-14T23:04:51.000Z,2

The Jew walked out of the cell with me and we shared a room and he treated me.  So don't hate Jews. Its Judaism that separates us from them and so hate Judaism.,2017-12-02T02:43:37.000Z,0

Vince Vaughn was a bad fit he tears into people but he needs to stick to upbeat comedies. No way he can pull off military acting.  The matrix guy who says Mr Anderson seemed like he didn't even want to act in this crap film.  "" TRYING TOO HARD""  battle scenes on the same set over and over just to try to wheel in the people who just want to see gore over and over. Man what a fucking let down of a movie.

I'm a Christian, but lately I've been in a fairly rough time, and I haven't been feeling God there the whole time. I KNOW  He's always there, whether you can feel Him right next to you or not. I guess I've just been avoiding Him and not trusting. He's been telling me to come back, but I needed a bit of motivation. I had tried one night this week, but I just wasn't feeling it. This movie was exactly the kind of encouragement I needed. God helped me. He brought me back and showed me the way. The movie was about trusting God, especially through the hardest times.

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"This was a really good war movie, and an incredible true story. The fact that this man saved so many lives without firing a single bullet, astonishes me. For those who thought that this movie glorified violence in war, it does not. It really shows the brutal realisticness of how horrifying war is. Also, the acting in the movie is really good, but nothing spectacular. Vince Vaughn did surprise me though. I had no idea he was in this movie, because I didn't watch the trailer before I saw the movie. He was funny at times, but it was nice to see his serious, dramatic side that he hasn't shown in a long while. All in all, I give this movie 7.7/10 stars. 🎬🎥💥🔫🔫💣💉💊",2017-06-30T02:58:45.000Z,1

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,Decent movie. Andrew Garfield did a very good job. My only complaints were the level of gore (akin to horror films) and the length of the battle scenes. We get it wars are violent and bloody! I am glad that they didn't stereotype the Japanese soldiers or made them cartoonishly evil. The scene where Doss provides medical assistance to a Japanese soldier was excellent as it portrayed how much Doss valued *human* life regardless of what side they were on.,2017-05-30T03:42:52.000Z,99

I was shockend to hear that, but they will not succeed as long as I life. I will never bow for the ones who destroy me. Respect myself is the only thing I have left, to only thing to go on in life.

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"There is some weird stuff about this guys story. When he fas fastening the net to the ridge which was constantly being hailed with gunfire, the other soldiers remember there was no gunfire at all while Doss was up there which was VERY odd.
One Japanese survivor recognized Doss when His story started to go around and attests he remembers him well because every time he had this man (Doss) in his sight and pulled the trigger - his gun jammed. Also, Doss managed 75 men over about 12 hours - equaling about one man every 10 minutes which sounds humanly impossible. One soldier remembers Doss coming back carrying TWO men - one with each arm - and Doss was not a muscular guy! This is one weird story...",2017-03-25T06:03:17.000Z,1

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"Well in contrary to most peope here I do not think this movie was a masterpiece, neither is it one of the ""best films ever made"" nor does it deserve an Oscar. While Desmond Doss´ story is indeed a quiet unique and moving one and the main actor delivers a great performance, the rest of the movie just represents the pale generic American war movie you´ve seen a dozen times already + a portion of Gibson´s beloved violence. I have to shake my head when I hear people here telling ""woah the war scenes were sooo real"" which is a dilletantic statement just because visual violence plays a big role. Gibson just created a over-the-top point blank gore fest with gibs flying everywhere around and effects ala Michael Bay instead to potray the true horror of war on a more deep level and perhaps also for both sides (how Refreshing would that be!). Also makes the movie from a military tactical/strategical viewpoint absolutely zero sense, which is especially true for the Japanese side. And eventually - like in your typical America´s hero war movie - you of course have a total dehumanizing and demonization of the enemy - the Japanese who are potrayed like blood-lusting animals constantly busy to do blatant and nasty stuff just in order to serve as a vehicle for American heroic deeds.

If you´ve felt also unsatisfied after watching this movie but are looking for a great movie about the Pacific theatre I´ll recommend you to watch Letters from Iwo Jima which does a great job on the potrayal of good and evil on both sides in war and also The Thin Red Line which is famous not just for its cinematography and psychological aspect but also for the ""Battle for Hill 210"" the first combat scene in the movie which is one of the most realistic war scenes ever created in film.",2017-03-17T23:38:46.000Z,2

Sure, the story is incredible, but so many things in this film are just flat-out unrealistic and bad. All the battle sequences, the way the Japanese are portrayed and the forced romance combined with shitty and forgettable characters really brought it down for me. Sorry but you can't hold half a mans corpse in one hand and mow down 20 soldiers with a fully loaded BAR in the other, like what the fuck was I watching Rambo?

Sorry I like the story and the exploration on religious themes, but it was littered  with tons of inaccuracies that break the immersion, it reminded me a lot of ""The Patriot"" which completely shit on the British and making them look very unrealistic, again, propaganda at best.",2017-02-27T04:18:32.000Z,0

Most of the kid I met didn't join to kill or went their to become a war machine. Some of them came to pay for college, some of them came to pay of debt and mostly to have a good career in future like mechanical engineer, police officer or doctor etc. Sadly a lot of them will transfer to war zone and die for political bullshit. In my opinion the American economic system sometimes force us to join the military, that's why we need free college system for everybody so that we can achieve our dream jobs by getting necessary skills. In term of security government should only use military for national defense and stop giving money to foreign nations.",2017-02-24T07:55:28.000Z,0

I was a bit apprehensive of the casting of everyones favourite geek Andrew Garfield in the lead role-but to no avail-Garfield gives an Oscar winning performance taking us through every emotion possible. It takes a while till we get to the battle scenes-but that's essential for us to get to know and feel for the characters.The battle scenes when they hit are like a gore-fest horror movie and are expertly staged. A tremendous uplifting and inspirational movie which is not to be missed.,2017-01-23T14:56:57.000Z,1

A battlefield medic's position during the days of WWII was an illusion, giving the circumstances their instructions were to treat the minor injuries that are not life threatening, the other half of the majority who were doomed were given morphine to ease their sufferings and let them fade away painlessly. That is what the main purpose of the battlefield medic was, to help to unburden dying soldiers from pain and help them die in peace instead in agony, that was the whole purpose of the battlefield medics during WWII warfare, not to cure the dying but to relieve. There were no choppers that can fly to the battlefield take the wounded and fatally shot to the military tent base hospital for treatment, no sir, there was no such luxury available back then. The main character is blind about so many things. It doesn't matter what you gonna do when you're sent in the shit, priest, medic, photo-journalist that covers the war, you'll need to fire a weapon in basic camp to wake up your self instinct for survival and defend yourself.  He should have become a battlefield priest if he's so religious, yes, those positions existed in the army back in the WWII days, not sure about now. Basically the battlefield priest is suppose to read your prayers or listen to you praying while you're dying so you can make peace with god.",2017-01-19T01:12:35.000Z,0

If you have seen this movie, then I know you understand the sheer hell these men endured in an effort to combat an evil empire. The graphic nature of this film will shake you to the core. In the first ten minutes of actual on screen warfare you will experience a fear you have never felt before. Hacksaw ridge is a place no man should be forced to enter. It is kill zone of the like which no Hollywood bullshit entity has dared trespass on film. Because it makes them and their audience uncomfortable. Because it shows the real darkness of our world. It took a real hero to lead us through that hell. And it took a recovering alcoholic to bring those demons to light, because he wasn't afraid to direct a movie that inspired and terrified and shocked the world with its own beauty and brutality.

1) After being initially wounded, as seen in the movie, Doss was loaded onto a stretcher.  However, he rolled off it to treat another soldier.  Another wounded man was put on the stretcher.  Then Doss took a sniper's bullet that shattered his arm.  He splinted it and spent the next few hours getting himself off the field.
2) As to the lost Bible, Doss first realized it missing when aboard ship.  Word was sent to his unit of the loss and they searched throughout their battlefield before finding it.",2016-11-22T02:23:08.000Z,0

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"I've seen ""Hacksaw Ridge"" and it was very inspirationally. I'm glad director, Mel Gibson come back for his directorial chair and he done a fantastic job for making an epic WWII film. Andrew Garfield did a fantastic job for portraying as Desmond Doss. A caring veteran who doesn't believe guns and his purpose is to safe many soldiers which takes place in Japan. His performance was very intense and maybe, he could be position in the Oscars, but only if they decision because he done amazing job. Not as much of being a weak superhero character in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but in the good position which I'll be in the next future films. The entire battleground sequence is pretty bloody and reminds like another epic mature war sequence like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and our main character focuses his job to save many soldiers as he can. This film is very brilliant and I'm glad I wasn't that much hyped and it takes patience without these moron commenters and critics alike. But, I only stood watching this film and one of the best films of 2016.

he was a Christian all the way through and refused to kill anyone. he saved 75 of his comrades from danger.
Mathew 26:50

…50“Friend,” Jesus replied, “do what you came for.” Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested Him.

…51At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear. 52“Put your sword back in its place, Jesus said to him. “For all who draw the sword will die by the sword. 53Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?…",2016-11-19T10:52:56.000Z,8

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"Excruciating,  brutal, dark, intense, gripping, but also well thought out and breathtaking this movie shows why we need Mel Gibson as director today. This film doesn't hold grudges, it is hardcore in your face brutality, but he wanted to show all horrors and pain these conflicts bring and boy did he succeeded in that.
Everything is worth of admiration here. Phenomenal performances, especially Hugo Weaving who was on fire in this and astonishing Andrew Garfield, great directing, visual storytelling, awesome special effects and huge props to sound mixers and sound editors because they've done magnificent job in transporting us into the heart of the battle. It is sometimes tough film to sit through, but not without well paced humour, sense of catharsis and spirituality. 
If there are gripes about the film it is that some aspects were little bit cliche, especially romance part and some parts of the battle felt exaggerated to pump that american patriotism. In the end Hacksaw Ridge is not recruitment propaganda, it doesn't try to indoctrinate you to become adventist or shove some crazy ideas into your mind. It is just inspirational, full of hope and strong spirit that always overcomes the depression and that place when people are at their lowest. 4,5/5",2016-11-15T15:21:34.000Z,25

But I can tell you that I was very impressed with the story line, well worth your money. Good for date night with the lady. Go watch it!!",2016-11-14T18:42:25.000Z,8

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"In honour of remembrance day, I went and watched ""Hacksaw Ridge"" at the theatre Friday night with some friends. 

I thought it was going to be good, but that's an understatement; 

WOW what a movie!

It's my 2nd favourite movie of the year hands down, and so fitting for what's going on in our world today.

There are so many levels to it that I was able to connect with and apply to my own life which I seem to do from any thing I watch or read these days. 

With never having served in the Canadian military, I truly can never fully understand or appreciate what men and woman have to go thru in war. I have the utmost respect for any human willing to lay their life on the line for their country and communities, military/police/fire fighters etc. 

Even though there are many things that greatly saddens me within these institutions, especially the taking of human life, as I believe all life is precious; no one deserves to have their life taken too soon. I do believe in justice and I believe the best system we can have here for that, is some type of prison system where the person has lost their freedom to do what they want. Maybe for more severe crimes more sever prisons....Siberia/The Arctic spring to mind. haha

But it saddens me that so many people will disrespect and burn their countries flag without having a healthy perspective of what their fellow countrymen go thru in trying to serve and protect the best way they know how, even if it is misguided at times. Sure we got good and bad soldiers, cops etc, but we should never blame all for evil of some. There is a reason the divorce rate is the highest amongst marriages that involve those who server in military or some form of police. The trauma and things they have to see, do and go thru, it can easily break your mind/heart. In the USA, 20-22 vets commit suicide every day, so these are serious issues.

We are a broken world filled with angry people and thats what we see and feel throughout history. And you especially see that anger in war and where those who are supposed to serve and protect you are the very ones who are hurting and abusing you. But like the movie illustrates, you can coward and blame others or you can do your best to fight for whats right, even when you feel the whole world is against you.

What is the answer to all that? 

For me it's walking in my faith, and that was one of the most amazing theme's of Hacksaw Ridge. How no matter the obstacle, how serious, life and death the situation was, he relied on his faith and it got him threw it; even though sometimes it wasn't till the last second! He didn't blame others for the problems of the world, he just wanted to serve and save lives the best way he knew how. 

He lead by example even though he took the beatings the world threw at him from his dad, his own military, to the Japanese, all who wanted to hurt him and even kill him. By leading by example, others wanted to now come up to his level instead of him coming down to theirs. You see this near the end of the movie in the most amazing way.

Spoiler alert...so dont read any further if you are going to go see it, but to see his fellow soldiers wait on going up the ridge for the next assault, because they saw the protection and blessing that God had on his life, they wanted his prayers because it was a miracle what he did the night before!

Before that day, they had assault after assault and failed miserably, with endless dead bodies and a demoralized people. After his prayers, well the American army finally took Hacksaw Ridge. It reminds so much of the old Testament and when God walked with Israel and they succeeded in their battles and when they didn't, their enemies won the battle. 

James 5:16...... and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.

One person can always make a difference, and one person walking with God can change the world! 

By his faith, he walked the walk, loved and served and what happened......GOD SHOWED UP!

GO WATCH THE MOVIE, honour our vets and get some perspective on what God can do when you put your faith in His ways instead of mans ways.

Especially loved the moment of decision at the top of Hacksaw Ridge where he's praying about what to do next and the scenes that follow that. Though I found the scenes of war confronting, I later felt that they were important for knowing not only what soldiers go through and why so many struggle with PTSD afterwards, but also for knowing what Desmond was facing when he made the decision that he did that later brought him his Medal of Honour.

The military may seem to be about man's inhumanity to man, ""homo homini lupus"", ""man is a wolf to man"", as the ancient Romans put it in latin, but ultimately, the military is about man's humanity to man.  Ask the old GI's of WWII how it was when they, in later years, as tourists, met the old German soldiers, against whom they had fought.  Under those circumstances, it is more likely to be tears that are exchanged than bullets.  Ultimately, we do have our humanity.  Even soldiers and sailors.",2016-11-11T23:52:06.000Z,4

I love these types of war movies that make light of the variety of heroism during war other than all the killing and horrors people commit. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of the real hero is astonishing, let alone Mel Gibson's portrayal of how ugly war is. 5 star from me.


Top 5 in my favorite war movies. 
1. Saving Privet Ryan
2. War Horse 
3. Hacksaw Ridge

I can't understand the reviews it's getting. Nothing wrong with the reglious message or Mel Gibson himself. 
Just really terrible acting and horrible effects. Also very stupid moments in the film that were just so...random and out of place.

I was expecting religion to be theme. I was totally ok with that. I was not expecting religion being shoved down my throat at literally every 5 minutes or less. ""Bible. Lord. Jesus. Pray. Pray. Pray. Bible. Bible"". You could make a drinking game and get wasted in the first 10-15 minutes.

2 hours in three words: god, blood, and gore. It's well filmed and all, and there is a pretty good message, but it has too much propaganda covering it. The propaganda ruined the movie for me. Right now I am thinking ""This movie's message wasn't about religion"", but it's very hard to see that. This movie is made for religious people and to get admiration and viewers. Period.

I'm waiting for my 10:30 show (730 sold out 4 hours before) and I'm sitting there blazed outta my mind with my Dasani water and pretzel bites with cheese. Then the 730 people come out and it's mostly elderly folks. They were so astonished and so hype about this movie, saying it was fantastic , unbelievable etc. and it just warmed my heart. They know what the WW2 war meant to them, same way when younger guys like me watch united 93 or the hurt locker. Just seeing that the movie made them so happy , was a really cool moment.

""get going private private 
parts"" everything he said was funny but serious as well. i would like to see him in more roles like this. the story was amazing, the acting was great and the whole thing of standing up for what you believe in was great. the only reason i do not give this movie a higher rating is because they turned it into a war film not a film about desmond. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do or  rating 3/5",2016-11-09T06:33:54.000Z,0

Christ didn't teach followers to do what movies shows them doing; one example, recent Tarzan movie shows a christian as a meanest killing everything villain. What gives?
Finally, a movie that shows a person (real person) who acts according to Christ's teachings. And it is this teaching, and consequent actions that make things better. Consider a Japanese dude, who was treated by Desmond. If I was him, I would change sides; I don't need a country that supports Nazi, I want country that supports Christianity (not the USA today though :o(",2016-11-08T18:39:22.000Z,1

So I went I didn't think I was going to like it (war movies aren't my thing) I just went for the points. But I ended up loving this movie. I would absolutely recommend. It is a very suspenseful movie I was shaking the whole time during the war scenes because it is scary and hard to think of this as something that did actually happen.

This is without a doubt, one of the best, most moving pieces I've seen in years.
It took my breath away, and only reinforced my belief that Mel Gibson is, and always will be, one of the best actors and directors on the planet. 
It also made me proud to be a follower of Christs teachings, and even though I'm far from grace, it'll only serve to push me to be a better human being.

What other name could you call somebody who is in a position to see and prevent every rape, murder, abuse and war on the planet, but doesn't do anything but stand/exist there and look?
If a human being did that, they would be called an uncaring monster, but when the one ignoring all of the pain is given the title of the ultimate moral being and source of love, it somehow gets away with that same exact behaviour. 

How is that righteous and moral? 

If religion is not true and its just us humans, at least it's just us who are being heroes and monsters who can try their best and fail,  but don't have to be judged by someone who gets away with being the worst uncaring and unhelpful monster ever but would judge someone to eternal torture for loving someone of their own gender...

I myself am a Christian, and Jesus and the Apostles were not opposed to ""tools"" that may have been used to defend yourself. One verse in particular, I believe from 2 Corinthians (You may need to fact check me on the correct reference) states, ""For the weapons of our warfare our not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses."" Thus, saying that weapons actually are not a sin to wield. Another well known quote by Jesus is ""Let he who has no sword, sell his own cloak to buy one.""",2016-11-02T03:04:12.000Z,0

America  stood up against the Nazis and Japanese who were truly comitting evil acts. My half brother has a great uncle who faught the japanese and he had found nuns who were killed as bayonet practice. I love hearing stories of how America stood up for what was right. It is imprtant to stand up for morality and Christianity. I do not believe the man was right in not using a rifle. God had his people destroy civilizations of pure evil. This can remind people of what America truly is, and what it should be. It is 9 days before the election, so the world is about to change a lot very soon.

If he just missed his shots during the war, it wouldn't have made a difference. But no, instead of just being one of the men, he has to get his microdick out and challenge everyone to measure up. All he had to do is not shoot when he should. Why didn't he just become a Hospital Corpsman? They're suppose to be non-combatants. They would had trained him how to heal the injured, AND save them. Furthermore, he could assist the other side too since he's technically a non-combatant.

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,I did a report on Desmond Doss in middle school. Not only did Doss become one of the 464 Medal of Honor recipients of World War II but became the first conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honor. People think that a hero may be someone that storms into a battlefield firing a rifle at anyone that's firing at their side of the line. Yet people forget the other side of heroic actions. Doss made a stand not only in the war against opposing forces but back home when he fought to defend his religion. I certainly plan on seeing this movie when it comes out.,2016-10-22T21:16:53.000Z,10

And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they owed to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers, that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies.
And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed.
 Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion.

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,I have mixed feelings about this movie. The man definitely deserves high honors and respect for his service and saving the wounded but to claim that he has some form of moral superiority over his fellow soldiers who used weapons to win the war is something I flat out disagree with. The soldiers who fought to win the war saved a nation and to say that he spent his time saving life and they didn't is like spitting on their graves. You can honor this man without undermining their service.,2016-10-19T15:21:11.000Z,6

But people come on STOP with tying everything to starting controversy. Religion is supposed to be a private intimate thing not yelled at by others, a lot of people say they respect religions but many don't. God is in your head/heart if he/she helps you through the day awesome, but others like myself aren't religious and get along just fine. Stop fighting about it. I really do like the fact that he was anti gun, major props to him. I don't think I'd be as strong as him in that regard.

Because if you always create movies about how ALL Germans were bad guys and ALL other countries fighting them were stupid, with only the Americans saving the world then you must be that kind of stupid bastard and people love these movies but basing their historical knowledge to them will do no good to our modern era world. 

Of course such movies are pure enjoyment, with a lot of action, good effects and characters but seriously stop amassing such films America. Instead, cast these good actors in way more brutal films showing a more humane aspect of the world from both the sides of the Axis and the Allies. Show the people enjoying movies that war is a wrongdoing at first, then that it becomes a necessary evil once both sides have violent people leading them to conflict. 

This imaginary jewish god did shit during the war of course but I am gonna enjoy this movie since this man did something remarkable. Although if a lot of people did the same remarkable thing then the war would be over with the Allies losing.",2016-10-14T15:13:00.000Z,0

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"I have known about this real character for some time. When I first came across his story, I decided to do research in order to find out if he really existed and if what I had initially heard had any merit in fact. What I discovered exceeded the initial account about his life I had heard. His whole life was a walking contradiction to the world in which he lived. This man's character and actions as a whole is legendary in the most positive sense of the word. How he was able to live in this world and make it to the end of a long life span is really remarkable because of how he demonstrated through daily action what he said he believed. It is curious how his story is only really known to a specific community of people in our world. This movie appears to finally bring his miraculous life and integrity to a greater audience. It is incongruous that his story is being revealed on a big stage in our society and culture at this distressing time in our country and world. However, his life as he lived it was incongruous with the world and time in which he was living.  We need more people to imitate this man's life.

This trailer appears to get the facts right as far as it can in a trailer. In order to fully appreciate this movie and understand the nuances I saw in the trailer and therefore believe will be in the movie, I suggest you web search Desmond T. Doss. I think that by learning everything you can about him will greatly enhance your experience as you watch the movie. If you don't, I think the amazing things you hear and see in the movie will cause you to greatly question the credibility of this being a true story.  Many comments I read make assumptions from this trailer that are fact incorrect.

I think the quality of this trailer really speaks for itself. It shows great cinematography, a good script, good acting, and potentially a well edited story line. I am not a member of the specific community from which this man came. However, I strive to be his brother in the community in which I believe he is a great example. I intentionally attempt not to reveal to much about Desmond T. Doss. I believe he is a man that deserves being discovered by each individual. If you are interested in being blessed by getting as close as you can to someone of great integrity and stability in this time of chaos and division, than he is worth putting in the time of researching him and seeing this movie.

Also, this story is not about Mel Gibson.  If you don't want to support or be connected to another human who you don't agree with, try disconnecting.  To be clear of my point, it is not possible to do.",2016-09-27T09:48:50.000Z,1

So why is this imaginary guy so fucking special?! Ohhh, he's American that's why so he's got to be special, right? I don't hate Americans it's just their fucking annoying stupidity and media control is all. One of my best mates is an American as far as an American goes back in the history of the united states and he shares my opnion. He ain't so damn blind and fooled by the media.
I do hope though that Mel Gibson wins the Oscar to piss off Hollywood! He's one of my favourite!",2016-09-16T16:54:12.000Z,0

Did he just slap and karate kick a grenade, have it blow up just feet away from him, and he is most likely going to be okay??  I guess they forgot this was based on a true story.  lol
This looks pretty cool.  Though something seems off.  I mean not everyone that fought for our country was of the same skin color.  And no, I am not just talking about a specific group.  There were more than just black and white people that fought for this country.  That's a bit of a downside that it's trying to be written that way in the movie. Though I think Mel Gibson directed it, so it is not a big surprise that is so. Given some of the racist things he has said, it is clear he is not the best person in the world.  Though, despite this, the movie still looks alright.",2016-09-16T09:45:11.000Z,5

He was very healthy for his age and walked around well. He told me to shake his hand and I was afraid I would hurt it so I barely gave him a handshake, he told me to give him a real handshake not like a wet noodle. He would tell stories about the Navajo code breakers, guys that were teenagers in the war. He was strict, but kind and wise. I'm saddened by his passing this year. He was born in 1914 or 1915 and lived a long life. I've met his son also, a very nice man that has played drums for The Who and many other bands. He also became a pastor.",2016-09-10T15:02:58.000Z,0

Believe me when conscientious objectors used the Bible to justify killing. The Bible strongly emphasied and  meant ""never murder"". NO IF'S OR BUTS. Killing can become any of us when truly necessary. 
NEVER HIDE BEHIND SCRIPTURE to support weakness.

Some American Civil War movies? Or even some French civil war movies? Also, why does every WW2 movie have to feature in a main spot, someone with a VERY thick American accent from the south or wherever. And if they have to have one, why not cast someone from that region. Same with Irish people in American movies. Just cast a fucking Irish actor instead of having someone do a terrile version of one. .. Do you know WHY France had so many civil wars though? So they could win one every now and then",2016-08-12T17:35:02.000Z,3

DO NOT JUDGE THEM,
Because - sometimes - beneath of those “doing” & “working” exist the work of a human being that is way beyond the comprehension of any man or woman on this planet.

JUST WISH THEM WELL,

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"It occurred to me that the negative comments are completely expected. 

These people only saw the trailer and drew some legitimates observations and concerns. However, I invite all the critics to read more into the real Desmond T Doss, the humble, unassuming man who just wanted to serve while holding dear to his faith at all cost. It's fascinating that some of the negative comments reflect the actual cynicism Doss' fellow soldiers and superiors showed towards him as well. They threw boots at him in the barracks, shamed him, called him cowards, made him clean the latrine, even tried to kick him out and threatened to kill him! When those very same men nominated Doss for nothing less than the Medal of Honor, and when surviving WWII MOH recipients appointed Doss to represent them in 1962 at the White House, their loathing had turned to respect for the man beyond reproach....and you would discover a man of biblical proportions. 

""But the Lord hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and the Lord hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things.""
""Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.""

I, for one, am humbled and am truly privileged to have discovered Desmond Doss. All my complains, whining, hurt feelings, and vindictiveness are suddenly nonsensical. I can't help but being inspired to be a better, truer person.  I wished I had met him. He had led a quiet life in a town next to mine until his passing in March 23, 2006. A true soldier, and a saint.",2016-08-06T05:25:21.000Z,1

The reason Doss was able to save so many lives without getting hit himself on that escarpment is because  GOD let him be a witness to the POWER OF GOD, to show the world what GOD could do with someone who kept HIS LAW.  There is a deep moral message behind this story.  I can only PRAY that Mel Gibson and all those involved with the making of this movie picked up on this and that this movie could be used by GOD to bring people that made it or will see it to, or closer to, JESUS.  JESUS tasted the 2nd death for all of us so we could spend eternity with HIM.  HE LOVES us that much.",2016-08-05T03:12:03.000Z,0

(Sarcastic Trigger Warning: This post acknowledges that the world is a violent place)

Something people in today's society do not understand is that people must die for others to live. Though we can acknowledge that such a figure as ""Pvt. Doss"" is incredibly heroic and should be commended for their valor, this is not a message or a goal for all of our soldiers. This case study is not widely applicable to the vast majority of soldiers, especially those whose military occupational specialties are in combat arms. 

There are a number of military occupational specialties that allow individuals to serve without firing a shot. Except for the Marine Corps, which expects all of its service members to function in the capacity of a rifleman and their own specific MOS, every branch of the military offers non-combat roles that allow individuals to serve their country without killing anyone.

This film is not necessarily a social justice warrior piece of propaganda. Such a story is incredibly moving and can certainly serve to display the struggles of our brave servicemen. That said, if it overly brutalizes or crudely displays the personalities and actions of the soldiers, then it probably is. But don't make assumptions.

The reason I'm writing this is because I don't want a bunch of idealists in our military. With Trump or Clinton at the helm, you should expect to get your hands dirty if you're in combat arms. While we can afford a Pvt. Doss here and there, an army of pacifists has never won a war. And to the special snowflakes reading this comment: MLK and Gandhi didn't fight wars. They had struggles, but there was no concentrated military effort seeking to capture, kill, or destroy them. 

That said, I hope this film isn't turned into SJW bullshit and I also hope that not too many soldiers and conservatives dismiss this movie before they see it. Peace out.(see what I did there?)",2016-08-05T02:44:29.000Z,1

A good story ,but Hollywood never  honors our warriors unless it is underlines the tragedy of war.  Instead of recognizing peace is mythical and our military and armed police force is more necessary today than ever because of the ridiculous positions people take on peace that is more like believing in Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny and better serves our enemies domestic and foreign.  There aren't enough waste paper baskets.  And Mel Gibson he had to make this film, his own inability and failures at anger management and anti semitism and his career as a king of film  violence in ""Lethal Weapon"" heavy gun violence, required he remold his image, this film should do it.

This movie lionizes his ""courage"" to be a coward. I would have kicked him in the face, too. I don't want a teammate who would rather watch me be run through by a katana on the battlefield than pick up a weapon to defend me. This man and men like him could never have defeated Nazi Germany. It took guts, grit, as the determination to do the ugly and unpleasant violent work of stopping evil by force. His immoral attitude is to tolerate evil. I don't ever want to kill anyone, either,
but I'm willing to do things I don't want
to do to stop great evils like mass murder. I miss old-fashioned American values. Hollywood movies and TV today glamorize being a selfish wimp.",2016-08-02T08:33:17.000Z,1

He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged escarpment 400 feet high. As our troops gained the summit, a heavy concentration of artillery, mortar and machinegun fire crashed into them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire-swept area with the many stricken, carrying all 75 casualties one-by-one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a rope-supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands. On May 2, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and 2 days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades to within eight yards of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety. On May 5, he unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer. He applied bandages, moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small arms fire and, while artillery and mortar shells fell close by, painstakingly administered plasma. Later that day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a cave, Pfc. Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the enemy position, rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while continually exposed to enemy fire. On May 21, in a night attack on high ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was again struck, by a sniper bullet while being carried off the field by a comrade, this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station. Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Doss saved the lives of many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of duty.",2016-08-01T06:14:05.000Z,1

The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to
DOSS, DESMOND T.
Rank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Medical Detachment, 
307th Infantry, 77th Infantry Division. Place and date: Near Urasoe 
Mura, Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands, 29 April-21 May 1945. Entered service at:
 Lynchburg, Va. Birth: Lynchburg, Va. G.O. No.: 97, 1 November 1945. 
Citation:
 He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged 
escarpment 400 feet high As our troops gained the summit, a heavy 
concentration of artillery, mortar and machinegun fire crashed into 
them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others 
back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire-swept 
area with the many stricken, carrying them 1 by 1 to the edge of the 
escarpment and there lowering them on a rope-supported litter down the 
face of a cliff to friendly hands. On 2 May, he exposed himself to heavy
 rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards forward of 
the lines on the same escarpment; and 2 days later he treated 4 men who 
had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing 
through a shower of grenades to within 8 yards of enemy forces in a 
cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 
separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety. On 5 May, he 
unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an 
artillery officer. He applied bandages, moved his patient to a spot that
 offered protection from small arms fire and, while artillery and mortar
 shells fell close by, painstakingly administered plasma. Later that 
day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a cave, Pfc. 
Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the enemy position,
 rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while continually 
exposed to enemy fire. On 21 May, in a night attack on high ground near 
Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company 
took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for 
an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was 
himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade. 
Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own 
injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and 
started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank 
attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, 
crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first 
attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was 
again struck, this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm. With 
magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a 
splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station.
 Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the 
face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Doss saved the lives of 
many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry 
Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of 
duty.",2016-07-31T16:47:23.000Z,1

Obama style - Ukrainians should fight for their freedom and lives but without lethal weapons (jerk). I've read the memories of young soviet Jew, who joint the partisans in Bryansk region during WW2. Astonishing story, once he was caught by polizai (Russians who supported Germans) they where too busy, the weather was bad (blizzard) so they shoot him in the back, but the wound was light. In few moths he met those polizai in convoy ambushed. He said that it was surprisingly easy (for 16 year boy) how quickly and easy he killed 4 armed men with dagger jumping in their wagon from the roof of the barn. During breaking from encirclement by regular German units. his detachment was forced to cross the road - 100 m of open place close to German  positions. 2 machine guns provided covering fire taking all enemy fire without any cover - 12 machine gunners where killed one after one, he was second in the line to replace dead gunners when convoy crossed the road.

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"This movie is obviously fits the liberal agenda of the hero who didn't carry a gun and saved all the wounded but the men who fought with guns are every bit as brave. My gradfather was a WW2 veteran who made it out alive, a hero, and he and the other gun toting members of the US military. He fought in the battles of Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and countless other islands that came before en route to our victory over Japan. No doubt this man deserves every bit of respect and all of the honors for what he did and believed but don't forget the men who actually did the fighting and treat them like they were bullies and bad guys like this trailer portrays. Fuck a Mel Gibson too. He's been a gun toting ""bad boy"" his whole career. Now he wants to do liberal propaganda for an election year?",2016-07-31T07:52:55.000Z,2

Doss receiving the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman


Citation
 

He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged escarpment 400 feet high. As our troops gained the summit, a heavy concentration of artillery, mortar and machinegun
 fire crashed into them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and 
driving the others back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in
 the fire-swept area with the many stricken, carrying all 75 casualties 
one-by-one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a 
rope-supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands. On May
 2, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a 
wounded man 200 yards forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and 2
 days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a 
strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades
 to within eight yards of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he 
dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire 
to evacuate them to safety. On May 5, he unhesitatingly braved enemy 
shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer. He applied 
bandages, moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small
 arms fire and, while artillery and mortar shells fell close by, 
painstakingly administered plasma.
 Later that day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a 
cave, Pfc. Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the 
enemy position, rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while 
continually exposed to enemy fire. On May 21, in a night attack on high 
ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of 
his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be 
mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured 
until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a
 grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his 
own injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank
 attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, 
crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first 
attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was 
again struck, by a sniper bullet while being carried off the field by a 
comrade, this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint
 and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station. 
Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the 
face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Doss saved the lives of 
many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry 
Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of 
duty.",2016-07-30T02:40:22.000Z,2

He was a company aid man when the 1st Battalion assaulted a jagged escarpment 400 feet high. As our troops gained the summit, a heavy concentration of artillery, mortar and machine gun fire crashed into them, inflicting approximately 75 casualties and driving the others back. Pfc. Doss refused to seek cover and remained in the fire-swept area with the many stricken, carrying all 75 casualties one-by-one to the edge of the escarpment and there lowering them on a rope-supported litter down the face of a cliff to friendly hands. On May 2, he exposed himself to heavy rifle and mortar fire in rescuing a wounded man 200 yards forward of the lines on the same escarpment; and 2 days later he treated 4 men who had been cut down while assaulting a strongly defended cave, advancing through a shower of grenades to within eight yards of enemy forces in a cave's mouth, where he dressed his comrades' wounds before making 4 separate trips under fire to evacuate them to safety. On May 5, he unhesitatingly braved enemy shelling and small arms fire to assist an artillery officer. He applied bandages, moved his patient to a spot that offered protection from small arms fire and, while artillery and mortar shells fell close by, painstakingly administered plasma. Later that day, when an American was severely wounded by fire from a cave, Pfc. Doss crawled to him where he had fallen 25 feet from the enemy position, rendered aid, and carried him 100 yards to safety while continually exposed to enemy fire. On May 21, in a night attack on high ground near Shuri, he remained in exposed territory while the rest of his company took cover, fearlessly risking the chance that he would be mistaken for an infiltrating Japanese and giving aid to the injured until he was himself seriously wounded in the legs by the explosion of a grenade. Rather than call another aid man from cover, he cared for his own injuries and waited 5 hours before litter bearers reached him and started carrying him to cover. The trio was caught in an enemy tank attack and Pfc. Doss, seeing a more critically wounded man nearby, crawled off the litter; and directed the bearers to give their first attention to the other man. Awaiting the litter bearers' return, he was again struck, by a sniper bullet while being carried off the field by a comrade, this time suffering a compound fracture of 1 arm. With magnificent fortitude he bound a rifle stock to his shattered arm as a splint and then crawled 300 yards over rough terrain to the aid station. Through his outstanding bravery and unflinching determination in the face of desperately dangerous conditions Pfc. Doss saved the lives of many soldiers. His name became a symbol throughout the 77th Infantry Division for outstanding gallantry far above and beyond the call of duty. He also received the medal of honor.",2016-07-29T18:45:27.000Z,1

2016-07-28T12:59:49.000Z,s2-1hz1juBI,Hacksaw Ridge (2016) Official Trailer – “Believe” - Andrew Garfield,"Don't forget Hillary the same person who was responsible for Benghazi, and innocent American lives lost. Also consider she wasn't even in the position of commander in chief and still couldn't protect our fellow American. Read this first before making assumptions about Trump and how some people say, ""I don't trust Trump in office."" The hardcore facts are Hillary can not own up to her mistakes, she often blames others. For example emails being leaked, she blames them on Russia and China, when she dodges the point of what she says in those emails. When Benghazi happened a week later she decided to collapse and hit her head and not taking responsibility for her mistake not doing her job right. My second point that she says what the people want to hear. For example forcing insurance companies to make transsexual surgeries covered. Why waste money on things like that when some one has to pay a deposit in order for them to get a heart transplant. Stop wasting money on passing bills to get transsexual bathrooms and gay rights. That money can be used for our future generations education, job creation, road work, building public facilities which less fortunate people can use. Last point to make short. Why are we bringing terrorists in this country???I have traveled to majority of these middle eastern countries and they hate foreigners like us, they spit at us. They wont let us live in their country, why should they be allowed in ours? With Hillary another tragic day like 9/11 will occur. We need put national security first and build up our economy, and a president who wont be scared to tell the truth. The truth will hurt some, but its better to be hurt than dead.#trump2016",2016-07-29T15:11:49.000Z,0

(1) It's not a fictional story - go watch ""The Conscientious Objector"", a documentary featuring interviews of Desmond Doss' teammates and himself. He was a Seventh-day Adventist who firmly believed in keeping God's commandment ""Thou shalt not kill"".
(2) Desmond Doss actually did kick the grenade, so don't go thinking that scene in the trailer was just to make it more ""action-packed"".
(3) ""rescued 75 people single-handedly"" was just the officials giving an average number. His teammates said he saved about 100 people all by himself, but Desmond said ""it couldn't have been more than 50"" so they took the average (50+100)/2=75.
(4) Desmond Doss died in 2006.",2016-07-29T06:06:28.000Z,0

He only ever used a weapon to splint his leg or arm so that he could continue to rescue his fallen brothers after he himself was wounded.

Get off your lazy asses and do the work. (for those who do not know. reports say English actors and other non-american actors. Work the craft more. They study and perfect all aspects of acting And have a long resume before coming to Hollywood. The American actors just show up take a few classes at best, Then want to star in a major role at 21 years old.)  ---

CORRECTION: Andi Pati has brought it to my attention that Andrew Garfield was born in America.  He moved when he was 3 years old. And attended uk schools of drama. Come on. HES an ENGLISH ACTOR. You want specifics perhaps i need to be more clear.

but I told him, it may not be my duty but it was what I believed in.
I knew these men; they were my buddies, some had wives and children. 
If they were hurt, I wanted to be there to take care of them. 
And when someone got hit, the others would close in around me while I treated him, 
then we'd all go out together.""",2016-07-28T15:42:59.000Z,3
