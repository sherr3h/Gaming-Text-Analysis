Where it tells the story of where they came from before they where famous enough and when they got famous (8 mile, all eyes on me, etc.) also the ending nearly made me cry. Everything in that scene was perfectly executed to show what happened. Even the music was the perfect choice. It was a real tear jerker and I don't cry easily watching movies.

They use the guy who played Big in PACs film so why not the other way round? You though out of respect for PAC that top actors would wanna be in his film. Instead I new 4 people in it, the rest I couldn't recognise who was who until they said there names, I recognized suge cos he's a big man and PAC, that's it.

Much props to black movie director Benny Boom. Benny used to be a rap music video director. Demetrius Shipp did very good playing 2Pac Shakur. The black guy who played Suge Knight did a good job. He kinda looks like Suge. I also like the black woman who played 2Pac's mom Afeni. I wanna have sex with Katerina Graham who played Jada Pinkett. She's hot. I also like the cute lightskin black woman who had a small part as r&b music singer Faith Evans. I like the cute black woman who played music producer Quincy Jones daughter Kidada. She was Demetrius girlfriend. I like her hair and her body. She used to play on Charlie's Angels tv show. I don't know her name. I saw Jamal Woolard in the movie as dead music rapper Notorious Big. I liked him in Notorious movie. I also saw music rappers Maino, Edi Mean and Young Noble of the Outlawz in the movie. Edi Mean and Young Noble were 2Pac's friends. I see in one scene that Demetrius tried to leave Death Row records to start his record company. Suge Knight prevented him from leaving because he owed Death Row money. I knew that was gonna happen because Suge doesn't let his music artists leave his company unless they pay him the money they owe him LOL. That's probably how Snoop Dogg, Dogg Pound, Lady Of Rage and Dr Dre left Death Row. I know they didn't get outta their contracts without paying Suge money they owed him. I didn't like the black guy who played Suge in the movie trying to prevent Demetrius from leaving Death Row. Demetrius said that he had done 3 albums which is what he owed Death Row. But that still wasn't good enough for him to leave. So the black guy who played Suge started a distribution record deal called Death Row East so Demetrius could work with New York music rappers.",2017-07-03T18:20:03.000Z,0

I didn't like the ending because the last scene is of him getting shot and the police taking him out of the vehicle. There was no follow-up whatsoever, even though he died in the hospital 5-6 days later in reality. There should have been a scene of his girlfriend finding out he got shot, because in the movie, he chooses to go to the club with Suge, despite his girlfriend being worried about him. It made no sense to create that scene whatsoever, because that's the last time you see her in the movie. There isn't even a scene of her finding out he was shot in the first place. The movie should've had a hospital scene where family and Death Row members visited 2Pac while he was in a coma. I believe there's an interview with Snoop Dogg where he says he visited Pac in the hospital and started talking to him because he felt that he could hear him, even though he was out cold. This should have been in the movie. It would've been more emotional, and in my opinion, way better than just the screen going dark right after he gets capped. That's just my two cents though.

Other than the ending, which was mediocre at best I feel, the movie definitely is worth watching. I enjoyed it, and it gave me insight to how rich but tragic life was for a 90's rapper that just wanted to make a change.",2017-06-28T14:21:54.000Z,0

It didn't make it feel like it wasn't a movie. It felt like drama class. The actor who looks like Pac did a good job, but the script sucked. Where is his best friend? Where is the security guard that also was his friend?

They could have used much better material like 2Pac and Biggie beef. 2Pac wanting to run for politics.

They rushed this movie and squeezed everything into small portions which is stupid. The Snoop scene was little information. What happened to Dre? it was a clip less than a second. 

The beef with Biggie seemed too short. The beginning took too long on his mom. It just was too draining. They should have used the same clip from Biggies movie where its the opposite of that moivie. Show Biggie getting arrested.

This movie is not representing Pac correctly.

The film also never gives the audience the chance to let the conflicts, environments, and moods get established and sink in since most scenes, events, and conflicts that take place before 1995 last for about 1-2 minutes.

Not to mention that the raps included feel like they are there just to please the audience rather than having a significance for the story, and that's because their background and motivationd aren't explored properly.",2017-06-23T23:12:59.000Z,224

Instead of respecting ourselves, they thought us to kill our brothers, sell community destroying dope, and treat our women like trash.  It influenced an entire generation of youth to do it, and that's what we have today. 

Men like 2pac, Biggie, NWA, Too Short and Ice T were nothing more than sellouts and Judases who played the role for these crooked Zionists who wanted to wreck our communities and paint an image of thugs out of us.  And look at what the world calls us today...  I'm glad his movie is bombing.  He was no revolutionary or hero.  He was a traitor to our people.

I am grateful that the director/company behind this movie put the effort into making this movie knowing full well it might be a flop or a success.

Gangbanger or not, Tupac made good music, and the fact that he wrote a heartfelt and STRONG song about his undying love for his mother earns him my respect and MY MONEY for this movie ticket.

However both critics were out of Australia... I am NERVOUS about the All Eyez on Me as a film and I felt this way when I learned that Antoine Fuqua, the first Director tapped to direct, backed out of the project. Fuqua was also Afeni's choice to tell her son's story. For those who don't know Fuqua directed Training Day with Denzel Washington. Side note - Fuqua was going to do a movie about Monster Scott Kody and Kody wanted Tupac to play him.

I didn't understand then how much he has accomplished is just 25 years and thought that was a long time to live. Today I AM 25 as I write this and thinking back and knowing the significance of this man and acknowledging everything he has done is just 25 years is astonishing! Thank you Tupac Amaru Shakur.

TUPAC IS!! not was.. and ALWAYS will be!!
the number one rapper in the world!!
He inspires the masses in ways unknown
Through his unique style, lyrically unscathed
He's the king of rap & can't be overthrown
Many have tried, but nobody can take his place 
Their failed attempts are nothing but a disgrace
The transparency of conspiracies to end his life
All related to greed and unnecessary strife
Has shown itself useless in silencing a born leader
whose legacy only gets GREATER 
His heart felt in every word 
cut his enemies like a sword
He gets the most love in the industry
This caused jealousy and internal fury 
TUPAC is a prophet
bold & courageous,
with a giving spirit, yes at times, outrageous
His legend will continue to live on 
and though we will all carry on
He is who we will never forget
A true POET

His name is Tupac Amaru Shakur
They said he was gone but their words were premature
His message and spirit are very much present
A hero not for what he did, but for his intent
Hear whats written in his music
Truth in the form of a lyric
A man of influence, also a non-conformist
Faced with limited choices, became an opportunist
A true soldier known world wide as multi-dimensional
Offering and seeking love unconditional
With a style anything but common
His music remains an international phenomenon
He had the courage to reveal so many truths, no matter how painful
This is why his fans stay faithful
Tupac's wish to spark a change in the world came true
Just know that flame will continue
It is he who at one time said, we aren't ready to see a black president
That time came and went",2017-04-22T21:33:34.000Z,0

I feel that people need to understand that the whole east coast west coast feud was a big media thing and to show what was really¬†going behind the scenes from all¬†important/ critical¬†vantage points.¬†I mean yes people can do more research on the internet but¬†in this modern age what better way then to put it in a movie to inflict interest of a situation¬†to an audience, influencing them to go and do more of their own research. It was a big event just like the Rodney king trials, O.J. Simpson trials, L.A. Riots, Police brutality back in the 80s-90s, etc. 
I mean look at the show, ""American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson"", I was alive during that time yet I paid no attention to it but I heard about it and knew alittle about what it was, yet I never took interest in it until the show came out and when I started seeing how the show was a big deal on media, before I watched the show myself I did my research first and watched the whole trial on YouTube and watched the first movie that came out about O.J. Simpson and then I watched the show and saw the things that were happening behind the scenes that you didn't get to see in the news¬†unless you were actually there. Yes a few things were off in the show but the concept and idea and knowledge on the bit of American history was very educational to me and made me see things from a different light. That's why I feel they should make these movies for the younger generation.",2017-04-07T21:09:47.000Z,1
