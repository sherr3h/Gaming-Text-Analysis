I hope the movie is just as satisfying.  Having goosebumps because this is the first book in a long time that I read before it became a movie - ever since Harry Potter!

There are people who read, and there are people who unfortunately don't . For the latter, this is the only way Julian Barnes's story can get to them. It is a compliment for the author and a way for him to reach more people. I absolutely loved the book and read it twice. Unlike other readers I found it unsettling and memorable but   I am always happy to see cinema being inspired by great books and authors. They are, after all, two different arts.
