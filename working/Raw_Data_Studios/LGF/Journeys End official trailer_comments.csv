Two officers take the what could be the last few minutes of their life and talk about anything but the war. It was brilliant, and really hit a nerve. Wow! Sadly the film is just unwatchable the rest of the time, there is no sprite, no heart, no story. You are left waiting for the story to go somewhere but it ends up being 2 hours of officers eating, drinking and yelling at one another. The film did't end well as it basically preaches to you that war is pointless. A famous director said, ""If you want to preach, make a documentary"" And i agree, this film apart form that brilliant scene lacks a story. Everyone will dislike this review and challenge it, but at the end of the day not a single one of us would watch this film over and over again, its just an empty script. 6/10",2018-08-18T06:18:42.000Z,6

the ""masses""...Mark I male: 28 tons, female: 27 tons and a Daimler-Knight 6 cyl, 16 liter, with 105hp/78kW... 230 liters or 60 US gallons internal fuel and 3.7 mph max speed (6 km/h), but its good if you have always enough oil, tractors were used heavily in easy terrain by the French troops thanks to their oil supply as Central Power (like the Nazis in the next WW) had very very limited oil access, especially the high quality fuel for submarines and aircrafts^^ US private oil companies already during the war and after the war US car makers were the winners once again... 

before 100,000 bpd worldwide demand, after WW1 300,000 bpd and a large need for the new (mostly US) cars... and the fall of the Empire began, and the US were only waiting to become the new partner when the UK had to leave (like in Persia, as CIA did it they got a nice amount of the earlier Anglo-Persian Oil Company :D Saudi Arabian oil was US, Kuwait and Iraq were shared but with a large advantage for US and later I think the oil in Iraq was declared US only too?!

Oil was vital for wars for over 100 years :D 50,000 tanks and 50,000 (like the very good Fokker D.VII, produced until 1928 after the problems with variants for low and higher heights was fixed later an additional 1,000 were build for the winners over 10 years) aircrafts on the German side, 100,000 tractors, 250,000 cars (as used in 1914, they took all private taxis to transport troops to the front :D it worked as the speed for such small personal vehicle were much better and it was no long trip to the enemy troops) with empty fuel would have been quite useless because where to take the oil for them from :D

Be happy if you refill your vehicle next time you pay such a low price in the US :D Most Africans have to pay much more without help from the state for emergency diesel or so in the not so...poor... countries, while others in the Nigeria/Niger Delta area have no cash to help out even if they would like to :> petroleum lamps are still in heavy use there... oil oil oil oil oil",2018-03-25T15:18:54.000Z,0

2017-10-23T13:21:01.000Z,tLpyaLNfudY,Journey&#39;s End Trailer #1 (2018) | Movieclips Trailers,"Prelude¬†
Back in the days when everyone but a few wise souls expected the war to be over by Christmas, thousands of eager young men rushed to obey the call of Kitchener's pointing finger. They joined up from all walks of life and from all parts of the country, from Lancashire mill towns and remote Scottish villages, to universities and Inns of Court. The Somme battle was to be their proving ground, this was what they had joined for and trained for.
This was to be the battle which broke the tedium of trench warfare and opened the way for the cavalry to roll up the enemy. It had been planned down to the last detail...




7.20 am
The mine underneath the Hawthorn Redoubt in front of Beaumont Hamel was blown giving the waiting German troops the first confirmation of an imminent attack.
7.28 am
Three large and seven small mines were blown, the biggest were two either side of the road at La Boisselle, each containing 24 tons of explosive. One would form the largest crater on the Western Front, Lochnagar.




7.30 am¬†
Zero Hour
The British barrage which had pounded the German trenches for a week with one and a half million shells fell silent and over some parts of the line bridsong was heard. The men who had been waiting in No Man's Land rose up and those in the trenches clambered up ladders and over the parapet and began to walk at a steady pace, as they had been instructed, towards the German trenches. Capt. Nevill (later killed in action) and some of his platoon commanders of the 8th East Surreys kicked footballs into No Man's Land.




7.30-8.30 am
Far from being knocked out by the intense artillery barrage, the Germans were waiting and as the guns fell silent they came from their deep dug-outs to man the trenches and the machine guns, pouring a withering fire into the slowly advancing troops. The wire, which should have been cut by the long preliminary bombardment was in many places virtually intact and as the heavily burdened infantrymen - each carrying around 60lbs of equipment - struggled to find a way through they were mowed down by the German gunners. Second and third waves of infantry followed, while those fortunate enough to survive the machine guns and reach the German trenches fought savage hand-to-hand battles.




8.30 am-Noon
Eighty four battalions had attacked in the first hour, a total of about 66,000 men. Of these it is estimated that around half were casualties after the first hour. On the right the 30th, 18th and 7th Divisions attacking alongside the French had attained almost all their objectives and were fighting towards the village of Montauban. The 36th (Ulster) Division too had successfully reached the second line German trenches near to Thiepval.




However, the attack astride the road to Bapaume had been repulsed with very heavy casualties. During the morning, adhering to the rigid timetable of attack, more waves of infantry poured into the maelstrom, whilst a steady stream of wounded made their way to the rear. The 1st Newfoundland Regiment at Beaumont Hamel fared amongst the worst that day. Ordered into the attack from the reserve trenches, they had to advance over open ground and withstood a hail of fire as they negotiated the British wire. The attack lasted 40 minutes during which 91 per cent, 26 officers and 658 men, had become casualties.




Noon - 2.30 pm
By now it is estimated that nearly 50,000 British soldiers had been killed or wounded, while the survivors of the early attacks were desperately hanging on to the positions they had gained and waiting for reinforcements or new orders. Hundreds of wounded occupied the smashed trenches, shell craters and the medical services were working at full stretch.




2.33 pm
The 17th (Northern) Division was ordered to attack Fricourt. As the men climbed out of the trenches a German machine gun opened fire. In three minutes 123 men had been killed or wounded.




3.00 - 3.30 pm
At Gommecourt on the extreme left the 46th (North Midland) Division was ordered to attack. At the last minute it was called off but the message did not reach one platoon which attacked. Every man except one was hit.




By mid-afternoon the Ulster Division which had achieved success in the Schwaben Redoubt was exhausted and running short of ammunition. Under fire from the village of Thiepval they were hanging on by the skin of their teeth. Mametz fell to the 7th Division after a hard fight.




4 pm-9 pm
The London Division which had successfully taken its objectives at Gommecourt had been forced back to the German front line trench. From the seven battalions which had attacked that morning over 1,700 were dead, 200 were prisoners and 2,300 were wounded. By nightfall they had to give up all they had gained and retreat back to the trenches they had left.




9.30 pm
The Ulster Division, down to their last few rounds of ammunition, were forced to retire from the Schwaben Redoubt to the German front line and as they did so they met the reinforcements they had waited for all day, only now being able to cross No Man's Land. Over 2,000 men from the province of Ulster died by Thiepval, 2,700 more were wounded and 165 were taken prisoner. It was to be more than three months before British troops took the Schwaben Redoubt again.




Aftermath
The first day on the Somme remains numerically the worst military disaster ever to have befallen the British Army. The final return showed a casualty list of 57,470 - 19,240 killed; 35,493 wounded; 2,152 missing; 585 taken prisoner.




It has been estimated that German losses for the day were about 8,000 including 2,200 taken prisoner.",2018-01-30T09:12:35.000Z,0
