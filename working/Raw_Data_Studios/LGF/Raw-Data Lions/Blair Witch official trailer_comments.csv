2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"In my opinion this movie completely debunks the whole premise of the original Blair Witch Project movie. The whole premise of the original was the sheer confusion on wether or not the Blair Witch was real. There is no real evidence that it’s real, perhaps the two guys murdered the girl. That is a possibility, why else would you throw out a map? He wasn’t as idiotic to do such a thing, although doing it. So this movie  basically completely debunks the mystery of the Blair Witch Project. One of the main reasons the movie is considered good.",2019-11-11T18:51:02.000Z,0

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"Ok, after all the negative reviews let me write a positive one. Seen this movie yesterday and it wasn't bad at all. There were a few good scares and yes it does look like the 1999 one but thats why i like it, the original Blair witch is still one of my all time favorite movies. You see nothing bloody or gory and thats what makes it creepy. I thought back in the day that it was real footage lmfao. Oh and do we remember the second Blair witch movie? Now that was a big pile of crap movie. 2016 one is a decent movie, where of course the black guy dies first ;) I'll give this movie 3 stars out of 5.",2019-11-02T16:15:37.000Z,0

However, the director in an interview advised that it was not actually the witch. He didnt specify exactly who or what it was. It must of been some sort of minion of hers that goes after the lost hikers and does the dirty work lol?...overall the sequel was a pretty good movie. All of the false jump scares were pretty annoying to the point that one of the actors calls  it out which was humorous. I enjoyed seeing the reveal of time travel and the physical manipulation of the woods by the witch. The ending scene inside the house was terrifying.",2019-09-06T22:09:43.000Z,0

There was an overuse of the loud sound - person appearing in front of the camera I guess jump scares. It was so overused to the point of ridiculousness. They were using in even when switching between characters. It was so dumb. I mean if you cut your foot in this movie, a fucking predator is gonna grow from that! that's how dumb this movie was.

Honestly, it wasn't bad. The idea is pretty good but it can be.. so much better. So many things unexplained. If you get scared easily and wants a good scare, this good is not bad to watch. But legit 99% of the movie consists of jump scares and it's just the characters making weird screaming noises out of no where. Which is so fucking dumb. If you're in the middle of the woods in the dark.. why would you approach your friend from behind without saying a god damn word. -_-",2018-04-07T15:26:42.000Z,1

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,Total opposite of what made the original scary. No scene in this film came close to the first few nights in the first film. The original remained a bit more on the realistic side. It wasn't all Hollywood staged and tweaked on effects. The ps2 looking ghost didn't help much either. The camera usuage wasn't fitting this time around. The first film got by on it. This film really fucking annoyed me. From the calling out for each other and that annoying camera sound effect shit. Everything is annoyingly sound tweaked to shit. No character development either. Could careless about any of them. The relations in the first film seemed authentic. The realistic factor was missing here. It was all Hollywood put. Something the first film avoided throughout much of the making. Once again. Annoying! Half the time you are wondering what the fuck is going on. Just all over noisey bullshit,2017-09-18T19:47:49.000Z,0

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"I saw it yesterday. It is not the greatest horror movie I have ever seen, but it is not as bad as people made it sound. My main criticism is that it is too much ""over the top"". Too many forest sounds, too many chases in the forest, the house is too decayed... What is great about found footage is that it is supposed to diffuse fright in a more subtle manner, rather than put you in panick mode for 90 minutes. We see too much of the witch, too much of the ""ghosts"". This movie just shows too much, and by doing so, lacks that charm the original had by suggesting all along (and in the end confirming) the presence of an unnatural force, rather than showing it in your face. It is overall well done though, it has a lot of effective jump scares, and is much intense and ""fantastic"" than the other. If it is what you like in a horror movie, you might like this one. I think it is worth seeing for every horror fan, so everyone can have his own opinion.",2016-12-26T12:47:27.000Z,1

I mean you don't need to see the movie to know they are all gona die...wtf",2016-10-31T10:13:19.000Z,0

But the characters are a hit and miss.  there is no massive backstory(except for james), which is pretty good but his backstory is neither strong nor convincing enough (It becomes important in the climax)The first 30 mins are highly cliched, lots of false jumpscares, 'noises in the woods', partying,'the shit that starts off like nothing and then becomes a serious scary shit' and so on. Overall the story is drab, but they did stick to a recipe that can actually induce some scares.
Would rate 2.5/5. Worth a watch? If you have not seen a horror movie for a long time and want some entertainment for couple of hours, watch it. But please leave your logical thinkng behind and stop dissecting the movie if you want to enjoy it",2016-09-23T20:12:53.000Z,0

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"Listen, I'm a huge fan of the first film. I've seen it easily about ten times in my life, and each time I enjoy it. The film was/is awesome because it created some kind of possibility that any one of us could rent a camera and shoot a movie dirt cheap, it gave people hope that anybody could make a movie. It's also very unsettling, much like the discomfort level you feel when watching The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) because it almost felt like watching something really happen. TBWP is hosted as a last document, from start to finish, of three people's mysterious deaths. What more could you ask a horror movie to have?

It was also an original experience, a fresh idea and execution. 

Blair Witch, is not, as they claim, a ""game changing"" horror film. Blair Witch is a knock-off, a re-imagining. It's almost like Rob Zombie bought the rights to it and made it on his own (he didn't, obviously), in that same vein. The film, itself, contributed a few cool things for the mythos of the Blair Witch, few as in far and little. The rest of the movie, from start to finish, is basically completely derived from the first film. They took so many ideas that had already been thought up and stamped them in probably because it was easier than having the characters do something different with their time in the woods. 

They took an idea that could have had potential and turned it into another loud-bang thriller, one of many others, that rely on jump-scares way too much and doesn't tap any further than that.",2016-09-21T02:49:47.000Z,0

I feel like everyone is just disregarding it because they're cult fans of the original or they're hopping on the bandwagon of ""every new horror movie is shit"". These movies are fun. Horror movies hardly ever have a deep, meaningful story. They are about scaring their audience, keeping them on the edge of their seat. This movie does it well. See it first at least, then formulate an opinion.

side note - This movie answers the question regarding why the dude in the original was standing in the corner facing the wall. They shouldn't have spoiled that part in the trailer IMO, look at the witch, you're dead.",2016-09-20T08:12:13.000Z,56

I agree with the other commenters that the jump scares were cheap and made no sense. It's usually just their companions crashing into them for no good reason. The ending was predictable you can see it from a mile away. The shaky cam was really annoying too. But the movie excelled in building tension though.

I want characters I can relate to who I can become attached to so I have a greater chance of being scared of something happening to them or them getting killed. I want actual scares, psychological, eerie, unsettling. Those things exist and a cheap flight or flight reaction isn't as scary as that.

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"My opinion of the new Blair Witch movie: horrible. The whole thing was just completely full of tired cliches, the actors were pretty bad, the dialogue was not realistic, but the worst part was all the cheap jump scares...they weren't even GOOD jump scares. You literally saw nothing, ever. There would just suddenly be these loud bangs, the camera would jerk around wildly, and you would just see nothing at all. Just totally random loud bangs for no reason with sudden camera movement.

In my opinion, this movie represents and is a perfect example of a serious decline in America's intelligence and taste. Most of the people in the theater? They loved it. They actually loved this piece of shit excuse for a movie. I think in another couple of generations, this country is going to be so unbelievably stupid.

This movie doesn't hold a faint candle to the first, original Blair Witch Project.",2016-09-16T03:48:59.000Z,115

It was the first of its kind. It literally created a new genre of horror movies. I personally adored the film with its looming feeling of terror and the idea of more ""thinking of what's out there"" than actually seeing it. 

And then when they do this to it. Adding jumpscares, gross out horror, meaningless gore, and even a cliche little girl voice singing a popular song slowly to make it seem scary, it's literally taking an original concept and shooting it in the throat. So, no. No thanks Hollywood.",2016-09-11T02:58:15.000Z,0

He then returned to his cabin after many years and killed the 3 students in the original film. now presumably he would be dead now due to old age in the new film.

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"I honestly do not get the appeal of shoddy camera movies at all. 

The original Blair witch couldn't really tell its own story and left me thinking... that i didn't really see a film at all, and that i was supposed to believe it was real or something, at the least it feels like it wanted me to view it that way.

But people like it? it had a scene that was turned into a meme ten times over, placing the camera right under a girls nose as it starts running wasn't scary it was just cringy |:

This movie, objectively speaking, was just terrible. But it's getting a sequel because people liked it, meanwhile hordes of people hate on movies that are just fine.

Honestly the movie industry is getting pretty ridiculous, So many film series were destroyed before they even started despite being actually pretty good movies, for absolutely terrible reasons that are straight up nitpicking.

Yet a movie like this with amateur camera work that prevents us from seeing the character/s central to the plot in such a way that it's just annoying is actually successful? o_O

If you like it good for you, its an extra movie you can enjoy, and that isn't a bad thing.

I just honestly don't get how movies like this can be successful enough to generate a sequel, even if it's later down the line.

Yet movies such as john carter and Jupiter rising which are meant to be a film series, flop hard with pretty much no decent reason at all.

John carter's primary reason is that they deviated from the book somewhat, and it pissed off those who enjoyed the book. But for me, as someone who hadn't read the book, the movie itself was really good, and it would have been great for it to get its deserved sequel.

This is why people seem to think the films industry are running out of ideas. They aren't, the creative stuff just seems to flop for dumb reasons |:",2016-09-07T11:38:39.000Z,0

This movie would have been much more interesting and with an even better premise by having the main characters knowing that the blair witch project was fake but the decide to go to the woods anyways and discover that it was a real legend. meaning... everything was real. and by doing that you would have connected not only the first movie to this one, but the second one too.

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"It goes to show the difference in generations. What made the first Blair witch good, was how understated it was.  It didn't rely on loud noises and jump-scares to be scary.  It was done in such a way that it put the viewer in the experience, too.  The movie was emotional and scary because you could empathize with the characters, and suspend your disbelief to a point where you felt like you were there.  Nowadays, most horror movies rely on shaky-cam and predictable jump-scares, in lieu of a good story or suspenseful plot lines or emotional character arcs.  The first Blair witch was somewhat believable because it left the supernatural elements to your imagination, whereas (albeit all of my info is only from the trailer) this new one looks to be more ""in your face"" with it.  It's like they focus-grouped the first movie, and just took all the scary parts that tested well from the first one and just made a movie about those parts.  Obviously I haven't seen the movie yet, but as is the case with mostly all modern horror movies, it's probably overdone and not truly going to live up to the reviews and claims of it being ""One of the scariest movies ever made"". Attention spans have shortened these days. If you take a teenager and try to get them to watch the original ""Psycho"", or ""The Exorcist"", they would probably tell you that it's too slow and not scary.  To me, a scary movie comes from the plot, not the special effects.",2016-08-24T17:18:18.000Z,0

Back then you couldn't google if it was fake or get IMDb info on your mobile. Basically we went into this thing thinking it was real, and so was the rest of the theater.

I always wondered if they purposely asked theaters to turn off the AC during the movie. I also remember how swarms of people were chatting afterwards about what we had just watched. When have you ever done that with the movie?

A sequel (prequel depending on who you talk to and certain specifics) to 'Cloverfield', a 2008 found footage classic. 10 Cloverfield lane did not go in the direction of it's predecessor, and was shot in the form of a normal movie. Both movies were spectacular, and I think that if 'Blair Witch' producers had taken note, then we would be looking at a much more original movie.

Step 1: Buy, rent or steal the rights to an established brand or character which people like. If it is a movie, no amount of poor sequels should disuade you.
Step 2: Write a quickie screenplay which shamelessly retreads old territory, conjures memories of the original and in general, dines out on the original. No emphasis on quality or originality. Don't bother, besides, they take time and we want the product out ASAP.
Step 3: Cast the most generic, WB milk toast actors in this dribble. Keep the cost down.
Step 4: Title it as close to the original as possible. Reboot, Prequel, reimaginings, all worthy labels.

I'm 35 now. They keep making all these remake movies because they want us to continue to live in a state of deja vu. The Establishment keeps coming out with remakes of movies 10 years older longer. Why can't you people see that the establishment use his movies as propaganda to get our mine's ready for stuff that will happen in the future. The biggest thing that the establishment is pushing right now is an alien invasion. You need to know who Jesus Christ is so you can see through the Antichrist spirit that is working on Earth. there will be a great deception using Project Blue beam Holograms and N events that will take place that will be bigger than 911 to change everything on Earth to draws closer to a one world government and a one-world religion and One World Currency. An alien invasion bringing all the countries on Earth together is the easiest way for the United Nations to bring in the Antichrist spirit.

However, Season of the Witch was a sequel in which it was set up as a sort of sequel that dealt with the popularity of the movie at the time which was a movie in the world of the season of the witch and they went to the location of where the blair witch happened and they ended up discovering that the Blair witch was real  even though it was completely fictional to begin with.

This doesn't look like it's going to be any good. Like, at all. I don't want to know exactly what happened to the protagonists of the first movie. The mystery was part of the horror. It was terrifying because you don't know what exactly happened. The fact so much is left to the viewer's imagination is what's so effective, as well as the low budget. The protagonists didn't have the greatest equipment they could. The stuff they'll be using in this movie is too good to be believable. The biggest thing is that I fear they may go and do something stupid and show us what's chasing them. We never saw the Blair Witch or God knows whatever else may have been after the college students in the first movie and that worked so damn well. I never found something for me to interpret so horrifying in my life. If we see the Blair Witch, it's going to fail to hold up to the unseen one from the first movie for obvious reasons. This movie is doomed.",2016-08-08T05:27:05.000Z,1

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,I believe a very good 2nd blair witch movie would have been if they used the same filming method as 1st time but with less shaky camera method. Don't use no Hollywood background light bulshit in the woods like they did with book of shadows (watch the night time background scenes of each movie blair witch and the night scenes in the woods on the book of shadows and you'll know what I mean) they should of had almost the same story line such as a couple kids go into the woods looking for the Blair witch and/or the 3 missing from 1994. This time in this movie show more of the night scenes (just like BWP slowly increasing the scare) they find the 7 piles of rocks and a separate 3. This time they could of had the little kids voices and also heather mike and josh's spirit voices tormenting them. And I think a scary ending would be if 1 or 2 people were left the last night in the tent and the cameras lighting went out but still recording sound an they hear the witch/spirits coming and they know they are going to die and can't even see an inch infront of they're face. 👈as if you were out in the deep forest at 3am on a moonless night with no city lights laminating the near by sky's.,2016-08-05T08:53:36.000Z,0

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"How to make a Hollywood trailer: 

1) WOOOOOOOOM (Make sure sub-bass effects are wobbly and pan from left to right quickly)
2) Edit screams and clips so they sound panicked and nonsensical whilst also editing footage for the same effect
3) Essentially lay out the entire plot, structure and narrative over the short trailer to make sure the eyeballs stay glued to the screen (modern people have no attention span, so make it loud and choppy to make sure they finish the video and our YouTube Analytics look incredible to impress management)

All in a day's work. 

Thanks, 

Michael Bay",2016-08-04T02:10:03.000Z,0

""What the fuck?! Why are they remaking The Blair Witch Project?!""  
""This will be a piece of shit, just like the first one!""

Don't look"". What the fuck? It is hard to put into words how this line fills me with so much dread about this movie. It makes me think that instead of being helpless people with bad shit happening to them, they are coming with some kind of stupid knowledge about how to fight the witch. The in-the-corner part of TBWP was the very end of the film when the two remaining kids were getting killed, so I imagine this also takes place at or very near the end of this movie. Are they trying to trick the witch or whatever force is in the house that they are already dead, or mind-controlled or whatever? That is fucking stupid. Are they then going to try to use some mythical doo-hickey to kill it? I swear to god I will vomit blood in the theater to demonstrate my anger.",2016-07-30T00:25:03.000Z,0

The people they interviewed at the beginning of the film were all actors (unbeknownst to them), and whenever they were camping out or wandering through the woods, members from the cast would go off and do some creepy shit to freak them out. Their reactions of terror and anxiety were genuine, and the fact that the movie was shot on a tiny budget of $60,000 was paramount in ensuring its box office success.

Not to mention, it was an original concept that hadn't really been done before in the West (please correct me if I'm mistaken on this). The fact that we're just hearing about this movie now is just fucking sad and is clearly an attempt on the part of the filmmakers to cash in on a franchise that's been all but forgotten about.",2016-07-25T23:15:22.000Z,0

Hell, in the end, you never saw much of anything, and that's fucking great. Now this pile of garbage on a hot summer day reveals every cliche in the handy cam book while giving away the whole movie in the goddamn trailer, letting you know it's throwing out everything you liked about subtlety and giving you everything you hate about modern horror.

PRODUCER: Shit Sam, all the good stuff has been taken, they're making another Spiderman Reboot I heard.
CEO: Christ, again? Well, that doesn't matter, all we need to do is acquire the rights to some recognisable film or TV show, ideally at its peak in the 90s but early noughties is acceptable too. We want something cheap but with high payoff. 
PRODUCER: uhh, Casper the friendly Ghost...Power Rangers...The Blair Witch Project...

1. Shitty camera to enhance the realism of an amateur filmmaker.
2. No music, no editing, just pure ambience of the forest, which was more scary than some shitty stock horror music.
3. Likeable characters.
4. On the spot amateur acting.
5. Loosely based/no script at all.
6. No safety net of an actual camera crew to guide them in the forest.
7. Memorable scenes.
8. Innovative theme that made a landmark in the horror genre.
9. Left a terror that wasn't a jumpscare but an ill feeling that made you go the fuck to sleep at night so the Blair Witch wouldn't get you. 
10. Great, natural pacing.
11. Ending that didn't necessarily leave you in shock but to wonder What The Fuck Happened.

If I left anything out feel free to add onto it.",2016-07-25T00:12:40.000Z,0

I just don't see how a sequel made in 2016 could even compete with the original, given the evolution of the genre since then and the saturation of found footage films in theaters in the past few years.

There are a gazillion scripts out there from unknowns, but Hollywood is a ""closed shop"", and it's all about money, not art. Since studios already own the rights for a film, it's cheaper for them to create a remake. The hope is that since the formula worked before, it will work again for a new audience. It's about return on investment, nothing more.

If you want Hollywood to stop its remaking juggernaut, don't see any remakes in theaters. Otherwise, unless the US economy bounces back on a grand scale, seeing new and original commercial films from Los Angeles will be few and far between.",2016-07-24T18:47:44.000Z,0

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"As a fan of Blair Witch Project, I'm pretty interested to see this one. Of course it will be different from the original (different kind of horror, HD video, and shit happening on screen.), but still, from what I've seen, it's still largely better than Book of Shadows.
Plus, after reading reviews, it seems that this movies connects with the first one, a lot. The only mistake could be that they didn't want to take risks. This movie has apparently a lot of scenes remades from the original to the new actual one. But if the Blair Witch's lore is taken seriously, then it could be good.

I don't think it will tie with the original one, but it could be the sequel we all wanted if Book of Shadows never existed.
And yeah, Book of Shadows NEVER existed. Right, guys ?",2016-07-24T17:00:55.000Z,0

1. Think of an old horror movie (that is recognizable and or has a following).
2. Get rights to said horror movie.
3. Hire actors straight out of James Lipton's school but more of the shittier schools.
4. Get a run of the mill camera crew and a no name director.
5. Be sure to write a boring and bland script.
6. Here's the most important thing. The movie? Ha! No the movie trailer!
7. Incorporate *Horror_audio_356.wav* then splash a little of *Jump_scare_568.wav* and add some shaky cam.

Aaaaand Tada! Your movie will be in theatres for two whole weeks and then its the big time REDBOX/FREE ON- DEMAND FEATURES.",2016-07-24T16:30:35.000Z,0

That is what made that movie scary. Because it was supposedly FOUND and REAL footage; there was no music, no jump scares, just children's voices, the sounds of the woods at night and cryptic messages they would find and dead body parts. Watching that movie and believing it was all found footage is was scared the shit out if me. This new movie is not based on. Found footage; it's us watching what happened to his sister and her friends. Don't you want to know? I always wanted to know..I seen the original in the movie theater and the ending terrified me and I cried for that guy standing in the corner and we speculated what had happened to him.. I thought the whole thing was real.. Yes, I was gullible,  but I'm guessing I wasn't alone in that. But the point is, we were left wondering what happened to her..  And I'm

That's not what the Blair witch project was about. It's all about realism. Sure we have had cameras now but cmon no teenager can produce a film like this. The special thing about the Blair witch was the fact that it seemed 100% real. Shit I thought it was real for years after. This on the other hand seems like another paranormal.

The directors of the first Blair Witch were kinda terrible human beings. All that anger and anxiety and terror that you see from the actors in the movie is real. The directors gave the actors their script and camera, and then gave them them the shooting locations, which also had food. As the filming went on, though, the amount of food the actors were given began to shrink. Then at night, the directors would go to their tent and shake it and scratch at it and just fuck with their actors minds. After filming the movie, the three actors had to deal with PTSD. Obviously, the directors of this movie couldn't do the same. Stuff like that would hit the news. Hopefully....",2016-07-24T09:52:14.000Z,0

Has great atmosphere/creepy locations. Marble hornets is more centered around abandoned places and woods and stuff like that, and TribeTwelve  is more focused on home invasion by strange entities.

Three people auditioned to be part of a film and were dropped in the middle of bush, were told an outline of a story, given a camera and improvised the rest. The directors would make the little figures out of sticks, threw away a map and even took a cast member away, the rest were up to the talents of the actors to react to these consequences. The story on the website got out and people wanted to see this documentary style movie most believing this was all true.

It will never ever live up to The Blair Witch Project (1999), one of, perhaps, greatest horror movies in the history.  Remember, Hollywood still avoid the issues, such as lacking diversity, sexism or ignorance.  Yet, they won't give a shit about whatever the customers want.

He goes to Burkittsville, MD with a bunch of friends/locals, they are haunted by a strange prescence and after a few horror scenes they find Rustin Parr's house (that was demolished but surely Elly Kedward, The Blair Witch, stops time at that part of the Black Hills so its a timeless area). The whole point of that part is that they go inside a wormhole, and found themselves in 1994, at the moment Heather and Mike were at the house, they are killed by the Witch and the video is found by another search party in 2016 so we can make another sequel.",2016-07-24T00:32:09.000Z,0

Everyone was horrified. It was a completely new twist in the whole horror genre with the ""found footage"" concept. Being a part of that was something I will never forget. It was genuinely frightening. No gorey slasher scenes, no CGI, no big Hollywood budget, just a few relatable kids with a video camera, and the terror of what lurked in the shadows stalking them. Unfortunately these days, no one is really scared of anything anymore. Jump scares are expected in ""horror"" movies, and it's always the same predictable principle. I am curious about this new movie. But nothing will ever chill me to the bone the way the ""Blair Witch Project"" did in the 1990's.",2016-07-23T23:09:37.000Z,0

Then struggle sleeping through the night. knowing there's a mystery being solved, and a spooky one at that, why?! would any of these characters be wandering around in the dark? Why can't any of the searching be done during daytime hours, when.... ITS LIGHT OUTSIDE. I guess it is just me, but I get too freaked out at night, in the middle of the woods, knowing there's witchery going on. And if I woke up and there were all those stick dolls made around me, well, time to pack it up boys! quest would be over at that time. This is why I find it hard to watch these movies, the characters are usually the dumbest people on earth.

Obviously being that the concept has already been had, any subsequent movie simply cannot be as good do to familiarity.  The original Blair Witch movie I thought was completely cool!  It was a new concept in film making, and once you got the story, made for a great experience.  I still watch the original around Halloween...and although it isn't as cool as the first few times I saw it, I still enjoy it.  Part of this is because I spent a great deal of time camping and hiking in the woods...and pay attention closely to seasons and how they feel and look to me as a human.  Some people said it was boring...well maybe they lack imagination...and the sensitivity...but it was what YOU DIDN'T  see is what made it so enticing.  In this age of CGI...geezz anything is possible...and for me...is far less dynamic and interesting.    Book of Shadows was cool too...although not as good as the original movie...I still like it.

This is exactly how I would have imagined the sequel except it would have been found footage too. The original was so visceral and realistic. You couldn't even tell they were acting at all. They looked genuinely terrified and confused and angry. Yes you didn't see what killed them but you'd be utterly terrified if you put yourself in their situation. Seeing ritualistic crosses made out of sticks hung around you, hearing children at night, having your tent being broke into by an unseen force, going in circles no matter what direction you walk, and finding your friends teeth and tongue in a shirt when he goes missing after taking a piss. Realistic, terrifying situations to be in. Nothing will ever top it.",2016-07-23T17:02:55.000Z,0

The actors actually did get lost. One of them dropped a $10,000 camera. Everyone was cold and tired and didn't sleep and they started hating each other. The internet wasn't as big back then so people (I was in high school at the time) actually thought this was a real event and not a movie. It was the first ""found footage"" movie that really made the genre (The Last Broadcast came first but it was pretty shit) and it played with horror tropes spectacularly. If you thought ""it was boring"" you're probably too young or retarded to understand horror and I *guarantee* you thought Insidious was a good movie.

Making a sequel in 2016 with HD camera, obvious actors, the internet and everything... it's not going to work. I can tell by the trailer alone that it's not going to work because they're going to show everything and fucking ruin the pacing.",2016-07-23T16:49:13.000Z,262

I loved the suspence of the first film and the fact that you could actually give many explanaations to the phenomena that happens in the woods since the characters talk about legends and stuff but you never actually get to see the menace that's stalking them. I always envisioned the story as one of time travel since the characters don't seem to find the road back and the fact they stumble upon the cabin at the end of the movie wich is actually implied to have been burned down some time after the 40's if you go and read the original movie site. And also other elements in the movie seem to imply the character have fallen in a time loop. Maybe i'm wrong but this is theory i like and i'm curious to see what explanation the sequel will give if any.

Jumpscares aren't scary, they are the lowest form of horror and any horror movie that relies on them as the main horror element deserves no right to be called a horror movie.",2016-07-23T06:53:47.000Z,0

Same themes of getting lost in the woods, distrust in a group of people, slowly going crazy, except now they're actually showing the blair witch, which could actually end up ruining the horror of never seeing the blair witch in the original.

I'll probably check it out anyway but eh, i'm pretty skeptical so far.",2016-07-23T06:53:08.000Z,0

2016-07-23T03:15:02.000Z,girSv9UH_V8,Blair Witch (2016 Movie) - Official Trailer,"The reason the first one was scary was because it was the fear of the unknown. It hinted at the fact that there was something paranormal but it could have easily just been some teens trying to fuck with them, or some murderer, or ANYTHING. The movie hinted at so many possibilities at the beginning, with the creepy lady with a fence made out of twigs (like the stick men in the trees) and the two fishermen who knew a lot about the Blair witch, where it could have been any number of things that could have happened to them, not just something paranormal. This fucking movie not only is an attempt to bank off the original, but ruins what made the original scary, and takes away whatever people wanted to believe. Everyone is scared of the unknown, but paranormal shit is so fucking over played now a days. If you liked the original Blair witch or not, it fucking changed horror films forever.

Here we actually hear things other than a few children giggles and see vague glimpses of something. some indication of presence. I get the first film had the budget of a sandwitch (wah wah), but even with that budget, SOME sort of effect could've done something. It always felt like they were alone and felt less real due to the constant insistence on using the camera the way they did, made it less scary for me.
