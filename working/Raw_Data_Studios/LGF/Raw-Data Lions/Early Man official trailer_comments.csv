The devil has many ways into luring people away from the Truth. Resist Him and He'll flee.

If you seek God with all your heart you will find Him. He will speak to you at His time. Once He speaks to you, obey Him until the end, and stay loyal to Him even unto death, and your reward will be with Christ in heaven.

If your willing, live a holy, righteouss and blameless life. Confess and repent of your sins to God. He will transform you into His image, and all for His Glory.

If your willing, now is the time to prepare for the return of the King. He is coming back soon to judge the world. 

I don't wish to see anyone disappointed on that day. It will be a terrible day for the wicked, on the Day Of The Lord. 

Take care and God bless you",2019-03-09T19:28:42.000Z,0
