It all seemed to come down to making him choose which one of his kids should be punished in hell.  One kid doesn't seem to love him anymore.  The other kid sneaks out of the house sometimes.  And this somehow is supposed to equate to killing kids.  I'm sorry but if one of his kids was about to murder his little daughter then he would have no problem deciding to stop them.  He wouldn't just simply let it happen just because he loves both of them.  Sure, it might still make him sad but it would be the easiest choice ever.  Which takes you full circle back to his original question about how his daughter could be allowed to die... especially so horribly.  And this was just one of many faulty aspects brought up in the movie.  The entire thing was just one big theist circle jerk.",2018-01-10T20:59:12.000Z,0

I've never wrote a Journal before. To think of my writing is humerus. For I'm dialysis. As I think to myself what is a point? Who would care of my voice in their ears? But laying next to my wife I realize maybe one day kids and wife would be a beneficial. 

As laying next to my half. My mind slip away.......Have you ever wonder who god is? Have you ever stop and listen or even dare to question our creator? I don't know about every one. But I know I have. Some time I wish its as easy to write a letter to god. But if it where that easy. Then the question of life wouldn't be so complicated. We know we all think we focuses on god. We all reminds ourself and love ones. ""We love god"". But putting my foot out in the working world as my 1st truly honest business man. Starting from his humble start. In trailer and truck. With his last money he went back to construction. A busy humble small success. ""I realized"". I've forgotten about god. This long road path. With every step of the way some how I felt he is with me. All this I tell me self each time I see a penny on my road path. Reminding my self two word...""thank god for walking with me"".  For tomorrow that meal for my family might be gone.

For the next 16 years with my wife. Some how we never starve. We manage to make day by day. With little improve each year. The rodeo was complicated and strive thought extreme complication. But who house is beautiful?

I look on FB, instagrame, every one house is beautiful happy like a dream. The wonderful 1000 friends or followers, The amazing party and event, the beautiful girlfriend, that crazy drugs life. That sexy outfit, forcing our eyes on the color, fabrics of life on medias. But I have forget to thank god. 

It's take months of busy working. Focusing on the next step in life. It come down to one movie today that help me stop. And write this journal. ""The shack""...the movies help me truly understand who god is. Thank you",2017-07-11T04:08:11.000Z,0

But I know I have. Some time I wish its as easy to write a letter to god. But if it where that easy. Then the question of life wouldn't be so complicated. We know we all think we focuses on god. We all reminds ourself and love ones. ""We love god"". But putting my foot out in the working world as my 1st truly honest business man. Starting from his humble start. In trailer and truck. With his last money he went back to construction. A busy humble small success. ""I realized"". I've forgotten about god. This long road path. With every step of the way some how I felt he is with me. All this I tell me self each time I see a penny on my road path. Reminding my self two word...""thank god for walking with me"".  For tomorrow that meal for my family might be gone.

For the next 16 years with my wife. Some how we never starve. We manage to make day by day. With little improve each year. The rodeo was complicated and strive thought extreme complication. But who house is beautiful?

I look on FB, instagrame, every one house is beautiful happy like a dream. The wonderful 1000 friends or followers, The amazing party and event, the beautiful girlfriend, that crazy drugs life. That sexy outfit, forcing our eyes on the color, fabrics of life on medias. But I have forget to thank god. 

It's take months of busy working. Focusing on the next step in life. It come down to one movie today that help me stop. And write this journal. ""The shack""...the movies help me truly understand who god is. Thank you",2017-07-11T04:08:02.000Z,0

The book ended with him telling police about where his daughter was¬†and they went to the cave and found her. also found the killer and other little girls that had been killed. Movie left that out. Read the book. Some people have dreams when in comas and some dream while asleep. You who are non-believers need to open your eyes and read history. Jesus is real and lived on earth and he rose from the grave. He is written about more then anyone in history. I pray for all who can't believe in God and Jesus.,2017-05-03T23:24:53.000Z,0

We are sinners and the law cannot make us right with God! It can only condemn us. 

We've broken all the of God's commandments . We deserve punishment in Hell forever. And guess what? The day is coming when God will judge everyone according to their deeds. If He finds you guilty...He will surely throw you into hell. Why? Because He is Just. But this same God is generous and merciful, with patient, faithful and good. He forgives sins. 

We need a savior. This savior must be fully God, fully man, Jew and under Old Testament law, born of a virgin and without sin.
His name is Jesus. 
God sent His son, Jesus. Jesus lived a perfect life, he obeyed all of his Father commandments. Willingly he went to the cross and died and paid the fine/penalty of everyone who believes in him on the cross with his blood. After 3 day He rose again. He ascended into Heaven. And at this moment he is seated at the right hand of his father. 

Commanding everyone, everywhere to: 

Repent and put their trust in Him (Jesus) as their one and only savior. God will forgive all your sins . 

Warning: He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.‚Äù",2017-03-12T04:55:11.000Z,0

2016-12-01T17:18:14.000Z,waTEbgLYG-g,"The Shack Official Trailer #1 (2017) Sam Worthington, Octavia Spencer Drama Movie HD","Young‚Äôs stereotypical characterization of the Father as a ‚Äúlarge beaming
African-American woman,‚Äù the Son as a Jew with a large nose, and the Holy
Spirit as a mysterious Asian female makes me more than a little queasy.
Furthermore, virtually every theological heresy begins with a misconception of the nature of
God. The Shack is no exception. After chiding those he believes to have
misconceptions about the Trinity, Young proceeds to compromise, confuse, or
outright contradict biblical orthodoxy. He pictures the Father bearing
crucifixion scars as well as being incarnated in tandem with the Holy Spirit.
In historic, biblical Christianity only the Son is incarnated and only the Son
suffers and dies on the cross.
Moreover, Young pontificates that Jesus ‚Äúhas never drawn upon his nature as God to
do anything‚Äù (emphasis in original). Those who have read through the Bible will
immediately recognize the falsity of this statement‚Äîparticularly with respect
to the resurrection. For example, in John‚Äôs Gospel Jesus says, ‚ÄúThe reason my
Father loves me is that I lay down my life‚Äîonly to take it up again. No one
takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay
it down and authority to take it up again. This command I received from my
Father‚Äù (John 10:17‚Äì18 NIV). Equally problematic is the fact that Young negates
the notion of functional subordination within the Godhead. As the large beaming
African-American woman in Young‚Äôs novel explains, the Trinity is ‚Äúin a circle of
relationship, not a chain of Command.‚Ä¶Hierarchy would make no sense among us‚Äù
(emphasis in original). In biblical orthodoxy, however, the incarnate Christ
says, ‚ÄúI tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; He can do only
what He sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also
does‚Äù (John 5:19 NIV). Put another way, functional hierarchy is not
antithetical to ontological equality.
Finally, Young has Jesus‚Äîthe Jew with the big nose‚Äîdeclaring, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a Christian‚Äù and
‚ÄúI have no desire to make them [Buddhists, Mormons, Muslims, etc.) Christian.‚Äù
Indeed, Young describes Christians as religious fanatics and part of a sinful
world system. In sharp distinction, the followers of Christ adopted the word
‚ÄúChristian‚Äù in the midst of suffering and persecution. The apostle Peter, for
example, writes, ‚ÄúIf you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed but praise
God that you bear that name‚Äù (1 Pet. 4:16 NIV; cf. Acts 11:26).
The fact that The Shack is being touted by those who take the sacred name of Christ
upon their lips is a sad commentary on Christian discernment. As has been well
said, ‚ÄúIf you haven‚Äôt read The Shack, don‚Äôt.‚Äù ‚ÄîHank Hanegraaff

I've seen that so many of you are dissapointed because of how this movie is based on a Christian life story. For me it doesn't seem right to judge something because it relates to Christianity...

We took turns crying trying to read it. Why so many negative comments? The author explained in the beginning that it was fictional and he wrote it for his kids. Maybe it's not 100% biblical but neither was the work of CS Lewis and there's not a church out there that would argue Lewis' imagination and say he wasn't biblical. Lewis said the Gospel didn't make sense to him until he used his imagination. Don't put God in a box...he's greater than any of us can imagine.,2017-01-29T21:49:30.000Z,0

I fear it will get to ""preachy"" and want to tie things up in a pretty little bow. Life doesn't, has never, and will never work that way. Faith, logic, spirituality, religion, whatever one personally holds to in order to get through the joys and pains of life is a common thread that all humans share. THAT is what could make this movie truly uplifting, rather than so much schlock designed to appease a target audience. I have no problem with a movie that might have a certain take on religion or spirituality. For example ""What Dreams May Come"". I'm not enough of a cinephile to give other international examples, though I'm sure there are many. Those perspectives are fine.  Just like any movie, it's how the story is told.

The Shack is based off of one of my most favorite novels of all time. It is about a man whose daughter was kidnapped, raped, and murdered in a small shack in the mountains. Months after, this man receives a letter from ""God"", inviting him back to the Shack. 
There, he meets the trinity that is God. specifically, the black lady is God the father, the Asian is the Holy Spirit, and the man is Jesus.

I'm sorry my friend but Biblical Christians do not hide their shame or sin, biblical Christians admit their shame, guilt, and sin against almighty God. God is HOLY HOLY HOLY, and can not tolerate sin in HIS Holy presence. That is why¬†Biblical Christians Love Jesus the Christ. Because Christ lived a perfect life we¬†CAN NEVER LIVE, and Christ took our punishment of ¬†SHAME, Guilt, and SIN¬†on the Cross He suffered the death we deserve to suffer so that we will not go to HELL when we die. He took the wrath of our Father for our SIN and rebellion against HIM(GOD). the Christ defeated the GRAVE so that all who REPENT AND TRUST IN CHRIST ALONE TO BE FORGIVEN well go to Heaven (paradise) to live, love, enjoy, be with God forever. ¬†I'm sorry my dear friend that you have a faulty worldview of Christianity. please read Hebrews in the BIBLE(GODS HOLY WORD) and learn about our great and merciful savior God Jesus the CHRIS the one and only true GOD of the universe.",2016-12-11T02:29:10.000Z,0

Years ago, the book was extremely controversial in the Christian world - in fact friends and fellowships split harshly over it. Most of the haters couldn't get over a black woman representing a big part of God's nature and wisdom - they considered it 100% heresy - and many could not bear to finish reading the short book. But what I took from the book was totally different. The book dealt squarely with an ""all too often"" theme that the church is unable to successfully confront - and that is how is it possible to find/keep/return to ""faith"" in the midst of a terrible human tragedy (of the worst kind). This book takes on an event that would shatter the strongest faith, the kind of event that will always force the question ""how a good God could possibly exist in such a mean, disgusting, terrible world.""

It's a good story about coping with the pain of loss and spiritual healing etc. However with books/films like this,  in the end I can't help but feel that  it's so far removed from reality. People often lose children, parents, siblings, spouses in horrible ways.

Be one type of movie or the other, don't try to splice the two. I appreciate that it's based on the book so this is the direction it follows but it could have remained true and gritty, his delusions didn't need to be so colourful and romanticised they could have gone dark, really dark the kind of darkness you would expect of a man's mind losing his daughter...

Christians don't like this film

now that may not be a surprise to anyone familiar with 'The Shack', but for those who aren't: the reason Christians reject this story is because the nice black lady 'Elousia', the middle-eastern man, and the asian woman 'Sarayu' are representations of the three persons of the Holy Trinity - God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit, respectively

of course some people reading this might say; ""i'm a christian, i think the shack is a beautiful interpretation of whom God is and how God wants us to live"" but i'm afraid they aren't really christians - because anyone who relies on this story to help them understand God, is rejecting the words of Scripture where God constantly refers to Himself in masculine pronouns and reveals Himself as Father

Jesus himself is recorded as speaking of both God the Father and God the Holy Spirit with masculine pronouns

perhaps you don't think this is a big deal, but God also reveals Himself in scripture as being very particular about how mankind represents Him - and we get the word 'Blasphemy' from the idea of giving a witness account in a court of law; and if one gives a false testimony in court, they are 'speaking evil' or 'blaspheming'

and since God goes out of His way in Scripture to refer to Himself in masculine terms, then to represent Him in any other way is a misrepresentation, a false account, or a 'blasphemy'

so bearing in mind that the underlying premise to this whole story is a misrepresentation of whom God is, we then have to ask if the lessons this story teaches 'also' misrepresent what God demands of mankind?

the consensus of real christians is that yes, it does - and anyone who embraces the false god represented in The Shack is still on their way to Hell",2016-12-03T18:28:40.000Z,0

God tells him to come back to¬†the cabin in the note in his mail¬†box. He does not know¬†that this was God.¬†The three people¬†at the¬†cabin represents God, Jesus and Mary.¬†He is brought back to the cabin because it was where he felt the most empty of Gods love.
