I was really hoping for a dark, haunting examination into the birth and mind of a serial killer and the evolution of Leatherface's psyche, but instead we get a dull, comical, cheap and generic directorial style; every scene feels like actors ""trying"" to act, instead of really inhabiting their rolls and creating that suspension of disbelief that made TCM the cult classic it is. 
There are so many pointless, abrupt close ups of people faces, it's as if the director's only experience is with TV soap operas.",2019-09-01T17:56:36.000Z,0

The first movie from 1974 managed to be scary without using these stupid strong synthetic/drone/whatever sounds. 
Actually, when will they stop using these lame sounds?  The best horror scenes actually don't even use music.
And, oh, a mental hospital? How original. NOT. I'm done with the 2010s. Can't wait to see how lame the 2020s will be.
Maybe they'll use an all-transgender cast in the next movie or something.",2019-06-12T22:19:25.000Z,0

2017-08-08T19:01:14.000Z,wt8wybR4sfk,Leatherface Trailer #1 (2017) | Movieclips Indie,"This is a great origin story for Leatherface I found this movie very entertaining and I was not disappointed in it at all this is what Texas Chainsaw The Beginning should have been I would like to see it continue off of this movie but I don't think it will, it's about time they did his origin story now all they have to do is Freddy Kreuger's origin story and we will be all set oh and Jason Voorhees. I liked how they kept his secret in the movie and tried to make you guess who it was until the end. I thought it was bud but whom it turns out to be is who you never expected a little spoiler there but not to bad. The only two actors in this movie I knew were Stephen Dorff who plays Texas Ranger Hal Hartman he also played Decan Frost in Blade and Finn Jones who plays a deputy and he is known for his role as Iron Fist. Stephen does a great job and so does Sam Trike who plays Leatherface. The acting, story, directing and makeup effects are great in this movie.
