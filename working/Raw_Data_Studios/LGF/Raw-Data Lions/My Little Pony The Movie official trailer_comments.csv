I'm someone who had been a fan of mlp for years and I'm not picky when it comes to movies, but this didn't even feel like a movie to me. It wasn't even as good as a episode of mlp, it felt like most of their journey had no point and a lot of the new characters had too little time on screen to show any personality or they were just incredibly annoying. The only new character I liked was the cat, that was it. If you enjoyed this movie that's great! Just sharing my opinion on it.",2018-03-26T00:56:50.000Z,0

1: the main six are one dimensional and are basically stereotypes.

2: the show itself is sooo pandering towards little girls, and it doesn't expand upon it's concept or do anything new, thus why it's so pandering.

3: now this is probably the main problem I have with this show, the whole this with friendship being magic is stupid, because in real life, friendship doesn't do anything, it's not magic it's not power, it's just something people do to feel happy.
 
Now the reason why I think this is the main problem is because not only does it ruin to whole point of this (because it's slice of life show.) But it's a terrible thing for children to learn at a young age, because then they will think that friendship is the answer to all of their problems, and won't use basic problem solving to fix their problems.

Overall a good show that suffers from some major problems if fixed, could make my little pony a much better show and maybe even a masterpiece. Now there are some other problems with the show but these are the main ones.",2018-01-10T09:04:16.000Z,0

I really wanted to see an old villain return or see some exciting new villain show up. I want sombra back. Also, i googled it, and apparently discord isn't appearing in this movie, so i definitely dont like it already.

The only interesting thing was the tirek creature with two legs.",2017-10-11T09:45:32.000Z,1

The film DID feature the same main characters (and their voice actors) from the TV series, showed more familiar characters in the background, introduced new areas and characters not seen in the series, had an assortment of good songs, and had beautiful animation.

However, there were a few small details about the film that didn't quite give it the same spark as the TV series.  
First, the pacing of the film was just a little too quick, and didn't provide time for more possible drama and action moments; granted, the writers were limited to only one hour and thirty-five minutes.  
Second, is that the humor that helped make the TV series fun for Brony fans to watch was stretched a little thin in the film.  
Third, I think the personalities of the three antagonists (The Storm King, Tempest Shadow, and Grubber) could've used a little adjusting; The Storm King could've been more threatening (like Tirek from the Season 4 finale); Grubber could've been less awkward and food obsessed, and was more of a secretly loyal and dependable friend; Tempest could've been a little less mechanical and showed a little more fury and pangs of guilt and regret.
Finally, I think the final confrontation between the Mane Six and the Storm King could've been a bit more epic; all of their allies from the past seasons (all the ponies of Equestria, The Crystal Ponies, Ember and the dragons, Thorax and the Changelings, and Dischord) rallying together to help defeat the Storm King.

I'm not saying it's bad film, I'm just saying that it's a little different from the TV series that Lauren Faust created.  Still, this is just MY personal opinion alone.  I hope this film satisfies the enjoyment of all other fans of MLP: FIM; especially for all you loyal and good-hearted Brony fans!",2017-10-08T20:50:47.000Z,0

I honestly don't know why there's so much hate on this. Yes this is a kid's show, yes, some adults enjoy watching it, but as this is going to be a movie, it'd either be rated G or PG, meaning that up to anyone can watch it! The animation's very fluid and beautiful with details, and it seems to have an interesting story and would most likely have funny villains with some serious ones.
Despite being 16 and a former brony since 2014, this might actually spark up my interest in it again. Again, yes it is a kids show, but even adults need to have a spark of their childhood return even after their own childhood has ended years ago.",2017-09-29T02:17:16.000Z,0

MLP Movie= PG (Parental Guidance advised) for a movie of a show for Y-7 audience about talking midget horses with magic and cupcakes
Whereas something like say...

The animation is gorgeous and definitely makes it stand out from all the usual episodes' animation style, and the visuals and scenes absolutely have a breath-taking feeling going for them. I'll admit that.

But I'm alittle worried about how the cast and the movie will go. The lack of Rarity, Applejack, and Fluttershy, to the point of them not even getting a single line in this trailer deeply worries me. A giant flaw the most recent episodes had was making Pinkie Pie way over the top for the sole purpose of making her comedic relief and nothing else, to the point of showing no fear and being alittle ""too"" happy about even grim-looking situations, which 1:25 proves might keep her as solely a joke and not ""real"" character, which disappoints me already. 

The new characters certainly are certainly well-designed and interesting, but not might fit really well into the MLP universe. I'm really iffy about this Tempest mare and her... seemingly alien force. (Which worries me, too... As throwing aliens into anything can utterly destroy it for me.) Aswell as her design having some very... IDK how to put it... I guess I'll use ""OC design-ish"" to describe her. Unicorns with broken horns has been rather cliched in the MLP community for tons of people and the name ""Tempest"" isn't the most original name out there. 

I know I'm probably sounding super picky and rude, by now, but I'm sorry. I'd like to just get this off my chest.

I'm also iffy about the pirates. While, again, their design are unique and memorable, I feel like they're kinda outlandish, as well. They've been throwing tons of new species and creatures into MLP for a while now, and tons of new characters to the point where it's getting alittle difficult to remember them all. MLP already has tons of memorable characters and some bad ones, so I'm unsure if they have time or the writing to put in all these unique characters that will hopefully have time to develop over the course of the movie and not just be there because they look pretty. I suppose it's for the movie, so hopefully they'll be an important part of it. Along with maybe the seaponies. I'm the kind of person who likes to watch animal movies, and I've noticed a big flaw that most of the movies almost always suffer from: Making way too many characters for the story to follow, resulting in very few of them getting good development.

Lastly, the movie seems like it won't really be too touching, which in my opinion might hurt it. There's so many characters that seem like they'll be there just for comedic relief and jokes, so the real ""conflict"" doesn't seem like a real conflict when everyone's too busy cracking off jokes. I know it's an MLP movie, but I'd love an mlp movie that has touching and deep moments with a real heart to heart between characters instead of ""I'll stop you!"" and then Pinkie or side bad guy making a cake or pie joke. I'd love to see some heart-twisting moments and a real remember-able ending to this movie, and not just a laughfest that makes you feel no real tension.

I know I went off on quite a tangent about this. I'm really hyped up and interested in seeing this. I'm just worried deeply that the movie might just be ""meh"" instead of breath-taking. But... hey. Atleast Starlight Glimmer won't be hurting the movie by being in it, so that's a plus in my books.",2017-09-12T18:29:32.000Z,0

I'm talking to you haters. I'm talking to all of ya. Okay, I'ma begin my rant in just a second, but I need to warm up a bit. Hold up hold up....
Okay, I'm good to go now.

People who came here just to hate on the movie.
Listen up bitches, because the last thing you want is to get into a fight with me in the comments. Okay. If you don't like it, then why the fuck are you here bro? Just to hate on it? Bitch you wasting your time. You could be doing anything else in the world and you choose to do this. Bros, grow some balls and act your age will you? Nobody is gonna listen to some whiny ass bitch who only wants attention and try and prove something that ain't true. Nobody cares! Most fans are gonna square up with you in the comments and they'll body your behind. They will, I've seen it over like 100 times already. More then enough to tell you, bitch shut the fuck up because we ain't gonna stand down until you shut the fuck up and move on with your life. Mind you, not every brony or pega-sister is gonna try and shove MLP down your throats. (I know that's why most people hate it.) Not everyone is gonna do that, one or a few people don't describe the whole fandom. So if you don't wanna get into a fight with someone about your hating, then I suggest you ignore the fandom and videos ENTIRLY! Don't click on them, don't listen to them, don't even look at them bro. The ""I'm not interested"" option is there for a reason when you click on the the three dots. Just click that and you'll be set to go. Simple as that, you won't have to deal with it EVER AGAIN. That's all you need to do, don't just go on it and spread hate and act like a fucking 5 year old. Get a grip and do something else in your life. I know you have eyeballs too, so use them and LOOK AT THE VIDEO TITLE BEFORE CLICKING ON IT!! Ya'll acting like you don't see the titles or some shit, use your eyes that God gave you god damn it!

People who thinks it's for little girls (kids).
One sentence....WHO THE HELL CARES HOW HOLD YOU ARE!? NOBODY GIVES A DAMN! I COULD BE 40 SOMETHING YEARS OLD AND STILL WANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE! JUST BECAUSE IT'S FOR LITTLE KIDS DON'T MEAN OLDER PEOPLE CAN'T WAIT IT EITHER! THEY HAVE THE RIGHT! YOU DON'T HAVE NO SAY IN THE MATTER WHATSOEVER SO SHUT THE FUCK UP!

People who think it's cancerous.
I hope it gave you cancer, because we don't need people like you in our universe. By the way, ""cancer"" and ""cancerous"" are so over used on the internet, the word itself is just IT saying it. It's not even an insult anymore! It's just a word to describe a sickness that most people here in the US and many other countries have. It's not something to be used to describe a movie that's coming out. IT'S JUST A MOVIE FOR PETE'S SAKE! DON'T GET YOUR PANTIES UP IN A TWIST.

People who came here to make fun of others who want to see the movie.
Look man, you might not like it and it's ""cancerous"" and all that, but do you really have to make fun of other people who are actually looking forward to seeing the movie? Like come on bro, what does that say about you? It says you're a fucking a bitch who needs to do something else besides being a bully. If you don't got nothing nice to say, then just don't say anything at all. Just leave a dislike and then leave. Don't comment and then make fun of everyone else who actually want to see it. That's just rude and it's gonna get your ass bodied. You can't just say that and expect people to take it like a fact, like bitch, no. Also, use your eyeballs and read the title of the video! Like I said before, ya'll acting like you don't know how to read or some shit. You need to go back to third grade because obviously you can't read. ""ENGLISH MOTHER FUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK IT?"" You just wasting your breath trying to even get your message across people because guess what. Nobody gonna listen to you. Also, to some of you trying to get people to kill themselves. Bitch, let me tell you, if you really think some people are the tunneled vision and want to kill themselves, then take your sorry ass outside right now. Sit out there and contemplate about your life for a second or two. You're the one who's tunneled vision. You obviously can't see that most people love their life and won't listen to some dumbass on the internet telling them to kill themselves. You obviously can't see that people love what they love and won't stand for someone like you telling them to kill themselves. ""SHUT YOUR BUBBLE GUM DUMB DUMB LOOKING ASS THE FUCK UP""

Yeah, that's basically my rant. If you don't want to read this entire rant and just go right on ahead and hate on me, you need to go to a mental hospital because you obviously need help. If you can't read it, then what the fuck is the point of even arguing about it huh? You might think it's pointless to read a big ass comment like this but I don't. If you're going to start an argument with someone, read the whole fucking comment first before you start hating because you're going to be making yourself look like a dumbass. YOU are putting YOURSELF in that position, not the person, YOU!",2017-09-11T01:25:08.000Z,3

I have to admit from first glance, I'm a little shocked.  From the looks of it, it was made with a different animation tool than the show itself (I'm pretty sure it's Flash), and the art style also took me completely by surprise.  But not a bad surprise, it actually makes the ponies look really adorable, even if it took about a minute to get used to.  

One thing I didn't like was how it hardly looks like it goes above even 30 frames per second.  Granted I don't think it will be that much of an issue, it's still fairly noticeable in parts.  Also the lip syncing looks sub par in some places.  On top of that the overall plot of the movie seems pretty overdone, especially in mlp in general.  ""Great, powerful, evil enemy invades Equestria""... sound familiar?  Tirek, Chrysalis, even Discord kind of.  But I've seen this in so many other movies as well.  I can look past it though simply because it's mlp <3 And of course it looks like there's more going on in this trailer, so maybe it will have that extra creative burst I was hoping for when I first heard about this movie when I end up watching it.

Regardless, I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie.  It has pros and cons of course, but every movie does.  I really hope this will lock the show into a solid few more seasons, too.  I feel like the show is spiraling downward in terms of popularity, at least in the fandom.  It isn't what it used to be... maybe this will launch it into a new era.  I guess we'll see.",2017-08-13T07:24:47.000Z,0

From watching this take a shot based on how many cliches there will be in this film the same as all the ones in the season premieres and finales.
1. A magical threat arrives to destroy Equestria? ✅
2. The mission to save it will be delegated to our main characters, making all the others such as the princesses, the cmc and Shining Armor completely useless( meaning while they are in the movie they won't do anything useful?)✅
3.A celebrity voicing a character who will contribute nothing and is just there to promote a new song?✅
4. A typical evil villain who will probably be A. Defeated by the power of friendship or B. Redeemed by the same thing?✅
5. The moral will be the same generic one we've heard a million times?✅

I think everyone who's been on the internet saw at least one of internet, some sort of recolor, rehash, cross-over, or clone of some character from my Little Pony. Seriously, not only is it a show directed for little girls, but at the same time, the mostly adult fanbase, treats it, like some sort of holy grail of cartooning. Needless to say, Bronies can get more than just 'annoying'.

I think you know what clop is. And it's disgusting. Please stop.

IDK, maybe it's because I think a movie based on the show should try and
 have more of an epic scale. Like it's threatening to be the end. Not 
that it should actually be the end, but that it should make you think it
 could be. Yeah, it looks like an OK kids movie, but does it really look
 as though it's upping the ante from the Season 4 finale?

You all know how big a brony I am by this point, and I think it's quite 
telling that I'm actually more excited for Japan's Live Action Tokyo 
Ghoul movie. And I haven't even seen that anime. But hey, I could be

Hopefully, it's just for the trailer. A lot of the people from the show are involved, so I'll probably enjoy seeing this with my daughter. I do wonder how big the world of Equestria is that they're still able to find all these unique other groups. I mean, Equestria had one of their Queens occupying the moon for a thousand years. How do they continue finding undiscovered lands and groups? Equestria is a fairly technologically advanced society.

It makes me sad to see all of the hate here. Look, if you dislike MLP, PAW Patrol, Steven Universe, etc, I'm fine with that. It's another thing however to call the fans of these shows ""autistic,"" ""gay,"" and other things. We like what we like. Age and gender shouldn't matter, I'm turning 13 in September (I know it's immature to post your age in the comments to prove a point, but I don't care), and I still like Baby Einstein. Please don't bash on those who enjoy MLP or any other fandom. As for the people who make erotic fan fictions/porn of MLP, please stop. That is what is giving people a bad impression of the fandom. To those that are judging us because of that, don't judge a book by it's cover. We may look like a fandom that makes porn and inappropriate fanfiction, but we're actually a really kind, accepting group of people. Sure we have a few toxic members, but that happens in every fandom. Please stop bashing on people because they like one thing, please. Thank you for reading.",2017-07-02T04:50:37.000Z,24

The animation itself is top-notch, But my biggest problem overall is the use of the 3D assets. Places like Canterlot, the Airship, and that propeller look really out of place- like something you'd see in one of those Direct-to-DVD Princess/Barbie/Tinkerbell movies. In stark contrast, the characters themselves look flat, but also poofy because of the shading...? They look like poofy stickers, and it looks really weird. It's even weirder when not all the backgrounds look like that! The bottom of the waterfall looks really good and not out-of-place, what's up with the rest of these places?

Tempest's little toadie looks like he'll be getting on my nerves- The Storm King COULD also, and Pinkie definitely will.

I'm sure it'll be okay, but I'm not seeing much that looks good (although the bad things aren't necessarily deal-breakers either)",2017-07-02T04:24:10.000Z,0

It's also pointless. You don't know what it's like to be hated. If you did, you wouldn't be going to other fandoms, huh?

I am speaking on behalf of all of the bronies out there!
I understand you guys hating this and disliking it, that's alright, but your getting the criticism way too far.
I was scrolling down hate comments from this video and another and I kept seeing the same hate comment over, and over
""Worst than the Emoji Movie!""
""This is cancer!""
""This is/You're gay!""
That isn't right. You know what? We're not acting as kids, you are! You're acting like little toddlers who are hating what they get! Some of you are even copy and pasting other comments saying that this is stupid, for like a million times! Okay, tell me what you hate on this movie. Well, NOTHING!!! Cause it hasn't been released yet! And you are already judging this, not considering the fact that Emily Blunt, Taye Diggs, Kristin Chenoweth, Sia, etc. They are voice acting this very film! And also, Sia is writing a song for this! For some of them, this is their first movie or animated film they're voice acting it! Why waste your time hating when you can just ignore this and move on. This doesn't deserve the hate you have! I know that the previous generations are awful! I know that! Even the Bronies know that it is, but this is different. This show was once directed by Lauren Faust! Even though she is no longer the one that is leading the show, it still stays as a good show as we know. Also, did you know three of the writers of this movie are actually the same writers for Mulan and Toy Story? I'm not kidding! Check out the wiki of the film. This isn't bad as you think this is, so stop complaining and move on if you don't want to get involved. I'm not saying you must love this or you must watch it, I'm just keeping you aware that there are people out there who are working on this film and people watching it.",2017-07-02T23:45:20.000Z,10

Grow up and realize that the only people who live their life watching, reading or listening to things *exclusively* meant for their age bracket, are children. Adults enjoy whatever media they want, because they're adults living their own lives how they want, not children living under the rules of some one else.

“Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”

Can't say I'm a big fan of the new animation, I think Disney makes a better use of ToonBoom mixed with 2D (this was an OBJECTIVE opinion). The art itself is the most jarring thing to me, it'll take a lot of getting used to me, but that's my SUBJECTIVE opinion. 

More OBJECTIVE opinions:
What I'm really worried about, though, is the story and writing. I hope it won't be a common Hollywood blockbuster story, with the ""bad guys come, need help from others, insert comic relief just because and painstakingly adhere to the typical three act structure"" that I'm getting sick of in American animation movie, it's too predictable. Megan McCarthy always had this tendency when writing TV show finales, especially ""A Canterlot Wedding"" that could have been better.

More SUBJECTIVE opinions:
But I DO like the broken-horned unicorn (great design and great potential backstory!) and the villain, also with a great design, keeps reminding me of MojoJojo in a good way. :D
As for the Sea Ponies... well, world building, I guess, but at least their designs are good, at least compared to the godawful G1 designs...
I also like the new Canterlot design: finally a BIG capital city!

BTW... where the heck is Starlight Glimmer? Did she go on vacation? o_O

But, as with most recent American trailers, they rarely give the right feeling of the movie. So I hope my writing and story worries are unfounded and the MLP G4 movie is something that Lauren Faust would be proud of. :)",2017-06-29T09:40:47.000Z,7

However, I'm not a big fan of the so far extremely cliche henchman the new villain has with her, nor am I a fan of the Anthro Griffon and lion. As a whole, this trailer actually left me more worried than hyped--it had nice animations, and the villain looked interesting, but it seems like its falling back on tired Disney tropes instead of original ideas.

From this trailer alone, I'm willing to bet that either the Mane 6 Friendship the villain down, or she falls off a cliff and dies off camera. Either way, I'm expecting an early Millennial Disney movie, and I can honestly say I'm not happy with that.",2017-06-29T07:32:01.000Z,0

The spaceship thing seems strange, I know MLP plays fairly loose with the rules of fantasy but that's a little shark jumpy.

The sea ponies are a great idea though, I like world building. Twilight's word choice of ""save Equestria"" was interesting when talking to them. Are they part of Equestria? Are they allies of Equestria? If so it seems strange we've never heard of them. Maybe they were just persuaded to think Equestria was worth saving, but it is odd. 

Anyway whatever I like the whole idea of exploring the oceans around Equestria and introducing the sea ponies like this.

Other thoughts, um the animation works very well for long shots, the awkward 3D effect is a bit weird in close ups though. So I hope they don't do too many close up shots. It is an action film so presumably they won't which is good lol. But yeah in long shots it works great, the characters looks great and the environments look mostly great as well.

But yeah I don't know, I'm all for pushing genre boundaries if it's done right but these alien things seem a bit forced in there, I'm not sure if that'll work. I hope it does work and I'm just whining about nothing, but I really don't know lol.

Anyway that's all, thanks for reading this whole thing lol, you have a lot of spare time if you got this far.",2017-06-29T06:07:38.000Z,0

Thoughts-
-Backgrounds can look a bit weird with the CG at times, overall good and smooth animation though. 
-Trailers ruin everything, I sort of wish I hadn't watched it. 
-It might take a while to start up looking at it, just for the broader audience. 
-Lot's of fan pandering coming up. 
-Villain design good, looks threatening, but is it a good villain. 
-Original mane 6 so it's probably also aimed at literally anyone who even originally watched the show.  
-It's funny! Loved the how Ryan died. Also the FBI ponies.
I'm looking forward to it!",2017-06-29T04:00:36.000Z,0
