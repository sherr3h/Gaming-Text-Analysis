Seriously, I own the vinyl of the score, I have posters of it on my wall, I have seen the movie god knows how many times and my love for this movie will never stop growing. I  even found the overture to the movie (which is very beautiful, I might add). However, there is something very odd about this trailer. At 1:47 the three roommates are dancing next to a garden. That's not in the movie, and don't tell me it's in the song ""Someone in the Crowd"", because I have seen and studied this film enough to realize that it is not. My guess is that part of the song was cut from the film after the trailer was released, but before the movie came out.

2016-11-03T14:00:00.000Z,0pdqf4P9MB8,La La Land (2016 Movie) Official Trailer – &#39;Dreamers&#39;,"My intepreation of the film: before Mia and Sebastian met each other, they had their own dreams, which they were chasing. Mia thought her biggest dream was to become an actress and Sebastian thought his biggest dream was to save jazz by opening his own jazz club. but then they met each other and fell in love. It was then where they realized, that the actual dream had always been a quite different one: to find true love. And they did find it in each other. Notice also when ""city of stars "" was played the first time in the movie, it was right after Sebastian had told mia about his ""dream"" in the jazz club. But when he sang the line ""is this the start of something wonderful, or one more dream, that i cannot make true"" .. he was actually singing about the dream to find the true love with mia (he kind of felt, she was the right one just by then), but he was afraid to not being able to make this dream come true, because by that time, Mia was still together with this other Guy Greg. Also when ""City of stars"" is played in full lenght later, the lyrics lead to this idea as well. In the last scene of La La Land, when they both have the ""flashback"" of how things should have been going, they both realized, they had given up the real dream: true love. And instead they had followed their other dreams, which is also good, but still the ""true dream"" had always been a different one...",2018-10-14T10:45:36.000Z,1

I remember last year my cousins and I with our family watched this movie. And when it came to the end me and my cuzins died of heart attack, we were so disapointed and sad of how it ended. We said we were never gonna watch a romance musical movie ever. I love this movie so much, it has brought so many tears. But it shows that reality is a thing and not everything ends perfect. It broke my heart that they had to go seprate ways for there dreams, but there dreams was also very important but they know that one day they will find that something and never let go.. I remember the song, If you love her then let her go. I love you Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone.. 😭😭😭❤️❤️",2018-07-03T22:17:27.000Z,0

Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling’s phenomenal acting performances really made us think and look deeper into Mia and Sebastian’s characters, and really put us in their shoes. The movie to me, was as sweet as apple pie, and warm as molten chocolate lava fudge. Especially the ending. 
The ending was not what a lot of people expected, but if they were to look at the lessons that it teaches, isn’t that the whole point of the ending? The point of life? You encounter something so amazing that you’d want it for the rest of your life, but you also have to give up another amazing thing to get the new one. You meet someone that instantly lights up your world, and you’d want and need them in your life, but you can’t, because your heart tells you that you have to pursue your career that you so longed worked for and respected. You end up facing some difficult choices. Life is like that, and it’s not always gonna be fair. It’s not always happy-ever-after. There are paths in life that will force you to make a decision, and sometimes you’ll doubt if you made the right decision. But that’s life. Not everything will always be your way. The important thing is as long as you listen to your heart.
Cherish the experience you have: show love and respect to all those around you, and make meaningful memories with the ones you love. Maybe sometimes, it’ll work, maybe sometimes it won’t. Be patient and persevere; when one door closes, another one opens, and you just have to make your own choices in life. And maybe one day, you’ll look back and cherish the memories you have made, the paths you have taken, and the lessons you learned through your experiences. Life isn’t fair, and it’s not supposed to be; and not everything is a happy-ever-after. But it’s all part of the experience, and one day you will look back at these days, at all this pain, and you will cherish it forever. It’s the decisions that we make today that count and shape our lives, and whether or not we also listened to our heart. Life isn’t fair, and you won’t always get the happy ending; but as long as you listen to your heart, and cherish and love those around you, who knows what miracle could drop by your house. You will one day look back, and cherish all the memorable memories you have made in your experiences.",2018-01-30T13:56:00.000Z,5

Jesse-Jane, a small Irish girl who has literally been fighting for years, also has a dream. At home she dreamed of becoming a famous actress in Hollywood films.
When she was 8 years old she was asked to play a role alongside famous actors in a Hollywood film. Other (Hollywood) films and a TV series soon followed; but here too she had to keep on fighting.

I'm thinking this is where all the raves came from about the opening scene, people who actually live in Los Angeles...but then I got to thinking, could I have even sat through this film if I didn't already know and love LA? It's a musical like the Wedding Singer is a musical. Don't get me wrong I loved the Wedding Singer as a teen, but that's about what this amounts to...actually in a way it's worse because it revealed to me that apparently the old white men of the Academy are not only old and white and male, but so brittle and narcissistic that apparently even the struggling actress and underemployed pianist had to be made unrealistically wealthy for this to be a ""happy"" film...I got a news flash for anyone living in Arkansas: if you come to L.A. to look for an acting or music career, you will be living in a house built in the 1930s divided into four rooms which you will share with 15 people, and you will take public transportation.

They do this deliberately to sell the movie to the target audience... averagely attractive females with high standards in men as they are really shallow at the core. The psychology behind this is to make you feel you could get a gosling if you looked a bit better. Then you'll go and spend a fortune on cosmetics and the whole time on your journey you'll ignore men who would usually be a good match for you and you'll end up sleeping with a bunch of guys along the way that had the same body type and or features regardless of the character or principles.,2017-11-19T03:25:00.000Z,0

Why didn't their relationship work out in the end?

""Because that's the way the film was written,"" you say.

Why was the film written that way?

""Uh...""

I'll tell you why. Damien Chazelle chose that ending because he didn't want your usual ""happily ever after"" cliché. He wanted to do something more original. ""Paper Towns"" by John Green is another example of this kind of ending. 

But in a story, no part of it (especially the ending/climax) should be chosen for what it is NOT. It should be chosen for what it is. And I see no way this story is made better by that ending, outside of the avoidance of a cliché.",2017-10-27T01:32:24.000Z,0

It really captures that indomitable spirit of youth that believes that if you want it enough you can make it. The film really is a breath of fresh air that makes you want to believe that life is an adventure and the world is a beautiful place full of hope. Honestly to me the film was really focused on a purity of belief in your passion. That's the thing that bonded the two main leads and its the thing that propelled the entire plot forward. It was incredibly moving and inspiring for anyone who has ever felt like maybe they can't make it or felt that they should just give up on their dreams (so you know everyone).

После премьеры на Венецианском кинофестивале этой картине сразу стали прочить статус фаворита оскаровской гонки. Но если прогнозы подтвердятся, режиссёру обаятельного музыкального ромкома не составит труда без дрожи в голосе произнести победную речь, ведь француз Дэмьен Шазелл не обделён вниманием жюри «Оскара» — в 2013 году его музыкальный триллер «Одержимость» получил три золотые статуэтки. В «Ла-Ла Ленде» снова музыка на первом месте — фильм поведает историю любви танцовщицы и джазового пианиста, отношения которых проходят серьёзные испытания голливудской карьерой.

I hardly ever buy CDs, but this soundtrack was a must have for me. Thirdly, Ryan Gosling is so charming and handsome…I have a weakness for musical boys.

After watching it i kind of realized that sometimes love is all about your dreams and chasing after them, holding on. This film literally inspired me to go and make my dreams of being an actress a reality, and that feeling alone made me want to go down into the London streets (Next best thing to Hollywood) and dance and sing in the theatre lights. The way this film makes people feel is amazing.",2017-04-13T22:37:16.000Z,3

It ruins the film (but this maybe the best trailer that can be made from the movie).  I Don't know why people say this is overated. It's not about the story thats good, its how they showed it. The small not so important stuff thorughout the movie had so much value at the ending. I can't relate this movie to any other ive watched.

This kind of movies a rare specie in Tinseltown make me happy even when people had told me that no comes with a happy ending and if is true hey i love that fact is so M.

But it also seems like the characters think they're in the 50s. They talk, dress and act like they're in the 50s, and all the rooms are designed like the 50s. But the most ridiculous part is how in 2016, Ryan Gosling shocked that Emma Stone hasn't seen Rebel Without A Cause, a 1955 film most people today haven't even heard of, let alone young people like them. And no cinema today would play it. I know some cinemas sometimes play classics, but Rebel Without A Cause isn't a classic, because most people today haven't even heard of it.

Los plano-secuencia que logra el director  son impresionantes (¡con razón ganó a Mejor Dirección!), la producción es monumental con una cantidad enorme de extras y bailarines en escena y la música me pareció excelente! Toda la cinta resulta una historia romántica y de sueños que buscan materializar los protagonistas, contada en clave musical por supuesto, que igual deja momentos para la decepción, los fracasos, la reflexión y las vueltas de la vida que juntan o separan a los enamorados. Aunque está bastante almibarada me pareció un muy buen entretenimiento que no se aleja tanto de lo que alguien podría llamar ""la vida misma"".",2017-03-06T19:38:28.000Z,0

I saw this last Friday and decided to check out the trailer for Moonlight. LA LA Land is a fun movie. I'm sure moonlight is probably good and I will likely watch it next. I currently just want something fun. Every movie doesn't have to expose me to some struggle or show me it can be ""darker"" than the last rendition(Lego Batman even made fun of that trend).

Here is what I took from the movie: If you have a lot of experience with old movies, this one will get your memory going as you'll swear you've seen this scene before.  LA LA land hocks from a lot of old movies. Fred Astair, Danny Kay, Bing Crosby,Debbie Reynolds, Rosemary Clooney, etc. There are a lot of little subtle nods. The main actors even dressed in a similar style. 

Don't see it like it will be nonstop singing(Avita, Les Miserables ,Sweeny Todd), nor like Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.  Maybe a little closer to Singing in the Rain, for song and dance. I wouldn't have minded just a little more dance. Take your wife, take your girlfriend (not at the same time) and just smile.",2017-03-06T03:35:44.000Z,0

WTF that makes no sense but I guess if you're hot from the ladies point of view then yeah, you can just get away with that crap. oh how about the fact that they said that they don't make movies like this anymore, and they are right, because they suck. What even is the plot, some guy in jazz trying to get his own club and some girl who's all like yeah I'm gonna be an acting star. Not to mention the arsenal of cliches in this movie.

Not compared to the hype around it and the money it recieved.  I'd give it a 5 out of 10.  The singers were good, but not great in this quasi-musical.  Compare it to the singing in Les Mis.  There is no comparison.

The move was also slow.  That scene where they were dancing against the purple background was way too long and boring.  

I know why actors in Hollywood would like a movie about this because as actors, they can relate to it.  But I don't know why it made so much money.  Maybe there is a longing out there for musicals so much so that the masses will love any scraps Hollywood with throw them that has 'high production value' and big name actors.",2017-03-04T15:30:48.000Z,0

Whiplash looks like someone pee all over the screen.  The cinematography in that movie is shit.  It's also a very tension-less movie with a laughable cartoonish performance from JK Simmons.  The writing is so pandering that the acting is really bad.  It's like a very shitty student film that copies off of Black Swan and Full Metal Jacket.  There is one scene of unnecessary shaky cam during the finale.  There's tons of handheld use and not a single use of a crane.  Lazy filmmaking, just fucking bad.",2017-02-28T02:54:28.000Z,0

The liberals and SJWs have fucking ruined it with the silly complaints that La La Land never committed.  The movie is not racist in anyway, you're only making it racist by the way you are thinking.  You are the problem, not it.  This movie in my eyes is a complete masterpiece.  Sure, I can list some plot holes that don't make sense in the narrative, but with every movie comes problems.  While I think this movie is better than Moonlight, I am happy Moonlight won instead of this.  The movie already had its success and doesn't need anymore awards or money.  It made more than enough with 300 million worldwide, a bunch of nominations, and wins from other awards during its run.  It doesn't need the best picture win more than Moonlight does.  I am glad the Academy decided to split up the awards.  Moonlight can have best picture, while Damien Chazelle rightfully deserves best director.",2017-02-27T12:37:09.000Z,69

A subconscious and unspoken stigma and stereotype exists
among movie producers and most people that a film is for children if it is all
about bright colors, simple messages of happiness and verbally expressed joy
through song and beautiful art as well as principles of familiar real life
things that most good people hold as ideals such as young love or honor in
various jobs. Somehow La La Land proves this utterly wrong and rips those
biases utterly to shreds. It reminds us all that color and life and goodness is
what we are looking to see in real entertainment, which is a childlike feature
in all of us, the innocence we long for. It’s balance between serious themes
and dreamy heart make it irresistibly attractive and intriguing. It proved that
old fashioned values combined with art in simple and pleasant forms, as applied
to art, are every bit as meaningful and held as respectful to a huge adult
audience by the 340 million it’s already made. Obviously, it was made after the
way of an older and “bygone era” of films that were classier, more innocent,
more simple, more musical, and more jolly. But I believe it made a masterpiece of
itself accidentally, perhaps because the more youthful producers fill in their
absence of true experience with a bygone genre (the 1920s, 30s, 40s, and 50s)
with their imaginations, that give their forbears the benefit of the doubt in
the way of true quality and meaning, but, who cares? It worked! This film was a
masterpiece among films in my opinion. It proved to me something I have long
believed to the center, which is that part of the glory of being human is to
embrace innocence, and the purer elements of art such as mastery of pictures,
singing, presentations, and dance with honed practice by experienced and
passionate artists…of a kind. La La Land proved to be more than paying homage or
milking nostalgia to some supposedly greater and forgotten era, but a solid and
deliciously indestructible piece of living proof that new and original pieces of
entertainment not only can be made but can make today’s world brighter and more
beautiful by remaining optimistic, original, and true to form in the process!
This movie is gold! It could hold the potential for some kind of modern renaissance
of worthwhile art in many forms. It didn’t make me long for the past, it didn’t
break my heart, but it didn’t let me away easy either, it didn’t leave me
critical, it didn’t leave me without a smile on my face, it didn’t leave me
content, but it didn’t leave me unsatisfied, it gave me just that right balance
of entertainment to not only pleasantly distract me away from the woes of real
life but want to get back to it and make something more of it, and that is
meaning! It left me wanting more true art in other forms, and if a movie can
pull at my inner humanity like that, it’s masterful enough to be called an
original masterpiece, if there ever was one. Like other great movies like Star
Wars, somehow it just hit the spot with the perfect balance of just the right
things; drama, color, comedy, originality, simplicity, easiness of
understanding, heart, a touch of fantasy, a touch of realism, plenty of romance,
seriousness, a little sadness, small aspects of uniqueness, and not overdone in
any of those qualities. For this reason it should stand the test of time. What
a wonderful film. I standards have been raised.

Five out of Five stars.

It's a chick flick intended for Ryan Gosling fans and soap opera lovers. The achievement is maybe more on the ""Artistic"" side, not on the narrative side. The story progresses very slowly, and I kept asking myself - what did the director was trying to say... 
And that is ok, just please don't compare it to classics like star wars or more appropriately - Musicals like ""Hair"" which is a master piece on its own rights. 14 Oscar nominees ?! hard to believe. I did like the two main actors - they played pretty good, but this movie has to decide what it is... a musical, a romantic film, a get-after-your-dreams movie, an artistic feat  ?

Let alone Emma cheated on her boyfriend when she first met Ryan. 

If you think about what Emma did, she doesn't deserve a guy like Ryan AT ALL.

Let me explain myself:  I mean i know that Ryan and Emma are no professional singers. They can hold a note but if you want a film to be categorized as a musical shouldn't you cast people that don't sound quiet so mediocre like you just recovered from a sore throat and were asked to sing? The dance routines were a little too mickey mouse for my taste and for a musical it didn't have a lot of significiant songs. ""City of Stars"" was nice the first time, okay the second time and after the third time i was just annoyed. It was pretty much the only song the whole film had.",2017-02-04T20:46:11.000Z,0

On one end it paid tribute to the MGM musicals with some of the director shots and that captivating ending (Through the fury camera shots I instantly thought of that 18 minute fantasy break in ""American In Paris"". But their neat trick is that they used REAL LIFE MOMENTS. Excellent.) I appreciated that aspect of it, as well as the plot, which detailed a unique covenant exchange.

The only negative I have is, while I loved the chemistry between Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling, I wished for more from them in terms of song and dance. If you work with them 3-6 months longer than they might have, you have dance routines akin to Rogers and Astaire. (I felt the choreography was not tight enough) But that's me 1) wanting perfection or 2) actually ""holding on to tradition as opposed to moving into the future."" - get it?

Overall, the movie was inspiring, as it effortlessly blended a drama-meets-romance plot with musical.  It deserved the many Oscar nominations it received because of its imagery and originality and it was one of the best movies I've seen this year.",2017-01-30T09:52:42.000Z,0

It deserves to be seen in theaters, better yet it needs to be seen on the big screen because that's how it reaches full potential on the big screen. I'm likely to begin reporting all these spams because I'm sick of all the illegitimate viewers cheating the system. Sometimes movies have to be seen, who know for some great films it's actions like putlocker that puts potentially magnificent directors into poverty due to lack of box office results at their magnificent films. La La Land succeeded, but others show be given a chance to receive money to watch. It's a shame how many people don't care but I'm sick of it!!!!!!",2017-01-29T06:10:37.000Z,0

There were a few scenes of creativity (the ending for one) but not enough.  Interestingly, I saw this movie around the same time Debbie Reynolds passed, and watched clips of Singin' in the Rain, with performers who can actually sing  and dance, with memorable catchy music, everything a movie musical SHOULD be.",2017-01-29T00:34:12.000Z,0

It gives that feeling of nostalgia, yet it sets a spark of something new. I honestly was watching the movie with a heavy heart solely because of it, and I was shocked to see a 50's style format from such a movie within this period of time! The romanticism of aspirations and dreams caught my attention the best, being both a dreamer and a hopeless romantic. Also, the casting made it even more comfortable for the plot. This is, I think, the third time Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are paired together in a movie, and that made things easier for me to picture as if everything was merely a memory of some sort. With the colorful sights of LA and the stories of two dreamers clashing into each other, I think this is the best movie for me so far within this year.",2017-01-28T09:10:11.000Z,0

The great thing about La La Land is that it really grows on you. Specifically because the soundtrack is so addicting!!! Once I play a song I have to put it on repeat a few times. The film takes a pretty normal story-line and adds a modern tone to it. It's very refreshing! :) What really makes the film stand out is the sheer amount of effort put into it ... especially in regards to soundtrack, costume design and cinematography!

1. Plot. Nobody watches a musical movie for its plot. But it is unforgivable to conjure up a clear oscar bait with a plot skimpier than Kim K's g-string and as formulaic and unimaginative as Trump's combover. 
2. Music. You can forgive the plot but can you forgive the music since it's a musical movie? None of the tunes is memorable and the score is inferior to even that produced by an amateur funeral band. 
3. The singing. Where do you even begin? We know that both leads are not known for their singing or musical talents but Ryan Gosling's singing can only be described as Kermit warbling in pain when Miss Piggy is not available for the night. At best. 
4. The casting. Gosling clearly looks very uncomfortable throughout the movie and within 20 mins you get a clear sense that he's not even committed or even bothered and he just wishes this nightmare to be over. And Stone? With her resting bitch face (RBF) she would be effective in roles such as the scene-stealing one in Birdman. But as a delusional, campy, act-cute, wide-eyed girl next door with a RBF? Give me a break!! You know something is seriously wrong when John Legend with limited scenes is your best actor. 
5. Lack of chemistry between the co-stars. Let's just say that there's more sexual chemistry if you put Trump and Hillary in the same room. On the same token, it's also more believable for Obama to hump Kim Jong Un than for the leads to get it on. 
6. Dialogue. The script seems to be written by a pre-school kid with mild retardation or a drooling Kanye upon receiving a full mental exorcism la A Clockwork Orange. 
7. Pacing. I snored. The lady to my left snored. The uncle behind me snored. Within 20 minutes. Doesn't help that most scenes are almost akin to that created by a Z grade producer of a third world tourism promotional teaser. 
8. Mandatory conflict scene. It's as intense as a spoilt child having an existential crisis over the fact that he was fed more yellow peas than green peas. 
9. Magical mysticism scene. Ordinarily it would look funny, playful or creative. Here it just looks juvenile, awkward and clumsy. 
10. Ending. Unique and clever and surprising? Nope. Just lazy, manipulative, pretentious and plagiarised hogwash.",2017-01-25T18:40:11.000Z,0

The songs, story, acting, etc. were all great. The set designs were INCREDIBLE and most of all, I felt like I was just watching two people in front of me, it did not feel like a movie. It also did not feel like a 2 hour movie, it felt so much faster and kept you entertained the whole time. It is whimsical, depressing, cathartic, old fashioned and inspiring all at once. Lastly, I really liked the ending. It was definitely a more realistic ending. I would definitely see this again and recommend it to everyone!",2017-01-23T04:43:04.000Z,0

My broken heart is going to take a long time to heal.

They did this with Brokeback Mountain, Prime, Titanic, Me before You, The Best of Me, Casablanca, Atonement, Becoming Jane, Gone with the Wind, Blue Jay. How many more heartbreaking romance movies have to exist????? In this horrible world we live in (not always horrible, ofc), we already have so much negative stuff happening in the world. Watching a beautiful romance movie with a non-heartbreaking, happy ending where they end up together would allow us all to leave this violent, hateful world temporarily to enjoy this beautiful fictional world. WHY WOULD YOU END IT LIKE THAT??? JUST GIVE US THE CLICHES, idc how annoying and stereotypical it is. I understand this movie was making fun of cliches in Hollywood romance movies how all of them have happy endings, but SO WHAT. Couldn't they have been ironic in making fun of that notion by MAKING it a cliche ending? SO many real life romance stories end well and the couple stays together/stay married for 60 years!! It's not THAT uncommon!",2017-01-23T02:25:14.000Z,0

Or any of the Jacques Demy musicals.  Or, see ""The Band Wagon.""  Brilliant to say the least.  Also, the theater in which I went to see ""La La Land"" features weekly showings of old movies.  Yes, I got to see the preview of ""Silk Stockings"" with the legendary Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse.  Ha!  Eat your hearts out Ryan and Emma.  Incidentally, I could only take 20 minutes of ""Whiplash,"" the director's last work.  What's that old adage?

Then mentioned to my manager she felt uncomfortable when im around her after the only thing i did for her to maker sure she was happy because she complains about everything so i did try to make her her job easier because i love when she is happy and smiles because everything goes the way she  wants. Because of she mentioned to someone to the person that was  jealous i was stepping ahead of him effortlessly he told the main corp what she said then i lost my position as a manager and they cut me my hours almost got fire still she was the one mad at me when she was the one who woke my feelings without the intention of loving me . All the management stuff moved her to the morning time and me to the night time and i only see her one day but i don't get close to her lately she started to talking  to me again the one day we work ! i just want to remember the day she offered me to take me home after i lost my brand new car in a crazy accident  and how we used to spend hours talking about everything and how she  smiled at me and  don't want to go even if her girlfriend was calling her she wouldn't pick up  her girlfriend's call and cried to me then let me held  her hand  and me saying sorry  and she saying it is ok and smile at me and telling me how she felt lonely here in California that she misses her family  !!!

We have our own production equipment. As you know, digital equipment is cheap nowadays. We've made five movies for cable as a family & friends endeavor.  

We are working on a musical script now. We have all the songs. That was easy. Now we have to do stuff like lipsynch the songs and do a LOT of cutaways and montages because we don't want to screw around with sets. We had hoped to make it a Broadway musical. But it would be a LOT easier to make it as gigantic montage series of scenes.

this is how I perceive the ending. As we see in the ending montage, if seb would have gone with her to Paris, his chicken in a biscuit would have been more popular and would have taken the spotlight off of Mia. We see this when they go out for the date night, their house isn't as good as it was with her real husband. Mias overall dream was to make it big. Sebastian's dream was to also make it big, but mainly he wanted Mia happy. He knew that if he went to Paris with her, she would not have gotten her dream so he made a sacrifice and let her go. At then end when they smile at each other, she realizes what he did through his song. In the beginning of the movie he said that jazz told stories and conflict. They also both said they would always love each other, and they still do. Mia realized at the end what Sebastian has done for her to get her where she is today and then they let go. That was just my theory on it but overall great movie!",2017-01-16T03:16:28.000Z,1

The evolution of the musical from Bessie Love and Broadway Melody through to present day and a promising look to the future thankfully avoiding the cliche of ""Glee"".

Twixt all this recognition of its adolescence fruition it tells a modern romantic tale believable and fraught with twists worthy of West Side story and indeed Romeo and Juliet. I can understand the universal acclaim but it seemed to me very much a film makers film and therefore valued by those who value the Art.

and the MUSIC...wow...i honestly didn't expect at all that the music/soundtracks is all going to be really THIS GOOD,.!!  👍 👍
it's mostly jazz/jazzy, broadway, as well as dreamy classical which kinda reminds you of the old-classics ""Singing in the Rain"",. i really LOVE all the music soundtracks in this film/movie very much!!  👍 👍
 ..it's been a LONG while to see a 'musical' genre movie like this...that also really moved me, & deeply touched my emotions, warm/warmth, as well as imaginations soo much,.. . . !! :')

My cousin who saw at the second viewing said as a musical it was bland, there wasn't enough musical numbers,the opening number felt out of place, the dancing sucks especially the tap dance sequence a lovely night, singing was mediocre, however she said the songs were good though. She further said as a romantic comedy the plot was thin, there was no character development, emmas' acting was overrated, ryan gosling was weak, she hated the epilogue or ""what could've been"" sequence she thought chazelle was trying too hard to show that he should win the oscar. tbh I liked the movie, bu after seeing how the audience and how two different people who saw I the movie at two different times hated it, I wonder if the critical acclaim from the youtube comments are legit or they were paid by the film to promote it.

The tunes were unmemerable. If I do think of the score/songs, I'm trying to actually remember them than already humming it. However, City of Stars was quite good. Perhaps a bit over-used, and the first introduction on the pier felt odd and out-of-place. Like, where did it come from suddenly in this film after the previous scene(s)? Same can be said for all other songs, which really are not many at all. 

It's a nice romantic drama film to watch and nice to see both actors together and as their characters. They are quite loveable and cute together. However it was another unoriginal story of struggling actress and musician meet and fall in love and follow dreams together, either ending up successful together or alone. Luckily, their chemistry and warm scenes together make it watchable and not overly distracting.

Maybe the point of the film relates to it's own characters. Trying to be a revolutionist instead of traditionalist. Maybe ""La La Land"" is trying to be revolutionary and fresh instead of a traditional musical by simply being a romantic drama featuring musical numbers - doing something new than straight-forward and a checklist. But even then, with a part satire and realism of the Los Angeles world, including traffic and constant sun and warmth (that film funnily needed to show time pacing by listing the seasons) it still doesn't come across as anything groundbreaking.",2017-01-10T19:25:48.000Z,0

SPOILER

Wow, what a twist with that scene when she walks into a restaurant and see him play. Then he got fired and walks towards her. In that moment I had this trailer in my mind, so I thought he would kiss her in the middle of a sentence. That would be shit, actually, totally out of the blue.

A movie full of SURPISES that combines the prefect proportion of comedy, romance, drama, with some incredibly raw & moving performances. LA LA LAND also displays a very unique film production style, breath-taking sceneries and an over-abundance of amazing talents. Every song transports you to new places, every dance makes you want to dream and every scene leaves you full of WONDER & MAGIC. 
In my opinion, saying that this movie is ""Good"" would be an understatement, this movie is indeed an outstanding nerve-wrecking and emotional MASTERPIECE. One of the rare movies that brought tears to my eyes and overwhelmed me with an intense and constant overflow of feelings. This movie erased the clear distinction between emotions, leaving you speechless and full of uncertainties.
INSPIRING! I highly recommend this movie as one of the best movie that anyone could watch to perfectly start the new year.",2017-01-03T22:47:45.000Z,1

One of my favorite shots from the movie was when Sebastian was playing the piano at his sister's engagement party and the camera slowly zoomed in on him. It reminded me of the kpop music video by Taeyang called ""Wedding Dress"" where he played the piano at his ex girlfriend's wedding. 
Overall a fantastic movie experience, hope this movie can score Best Picture at the Oscars!!!",2017-01-09T04:51:41.000Z,1

It was like torture to sit and watch all singing and dancing with no great story behind. I loved the movie ""Sound of music"" but this movie was not for me. No disrespect.

I'm not somebody who falls for hype of any kind when it comes to movies and I think too many are oversold as ""best film of the year.""  I saw La La Land the other day and was disappointed, quite frankly.  The songs aren't memorable and if you subtract the novelty of these two movie stars singing and dancing you basically have your standard boy-meets-girl movie.  It was inconsistent and I was bored in a couple of places.  And I HATED the ending - I found it depressing.  The upside - Emma Stone's acting was great and Gosling's piano playing was remarkable.

It is very simple if they don't do exactly what you want when you file a claim, forget about hiring a lawyer. You can simply hire a public adjuster who will work for free on a contingency basis. And get you exactly what you want. 
 AND...wait for it...
Simply file a complaint form at the California department of insurance, which will cost you nothing!! 
CDI will quickly put State Farm in their place and make them pay for everything on the claim and it's free, the governments dept of ins has  FAR more power than anybody else to enforce state farms pathetic cheapness to pay out especially if you have a claim for home damage (auto as well).

State Farm does not want to have bad records (that stays on their record and effects their yearly review and lowers their AM rating AND IT ALSO GETS PUBLISHED IN THE STATES CONSUMER COMPLAINTS STUDY on their Dept. Public Website) with the State Dept.  that's why they will pony up.

If you're a movie buff like me it pays homage to old movies, riffs on Jazz, pursuing and never giving up on your dreams, finding your love and losing them...and the eventual trade-offs as we move on with life and outgrow certain parts of it. Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone definitely more than shines in this glorious movie. Definitely the BEST MOVIE of 2016. It's very French...very ""Umbrellas Of Cherbourg"".
You'll notice all the ""old movie references"" in the way it's shot like An American In Paris,  Casabkznca, etc.

These two performances were fantastic and they sure have a lot of fun for their life going experience of what they really want for their own dreams. The songs were dazzling and boy, hearing these songs that you can't get out of your head. Yay, take that ""Frozen"" with ""Let It Go"" song which people think is cool, but here I can remember them as I can tune my jazzy songs while hearing them in my iPhone. The dance scenes were fun, the real sequences were beautiful and so colorful, and it was an amazing musical film. Like most of the audience since musical films didn't have much potential, but you're watching a fun musical experience. I can't believe this movie it's a huge hit from critically acclaimed people and I'm one of them that no matter what it's a movie classic for the next future. Go check it out people, it was beautiful. One of the best 2016 and I'm not going to say this, but it's easily on my top 10 favorite films that this one deserves it.

I went to see it today only because the movie I wanted to see was sold out and it turned out to be one of the best cinema experiences of my life.

2016-11-03T14:00:00.000Z,0pdqf4P9MB8,La La Land (2016 Movie) Official Trailer – &#39;Dreamers&#39;,"La la Land is just amazing. It cured my insomnia and sent me to la la land literally within minutes. But why? 
1. Plot. Nobody watches a musical movie for its plot. But it is unforgivable to conjure up a clear oscar bait with a plot skimpier than Kim K's g-string and as formulaic and unimaginative as Trump's combover. 
2. Music. You can forgive the plot but can you forgive the music since it's a musical movie? None of the tunes is memorable and the score is inferior to even that of Nocturnal Animals' (music is not even its key selling point). 
3. The singing. Where do you even begin? We know that both leads are not known for their singing or musical talents but Ryan Gosling's singing can only be described as Kermit warbling in pain when Miss Piggy is not available for the night. At best. 
4. The casting. Gosling clearly looks very uncomfortable throughout the movie and within 20 mins you get a clear sense that he's not even committed or even bothered and he just wishes this nightmare to be over. And Stone? With her resting bitch face (RBF) she would be effective in roles such as the scene-stealing one in Birdman. But as a delusional, campy, act-cute, wide-eyed girl next door with a RBF? Give me a break!! 
5. Lack of chemistry between the co-stars. Let's just say that there's more sexual chemistry if you put Trump and Hillary in the same room. On the same token, it's also more believable for Obama to hump Kim Jong Un than for the leads to get it on. 
6. Dialogue. The script seems to be written by a pre-school kid with mild retardation or a drooling Kanye upon receiving a full mental exorcism la A Clockwork Orange. 
7. Pacing. I snored. The lady to my left snored. The Uncle behind me snored. Within 20 minutes. 
8. Mandatory conflict scene. It's as intense as a spoilt child having an existential crisis over the fact that he was fed more yellow peas than green peas. 
9. Ending. Unique and clever and surprising? Nope. Just lazy and manipulative and pretentious plagiarised hogwash.",2016-12-13T17:01:40.000Z,0

That's why I'm hyped for this.

Chazelle is a talent to watch for... (Especially if the film has something to do with Jazz)",2016-11-05T03:48:51.000Z,55
