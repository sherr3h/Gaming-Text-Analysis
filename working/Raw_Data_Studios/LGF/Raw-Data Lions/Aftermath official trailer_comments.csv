What a disgusting movie! Represents the Germans as victims! Fact is that every nation is responsible for its government if it has not been forced upon it by others. Thus, the German people were responsible for its government. If this government makes war and crimes are committed, then the people are collectively responsible. The German people have collectively benefited from the food robbery in the occupied countries, while other peoples had to starve, Germans collectively did not need to go hungry at the same time. The other stolen goods from occupied countries were collectively usede by Germans. The slave labor also benefited the Germans collectively. From the robbery and murder of the Gypsy, the Jews and Slavs the Germans also benefited collectively. What was stolen from them benefited the Germans, including their labor. The remnants, that is, the utilization of the corpses, also benefited the Germans collectively. Whatever was collective, the lack of collective resistance. Whatever was collective, the collective lack of compassion for the victims by the Germans. The Germans were also punished collectively, e.g. by bombing. In sum, the Germans have collectively participated in the crimes of their Nazi government and have been collectively punished. Germans were responsible for all war dead and their own! Aftermath? The fact that the German people were in solidarity with their murderers can be seen from the fact that the prosecution of the Germans against the murderers was completely inadequate ... The Germans after the war have covered the German murderers ... So they themselves are still a people the murderer defines ...

And yet nobody says a thing about male actors who typically star in period pieces. Like, direct me to the last time someone whined about Daniel Day-Lewis in ""yet another period piece"". No, instead everybody puts their heads way up his bum. Nobody is out here whining every time Jason Bateman plays a bewildered straight guy in ever freaking movie. Keira Knightley picks roles that offer challenge, women who aren't just ""strong women"", but who have faults, doubts, make mistakes.... oh my God, and they're in other eras. Someone call the police, dear God. I swear your lives will not end if Keira Knightley continues to be in period piece movies. You'll all survive.",2018-10-17T04:57:42.000Z,174
