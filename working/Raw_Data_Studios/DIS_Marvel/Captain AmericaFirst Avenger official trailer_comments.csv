2011-03-21T19:01:51.000Z,JerVrbLldXw,Captain America: The First Avenger - Trailer,"Steve Rogers - the weaker vessel, compared to Peggy - he is visually, weak, in the physical sense.  But here also seen to be strong spiritually - he does not walk after the flesh.  It is written that sin is in the flesh - that is why people experience the lusts of the flesh.  It is more difficult for the woman to crucify the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof than it is for the man, wherefore she is called, the weaker vessel.  The Bible is seen with the ears and not the eyes.  Hearing is seeing.  They who misinterpret scripture to go forth to do evil are damned, going into their graves unrepentant.  Devils believe that God is too, but do they repent?  The only thing mysoginists and eugenicists ""feel sorrow for"" or ""feel sorry for"" is themselves, going to prison, going to hell, but do not sorrow concerning their victims, not for the harm they caused, wherefore they are damned though they say Lord Jesus or wear crucifixes or do other such acts... Hope of Salvation, does not mean certainty, but hope... A tree must bare fruit, or it will be hewn down and cast into the fire.. all gone?  Wood yet remaining?  ""I am Groot"" ... this one, yet lives... hope.",2017-04-25T06:17:40.000Z,0

2.) Steal ideas? Um, no, jackass. We're a MELTING POT. That means people from all over flock to us. We don't steal, we assimilate.

3.) Racists? We might bicker among ourselves on a day to day basis, but every culture on our soil will UNITE, when pushed, to show the world why we are the Home of the Free and The Brave.

I completely agree with the last point that you made. You notice how superhero films have just exploded onto the big screen over the last 10 years? The combination of amazing technology and a whole industry full of dedicated people have been able to bring classic characters to life. Just look at the films coming out this Summer.

When I said they ruined it I was obviously talking about my own taste. I don't like it so much when they go back and tell the story of the beginning because they usually take too long getting to the action and the fun part of the story. I prefer Captain America after WWII. I never read a comic book in my life but I know about ALL of the comic book heroes/villains and I just want them brought to life in cinema.

Hugh Jackman as Wolverine? Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man? Edward Norton as Bruce Banner? Chris Hemsworth as Thor? Do you want me to go on? There is a chance that Chris Evans might be the worst superhero to ever be seen on screen; there is also a chance that he will be absolutely amazing.

The United States weren't always united. Back before July 4, 1776 the United States were just America. Or the 13 original colonies. That's why people today still use the term America. It's not an informal title and shouldn't go in parenthesis. America is just another name or a short lazy term for the United States of America. If you are from the US be ashamed.

If you notice Howard Stark, he's at the same age as Steve Rogers (or maybe Steve is a bit older). They're probably in their 20's during the World War 2 (1940's), so the producers hired a young actor to play Howard Stark. If you've watched Iron Man 2, Howard Stark (John Slattery) made a video about the Stark Expo in 1974. That makes Howard Stark around 40-50 years old.",2011-03-27T10:04:29.000Z,0

The movies done by the Marvel Studios matter not the ones by the companies like FOX or SONY that owe some of marvel's property, like fox owning the X-men ,or Sony Owning Spiderman. I wish that all the licences would go back to marvel, especially Spiderman and Wolverine, because Spider-man should be in the Avengers, and Wolverine as-well , but  wolverine should have also made an appearance in the Captain America Movie as part the Canadian allies. which means allot to Canada eh",2011-03-25T08:11:26.000Z,0

At some point in the story Captain America gets frozen in suspended animation and wakes up in our time when he is found by the avengers.  There was also some comments about him looking to skinny in the beginning.  Again if you read the old comic books they totally got it right.  From what I can see right now it looks like they did it right although I don't know what they are going to do about NIck Fury.,2011-03-25T07:57:50.000Z,0

also iron man 1 was set in 2009, because he drove the audi r8 2008 in the movie. iron man 2 is set 6 months after it and he is driving the audi r8 2010. so iron man 1 was probably set in late 2009 and iron man 2 is set at the time the movie was released.",2011-03-25T06:59:53.000Z,0

ya you're prly right.
movie takes place during WWII (1942)
gotta just assume mr. stark is prly like 20 in this movie (its a stretch i know)
tony stark is prly 38ish in iron man (2008) meaning he was born around 1970
make it a 28 year difference. 28+ 20 = 48 years old when mr. stark became a father
pretty much the only way this makes sense

You may want to look up goliath tracked mines which were remote control minitanks that carried an explosive charge. The Germans used them to disrupt infantry and blow up stuff on the field of battle. Problem was they had to be controlled by wires so if the troops didn't have anti-tank weapons they had to risk going ahead of the moving explosive and cut the wires while bullets are being fired",2011-03-25T01:29:17.000Z,0

I knew a trailer would surely change my view. I didn't know much about the Cap. like I know someone like Batman* and on paper he doesn't seem to be up to much beyond being able to fight with a shield. And peak physical strength is given nowadays. But that was mighty impressive. I mean I knew very little about Iron Man until the movie and that was freaking awesome so this might be a similar case.

Yep as others have noted that is Howard Stark. If you watch the recent Avengers cartoon series Cap. America picks up a photo with Bucky, Howard Stark, Captain AMerica in the Avengers mansion and recognizes Howard Stark who is Tony Stark's father. Capt.

It looks better and more realistic then just having the costume from the comic books brought to the real world. His comic book costume would look ridiclous if brought to life plus would the military design such a costume for a battle soldier? No the movie one is what the military would roll out for a soldier who is supposed to be an emblem. He can still be camoflauged to a certain extent and wouldn't be a huge target on the battlefield.

Yeah often times certain things that work design wise in a comic book wouldn't look good in the real world. The Blob, Juggernaut looks good in the comics. Real world they don't look very good. CGI often times doesn't give a very good feel or look compared to models/puppets. Don't get me wrong it has it's place and can be used effectively especially when combined with models/puppets guy in a rubber suit.
