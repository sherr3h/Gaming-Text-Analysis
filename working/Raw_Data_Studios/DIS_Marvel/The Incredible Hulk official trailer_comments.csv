2013-11-16T00:58:58.000Z,xbqNb2PFKKA,"The Incredible Hulk (2008) Official Trailer - Edward Norton, Liv Tyler Movie HD",The reason you think Ed Norton is a boring character in this is because he is acting depressed. What would you feel like if you had no control over a monster that you hate and want to get rid of because it’s ruining your life. That’s the whole point of this character. That’s why I think Ed Norton’s portrayal of the hulk is much more realistic than Mark Ruffulo’s,2018-05-01T13:03:57.000Z,1

We all have sinned and fall short to God's infinite glory. Those who do not put their faith in Jesus will continue to be spiritually dead, will go to hell and will have eternal separation from a holy God. But those who have faith in Jesus will have eternal life in God's kingdom where true love, peace and joy dwell, and will will be made spiritually alive. You can't save yourself from your sins, only God is able to save and forgive sins, Jesus is the only way to heaven. I use to be bad, I lied, stole, committed sexual immorality and other bad things but I started to read the Bible and the more I did that, the more my heart and life began to change. Out of the love, grace and mercy of God I am saved, not because of anything I have done. I was deserving of punishment. Jesus promised to give his Holy Spirit to all who believe in him and now that I have the spirit I experience the love and power of God everyday and it's beyond human understanding:) The Holy Spirit would guide you all the days of your life. God would always take care of you and never forsake you, he would always remain faithful to you. God would comfort you in times of need and help you in any area of your life. God loves you so much and wants a relationship with you, your so special in God's heart. God loves everyone equally but the love he has for you is like your the only thing in all existence that he loves. If you have questions about Jesus or want me to pray for anything I'm always here for you. Also I have a video called God loves all:message, if your interested. God bless your hearts and I hope you have a great and wonderful rest of your year!:)",2017-07-09T02:23:50.000Z,2

I am a huge Hulk fun and when I saw it I really enjoyed it. I mean. They had a great romance. A great Hulk and Banner. A great Ross and great battles. The performances were really good. My only problem is that they made Abomination into a generic Resident Evil monster. I would prefer a more modern design of his original form. Still awesome film though. Great soundtrack. 
I believe that the dark and moody design of the film that came on the same era with Ironman probably demotivated people and this didn't get the praise it really deserved.

Looking forward for Mark Ruffalo to nail the role in his own solo movie. He has the same respect to me as Norton. Good job Marvel but step up your game. Hulk needs his solo film.",2016-05-16T21:25:48.000Z,0

what most of us can agree on is the Eric Banna/Ang Lee Hulk movie was God awful.  Banner was bad, plot was weak, Hulk was cartoonist. .....

this movie ranks waaaaaaaay higher on the scale than that version",2015-09-07T05:13:19.000Z,0

Shouldah just adapted the Hulk: Ultimate Destruction game. Covers much of the same territory, doesn't hide the Abomination until the very end, and also has a kick-ass boss fight with the Devil Hulk which would have been killer.",2015-09-07T01:53:47.000Z,3

Godzilla is a great example of this format, where the movie's main attraction is the monster's fighting. That seems to be the best way to portray the Hulk. Remember, it's not so much about suppressing the hulk anymore, as Bruce has somewhat learned to control him for the most part for the better. 

We know Samuel Sterns has become the Leader and is now locked up with SHIELD. Have Bruce be studying him, trying to maybe repay him as part of a neat emotional subplot, and he decides to try and make Hulk his weapon. When this attempt fails, he creates a monster that can defeat the Hulk, say kidnapping General Ross and making him Red Hulk or any other assortment of monsters in the Hulk comics.",2015-05-13T11:08:37.000Z,0

2003: gamma irradiated dogs were kind of corny.
2008: no great leaps from the Hulk; (the first film nailed this, having the Hulk make mile leaps over the desert terrain) an awesome ability of his.
