I get some people found it boring, slow, or whatever, but I very much liked the the tone the film went for as a Shakespearean superhero drama film. It's well acted, the characters are memorable, the music brings me to tears (Patrick Doyle is such an underrated composer), the pacing moved rather smoothly, and there were nice bits of humor sprinkled in among many other things. Now does the film have flaws? Yes, but so do most movies. Personally I would have loved to see a montage of Thor and Loki's adventures over the years growing up, and a lot of scenes cut from the film should have stayed in because they actually added a lot more to the characters.",2017-11-02T22:29:00.000Z,85

I think the only difference is the implied intention. If they made African gods white, people would complain that it's white supremacy. But when they see a cast with actors from different ethnicities, then it's good since it's diversity.
And since no one considers themselves to be ""Norse"", no group's offended. ",2013-10-20T03:22:21.000Z,0

But the producers chose someone who was good for the role as well as keep the cast diverse (yes, that's a factor). Moreover, they knew the fans wouldn't care so long as they get a good action movie. A lot of movies, especially completely fiction superhero movies made from comics, aren't meant to be historically accurate.

Also, they aren't making a mockery of the Nordic Gods, the reason they wouldnt make a movie about the christian God is that the Christians/Catholics take things a bit more to heart, I, for one, believe in Nordic Gods and this isnt a mockery in my view, Thor's tale is along these lines,",2012-06-03T20:05:17.000Z,0

And for your information, I'm not prejudiced against Slytherins. I LIKE the Slytherin house. In fact, I get pretty disappointed, especially at the beginning, that the author treats them so unfairly. It's clear that she starts by portraying them as bad guys. Anyway I sidetracked. I'll respond in the next comment.",2012-05-10T11:45:35.000Z,0

Because the impression of the house is going to be based on that - the characters that are introduced to the reader. If the author chose to have most of the bad guys come from that house, then naturally the author is giving the impression that that is a bad house (at least relative to Gryffindor).

I'm a Slytherin myself and from a Slytherin viewpoint Gryffindor values are foolish. ""Daring"" and ""nerve"" is what got Sirius Black killed. The world isn't all rosy.

Hogwarts has 1000 students - we only get to know a minority of all of them. Harry is the main character and in Gryffindor and he is destined to fight an evil Lord. Not surprisingly Harry runs in circles with Gryffindors who fight for the Light.

Although it was directed by Kenneth Branagh, he is best known for his Shakespearean background, so the manner of story-telling is quite old-fashioned.  But story-wise, and acting-wise, it was excellent.  I espesially like the performances of the actors who played Thor, Loki and Odin.  Two thumbs up.",2011-12-16T07:38:52.000Z,0

The Bible says in Proverbs 20:6.  Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness. Let‚Äôs see if you qualify as being a good person. Have you ever told a lie? Have you ever stolen anything, irrespective of its value? Jesus said, ?I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart? (Matthew 5:28).

Actually, when the movie was in production, much discussion in the fan community was about how the horns would translate into film. Even in the comics they look pretty silly, but I thought they worked pretty well in the movie. Please, give the comics a try :) They're pretty good right now.

That being said, you aren't supposed to find Loki attractive. Even in the comics, Loki is usually drawn as being pretty plain, especially when compared to Thor.

Heimdall:""I can't let you in"" 
Thor: ""You have to""

Marvel is doing this with all their current superhero theme movies, a teaser after the credits are done. DC is slightly different as they placed their teaser in the middle of the endling credits, as they did with Green Lantern.

This movie is much deeper than Dark Knight. Its characters are complex and Thor is a character you really feel for. You see the good and potential in him even when he is being a war monger. And unlike the new Captain Kirk he really does earn his powers and rank back through self discovery and hard work.,2011-06-20T17:57:42.000Z,0

First off, where is Hugin and Munin?
Why does Mjolner look like a regular hammer?
Where is Jarngreipr?
Where is Sleipner?
Why isn't Loke a giant?
Where is Balder?

And btw, I think they mixed Niflheim and Jotunheim, cause Niflheim is the realm of cold, and Jotunheim is the home of the giants.
Oh and btw, Ragnar√∂k (where Thor and Odin dies etc) would start when the first giants were to cross the Bifrost.

Besides, in movies they've had white actors play famous Asian historical figures (such as Genghis Khan) and play Asian deities, such as the actor for Raiden in the ""Mortal Kombat"" movies being white.

You're nitpicking THAT in a movie about a supernatural superhero, who is in fact some old Norse god? Why would a norse god of thunder become a modern day superhero at all?

Also, it's both a commercial and a critical success so it seems others enjoyed the ride and didn't nitpick stuff that doesn't make sense in something that don't make much sense to begin with.",2011-05-31T00:47:03.000Z,0

Sure, they altered a few things here and there, such the idea that Loki was a full-blooded Jotun and not the spawn of Odin and a frost giant, but as far as origin movies go, they didn't do a bad job. Not only that, but the interpretation of Asgard as sort of a futurist floating city in the cosmos was inspired, and necessary, considering the other half of the movie was spent in Bumfuck, New Mexico.

Well, Heimdall WAS the 'whitest of the gods', and that's why I think it was actually a wise decision to go with an african-american actor. If they put some really pale dude in there, someone would probably say it was racist (that's how people are). But we've seen enough pale dudes in film recently. Some white supremacists were upset about the casting, but that's to be expected.

yea thats true, but the vikings in Denmark and along the coast of sweden and Norway really have that much contact with the sami in the high north of scandinavia?

and if you look at mj√∂lnir pendants, they are usually very magnificent and detailed... and furthermore, if they make everything look ""cool and modern"" and take the entire norse atmosphere from norse gods, then they could at least give the hero a cool weapon.

My beef is not with anyone for saying it was wrong to make heimdall black, because as a thor comic book fan myself from back in the day, even I had my reservations about it. (Which actually worked out okay) What I didn't like, are all the silly examples given and the racism that came with it. So I became a devils advocate so to speak.",2011-04-29T12:49:21.000Z,0

This sort of casting has been done before and is nothing new. Raiden, the Japanese God of Thunder, was played by a white dude in a movie called Mortal Kombat.

Many people thought it was stupid back then as well. It's just the Internet didn't let people voice those opinions so easily.

The truth is: If you think that the only reason someone could think the casting was stupid was because of racism, then you are the one who is closed minded.",2011-04-29T11:37:59.000Z,0

You people are such hypocrites. Whether it is due to lack of intelligence or moral, it is no surprise that racist hypocrites like you are twisting the point, which is that a country with a vast majority of Whites lacks the Non-White numbers to make it illegitimate to cast Whites in Non-White roles. The other way around, however, it is clearly institutionalised racism. There actually is a people that makes up the basis for the mythology used in this film.

Yes, White Countries! Whites actually do have countries as well, you racist hypocrite (I am not going into a Negro-debate, because it does not matter what you call the Negros as it will catch a negative connotation at regular intervals of 20 years anyhow). This brings us to the fact that it is only natural that a country with a vast majority of Whites produce movies were Non-Whites are played by Whites. In such a country, on the other hand, the reverse situation is clearly racism.

I like Idris Elba. He was amazing in The Wire. If Thor was black or asian or whatever, then I'd be complaining too, but Heimdall is way different.
Besides the film is based on the idea that the Norse gods were actually real. If they were real, they would rule over the entire cosmos, not just Scandinavia.

Yet, you people frantically complain about Whites playing None-White roles in movies produced in White countries. You people are such hypocrites. In fact, this underlines the suspicion that the decision, to have Negro play a Norse God in such a high profiled and high budget movie produced in a vast majority White country, is purely political.

If anything, all I see are stories and events taken from the comic books, which obviously aren't going to translate 100% into films. I'm really surprised this film goes the Jack Kirby route instead of pure fantasy, really. And this movie is made directly by Marvel, so comic writers have some input.

Batman Begins and The Dark Knight took a lot from Year One and Long Halloween. Ed Norton Hulk is based on Hulk: Grey. Cap America is very much a Brubaker Cap. etc.",2011-04-19T22:07:42.000Z,0

Jewish or Israeli people are not real Biblical Israelites they are imposters Rev 2:9. Anybody who follows ( black/yellow/white)  the religion Judism is Jewish. Read the 13th Tribe by Arthur Koestler.

I don't think anyone at Marvel, or anyone outside of scandinavia, knows of this particular group actually. To most of the world the worshipping of Norse gods is long dead. So you can't really say Marvel set out to insult your beliefs, they simply have no idea that such a belief still exist today. This version of Thor isn't new either, it was created for the comics way back in the mid-20th century.",2011-04-19T02:46:23.000Z,0

Being made up? That's not being very  subjective.For example Islam is a religion founded by the teaching of Mohammed. Is it pure fiction or truth? All depends on your beliefs but there is no question on the writing on this man that Muhammed is middle eastern and if there was a movie made of him I would be angry if they cast some Swedish looking guy to play him. Just like Muslims the Nordic's had there own religion and unfortunately there gods were not black.

Myself, the marvel superhero movies have all been entertaining (Iron Man especially). Superman sucked, and I don't have much hope for the other DC superheroes. But Batman (the Nolan one) has been the only superhero movie I've seen where I've stepped out and thought that it was among the top movies I have ever seen.",2011-03-27T13:20:32.000Z,0

My only point was that Batman, although it's DC's only legit offering, has proven to be the only superhero character to be properly portrayed in a great Oscar-contender type of movie. I guess if I were to use a sports analogy, I look at it like Marvel has 12 Olympic silver and bronze medalists, while DC only has one athlete and his name is Michael Phelps.",2011-03-27T13:17:40.000Z,0

The Gods never wanted unnecessary war. Certainly something that could threaten their existence -like how Odin and even Thor did just about anything possible to avoid the coming of the final war of Ragnar√∂k.

Saying that Norse mythology is just about war and nothing else is simplifying things very much. Yes you had to die in combat (or at least be a great warrior) to enter Valhalla. But there was not burning hell awaiting regular people. Good people enter Gimli after Ragnar√∂k.",2011-03-21T19:35:45.000Z,0

Marvel's Thor is rebellious especially against his father and pretty much turns his back on his home for an earth woman (Jane Foster). And Foster isn't even white in some of the spinoffs of her character. This is not a historical retelling of the Norse mythology. It is an original story by marvel using Norse-myth characters!,2011-03-13T21:06:37.000Z,0

The guy end up getting fucked up & tortured @ some point just because that dumb bitch did something stupid. The guy always gets fucked over because of some bitch...for the love God just give me one movie where the hero fucks a lot of women and doesn't have that shitty cliche moment where he falls in love with some whore",2011-02-25T01:10:39.000Z,0

Therefore Santa can be any color.

So let me get this straight, sir. You have a problem because a black person plays a character that you have never ever seen in your lifetime. You believe that the Norse gods are all white and that a black person playing a role in this mythological pantheon is an insult to your ancestry. So for you, a character is as shallow as the skin color, am I right? But then, let us not forget that all works of the arts are open for interpretation and portrayal regardless.

In classical mythology, Odin and Frigga correspond to Osiris and Isis, just as Thor and Loki are kindred equivalents to Horrus and Set.

Many religions are old. It doesn't matter.
 I guess it's a bit silly to have a black person play a character based on a norse god, seeing as those were all caucasian ( or for those picky about the definition of 'caucasian', replace this word with ""white"" ) except for the sake of being politically correct about not excluding black actors ( deep sigh ), but it's no reason to feel your religion is being insulted. How often is christianity insulted? And there are more christians.",2011-02-12T17:41:16.000Z,0

Among the 6 biggest religions, what is your source for that, I can't seem to find it? It's an interesting fact to be sure, I was not aware it is still worshipped by so many. Regardless, why o why take offense to an actor in a movie of a fictional world in a comic?

Jesus the man didnt spread hate and war. Greedy and selfish people have corrupted the system for their personal gain. 2. Saint Peter was nailed to an inverted cross because he didnt think that he was worthy enough to be crucified the same way as Jesus, so an Inverted cross is actually showing humility before god.

There is no part in the Bible where someone was told by God to write a book called the bible. Its mans accounts of mans encounters of what they believed was God. K? I'm not saying I don't believe in God, but many stories in the Bible were made bigger and more impossible over time. Like David and Goliath. I'm sure David got smaller and Goliath got bigger.

Asgardians spend their time fighting one another, training themselves for the coming of Ragnarok.  Olympians wear freaking togas and eat.  Asgardians wear kickass armor and carry powerful weapons.  Olympians send their minions out to fight for them.  Asgardians are warriors and fight for themselves.

I wouldn't say I dislike 3d. It's how I view the world in real life. 3d has served me very well over the years. It's definitely right up there with my favourite number of dimensions. And if a person wants to see a movie simply because it's in 3d rather than because the movie looks good, then that's their choice. More power to them.

Yeah I know it's still up to the people who watch the films to make the decision not to watch crap. And plenty of films that come out in 3d are great films. In those cases I just think, why flaunt the fact that it's in 3d at all? If it's a great film, let it speak for itself and let that fact that it's in 3d be neither here nor there. Exclaiming that something is in 3d just makes it seem to me like they are trying to polish a turd.

Yeah alright, calm down. I can appreciate 3d itself, provided it's done properly. But what bugs me most is that it's just such a gimmick. They aren't making all these movies in 3d because it makes seeing the movie a more immersive experience. They are doing it, because everyone else is doing it. It's a big ol' cash cow. That's why all the trailers make such a point of telling you ""IN 3D!!!"" at the end. We end up with crap films making a lot more money than they should because of it.",2011-01-08T13:16:22.000Z,0

MLK was a real man who stood for something with true meaning and deserves our respect for what he achieved. Casting a white man as him would be distateful and insulting to him and his efforts, yes that film would be bashed.

Thor is an adaption of a comic book based from norse mythology which makes it fictional. Just so you don't get confused again, fiction is not representative of fact or the truth but of somebody's imagination.

If a real black or asian man lived amongst the viking, and could fight in battle, he would have been welcomed and respected by his clan members.

I know, I was gonna make that point too, they didn't even have the means to make the norse gods segregated because they didn't know there was more than one ethnicity. But, even if they did, I have a feeling they still wouldn't be all white, because the norse gods are already multi-race in a way. Some are vinir, some are aesir, Loki is technically a giant, and Heimdall himself is a god who occasionally bones mortals, so that is like an interracial relationship right there.",2010-12-21T23:36:22.000Z,0

No, that's not what I'm saying... The character is white, racism aside. It'd be just as bad a miscast if they made him Asian, or Hispanic. For example, in Avatar: The Last Airbender, a lot of the characters were white while it's pretty obvious that the characters from the cartoon were Asian...
