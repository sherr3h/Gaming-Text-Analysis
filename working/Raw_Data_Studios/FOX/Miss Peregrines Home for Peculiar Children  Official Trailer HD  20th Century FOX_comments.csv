Everyone's complaining about how they switched Olive and Emma's peculiarities, but I understand the reason they had to. There is so many more things they can do with Emma's new peculiarity. Olive's age disappoints me to, she was so young in the books and now grew to be older in the movie. Bronwyn's age changed also, having her been older in the books.

This traumatized her so much so that everything about her, the kindness and warm, dissipated into nothing but bone chilling coldness. Her heart died along with those children. They died but she continies to live.
Over the years, she abadoned taking care of the house and the nature took over it, tranforming it along with the rest of thr land into a one uncared forest. Miss peregrine herself transformed too. What was once a beautiful wing of her bird form changed into one black, giant pair of wings behind her. She grew horns and her behaviour changed.

Hi guys, I loved this movie sooo much and have been praying for a sequel ever since I watched it in 2016. You won't believe me, for the past 2 years every single week I would check for any news hoping desperately for a sequel. It was rated decently on IMBD and definitely had a nice box office turnout, so the financial assurance is there. I just wanted to say straight away, I'm quite annoyed at the very least of the people complaining about how the movie is bad because it's not like the books, NOT EVERY MOVIE HAS  TO EXACTLY MIRROR THE BOOK. For God's sake...it's called an ""adaptation"" for a reason and I love it. 

The opportunity is clearly there, although I can't remember the books exaclty I think they can make a sequel based on the original book trilogy, following with 'Hollow City', or definitely the new trilogy ""Map of days"" - based on the blurb it seems to be a perfect sequel to the events of the movie and thus can easily be adapted.

Down to the point. I have prepared a petition to directly mail Mr Tim Burton himself, I just need the confidence that this community we have that is crying for a sequel still exists. Please LIKE to indicate your support to the petition. Hopefully we reach atleast 50 likes in ~2 months. I know it sounds a lot but if you're reading this, all it takes is just 1 tap and you could make the difference to making our dreams come true. It would be great also if you could possibly just COMMENT your socials email or anything so that I can contact you for the petition when we reach our target. I truly believe we can bring Tim Burton's attention back to this movie, but honestly need your support more than ever.",2019-02-03T13:02:41.000Z,1

Miss peregrine's home for peculiar children reminds me of the youth home I was sent to when I was 14. It was once an orphanage that housed many children in the late 1800's. The experience was both haunting and breathtaking. One of the counselors took us to the cemetery to see a few of the graves of the children who had died where I was staying. The only mansion I would ever consider as one of the great's because of it's history. If I was to ever have a dream, it would be to remain a spirit there after I die.

I will give the name and location but it is not a place to randomly visit if you didn't live there as it is not open to the general public.

The good will farm in Houghton Michigan. 

Some of my Best memories were spent living there, the third floor along with the basement was creepy just in general, so I hated laundry day and would run up quickly from the basement when done. The counselors were nice and took us on many outdoor activities. It was one of the most gothic feeling experiences I ever had.",2018-09-26T16:47:17.000Z,0

It's like they literally just read two thirds (or maybe half) of the book, threw it aside and decided to write the rest by themselves. It's an awful, awful mess. It starts off good, a bit rushed but it's still fine, then it starts to make up its own rules and its own plot. Still okay though, I can manage with an adaptation. But then it just goes nuts. Like really, really nuts. There were a part in which I literally started laughing so much I cried buckets (I also cried because I was SO disappointed, tbh). Awful, awful, awful, and such a waste on such a great plot, visions and actors. Shame!!",2018-07-27T23:14:38.000Z,1

I changed it, don't judge. Because when Edward Scissorhands was released on ""December 6, 1990"", when Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released on ""July 10, 2005"" but for Alice In Wonderland it was released on the first ""February 25, 2010"" and the sequel ""May 26, 2016"" lucky before Miss Peregrine got released on ""September 27, 2016"" after Alice Through The Looking Glass. So that's why Alice In Wonderland got 2 movies from 2010 and 2016 it goes in the first place, Edward Scissorhands got a movie from 1990 it goes in the second place, but Charlie And The Chocolate Factory got a movie from 2005 it goes in the third place. Just like the trailer called Oz The Great And Powerful the right words belong in order both movies, like this: 1) Oz The Great And Powerful: from the visionary director of The Spider-Man Trilogy and the producer of Alice In Wonderland and 2) Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children: from the director of Alice In Wonderland, Edward Scissorhands and Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. But they put it on disorder and unorganized, like this: 1) Oz The Great And Powerful: from the producer of Alice In Wonderland and the visionary director of The Spider-Man Trilogy and 2) Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children: from the director of Edward Scissorhands, Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and Alice In Wonderland.",2018-04-21T05:22:03.000Z,0

Granted, there are *so* many differences, but in my personal opinion both the book and the movie are incredibly well done.  Perhaps the movie didn't follow the book exactly, but I think the details added and taken away also made up for a really good piece of entertainment!  They were both so well done, it's so hard to choose which one is better.  Then again, I'm not sure I'd really want to.  Having them both be so wonderful on their on is perfectly okay with me.  Though, to anyone who's read the books and hasn't seen the movie, or vise versa, I highly recommend you watch the movie/read the books.  The differences aren't quite appealing at first, but you'll (most likely) get used to them, and I think knowing the story from both sides is very fun, so in my opinion you should give it a shot. ^^

Jake meets Emma, falls in love, and fights monsters. except in the book Emma has fire and olive can fly. THe book has a lot more adventures and the children struglle to beat the hollows and wughts. In the book they travel a lot more, have a lot more fights, and learn there challenge is a lot harder the closer they get. In the book it's a lot more detailed.

I really enjoyed the effects, however the plot seemed very dull and confusing. It seemed to be 25 minutes of the boring plot then 3 minutes of beautiful creative scenes and then again 25 minutes of the boring plot then 3 minutes of beautiful scenes and this was the cycle until the end of the film. Also, in my opinion, the best scenes and moments were already in the trailer.

First of all the ship was Emma's discovery, second of all Olive is like six! (well technically shes 70 something but you know what i mean).  Third of all Olive cannot manipulate air, she levitates thats it nothing less nothing more. It is a clever ad in but its a pretty big adjustment from the book. the following will be butt hurt fan girl complaints: 1.WHERES EMMA??? not everyone can be included in the trailer but Clair and Olive where featured and they're side characters 2. Why is Fiona's  hair so perfect? (or at least i think its Fiona). For the longest time, she was simply refereed to as ""the wild haired girl"". 3. Why is Bronwyn a little girl? In the book shes like a protective big sister to Claire and Olive. One thing i loved: That Hallow was freaking terrifying! Ok ok im done ranting.",2016-09-28T00:22:28.000Z,0

So many people adore the original Willy Wonka(so do I) but that film made so many changes. I can't think of a film which doesn't depart from the book. Not seen this film yet. I'm a huge Burton fan but I must admit I hated Alice in wonderland. But to all those who say he hasn't made a good film in year clearly didn't see Frankenweenie,2016-09-27T23:37:33.000Z,0

After reading all 3 of the books, this trailer is NOT in the slightest bit accurate. Emma's peculiar ability is fire, they switched Emma and Olive's ability. Which is a big deal considering Emma is this fiery, aggressive teen, while olive is this sweet, bubbly child. Bronowyn is NOT a child, she's a teen. Horace doesn't have a projector in his eye, Hugh is also a teen, not a child, thus his love for Fiona. And forgive me if I'm wrong, but at which moment does Ms. Peregrine leave the children in Jacob's care? forgive me if I'm reading too much into this, but it isn't at all like the book. Also: Hollows are supposed to be slimy BLACK oval like creatures with several tongues, and not at all resembling a human figure.

Fox... serious talk... are you doing this because you cut a deal with Marvel to bring the mutants back to the MCU?  I mean, why else would you do something that's literally just X-Men but with some Tim Burton-y twist to it?

I mean, I guess it's a fair trade-off to get the X-Men and Deadpool in the MCU, but still... come on guys... this is OBVIOUSLY just X-Men... and looking at the comment section, I'm not the ONLY one who's noticed it's just X-Men.  Is this where Young Adult novels are going now?  Instead of ripping off Twilight and Hunger Games, we've moved on to ripping off comic books now?  Are we going to get a man-made peculiarity from some kind of potion that gives people enhanced conditioning?  Is there going to be some magic wave of energy that turns people into giant hulking green beasts?  Are we going to see Gods come down and mingle with humans?  How about somebody with a special suit of armor that causes them to fly and fire weapons?  What about a rival group of people from a school called Mr. Bald's Dormitory for Unusual Youths?

1: The Home is underwater, which did not happen in the book. 
2: Olive did not introduce him to the Home, he chased Emma there.
3: Bronwyn was around 13 if I am not mistaken, not 8.
4: Olive does not have the ability to fill underwater areas with air. She also was about 6 or 7, and wore a headpiece. Her power stemmed from being lighter than air, so she had to be anchored with leaden shoes, which were shown.
- All of this aside, I think the cast looks pretty good, especially Claire and Jake. Miss Peregrine could've been portrayed by someone a bit older, but the movie should be interesting. The special effects look excellent and I feel that Tim Burton and his darker style were perfect for directing this movie.

I do admire the visuals, and even if they so drastically change a lot of elements, it's refreshing to see another book adapted. Often, books are separted from other aspects of pop culture, it's constantly changing.

1. Olive's supposed to be a child not more than 9 years old.
2. Bronwyn's supposed to be a teen like 15 years old and that she's like a mother figure to Olive and Claire.
3. Emma's supposed to be the lover of Jacob, not Olive. Why is she distant from Jacob?
4. Just like Bronwyn, Fiona is supposed to be a teen and the lover of Hugh.
5. And yeah, where's Hugh?

I cri. But I still have high expectations about this movie and can't wait for it to be released to answer all of my questions. :)",2016-08-26T13:42:24.000Z,0

I was looking at this pretty interesting book when my mom said, ""Hey, here's the secound book to Mrs. Peregrines Home For Puculair Children.""

What about her brother, from the first book? And what about Olive? it seems as though Emma now has her ability, plus a few more. Peculiar children are limited to one power, not multiple.

It's so visually appealing but also so cringey when compared to the amazing book. And what people who haven't read the book need to understand is that the children are born PECULIAR not with super powers. I think the trailer does a terrible job explaining that. Their abilities are usually pretty useless in a fight, that's why they have to hide from the monsters that are hunting them. They used to hide in plain sight by performing in freak shows. The reason the boy has to protect them is because his peculiarity is that he can see the monsters. To everyone else they are invisible.",2016-05-22T19:57:51.000Z,0

1. Emma's peculiarity is supposed to be fire, not air/levitation
2. Emma and Jacob went to the shipwreck in the evening
3. Jacob already knew about the peculiar children before going to the shipwreck
4. Jacob didn't meet the twins. (He only saw them on the pictures)
5. WHO IN THE WORLD IS THE KID WITH THE PROJECTOR-EYE?!
6. Olive is supposed to be younger, and her peculiarity is levitation, not freakin fire.
7. Miss Peregrine is supposed to be wearing all black.
8. Bronwyn is supposed to be older and bulkier.
9. Who the heck is that earthbender girl?! Or is she Fiona? Fact- Fiona has wild hair, not braided
10. Jacob didn't use a crossbow to slay that hollowgast. Or maybe they just added that to make the movie look cooler. ugggh

The trailer has so much difference with the book. Goodness.

super exited, i decided to read the books, you know , 'cause the universe seemed super awesome
so i read the first book (in 4 days, even tho i had no time what's so ever)
and now, i rewatch this and i'm like..... what happenned...?
first of all, emma, her power was cool, didn't need to change with olive's
and her, my god, she was one of my favorite character, always so cute and optimistic....
then,they changed thing quite a bit, fiona, her character was my total favorite, with the kind of dreads, the dress and, she was the oldest you know! now, she's a 8 years old who grows plants, and hugh seems to be the same age, no couple ....
they added the ballerinas, but , to be honest, i love them xD so creepy
they changed miss peregrine's age, but she looks more badass!
the hollowgast... not at all how i immagined them.
but, all and all, i'm still exited to see that movie, but, they shouldn't call it miss peregrine, because, in my opinion, it's not quite that =/ (still love tim burton tho :) )",2016-04-28T01:07:00.000Z,0

The strong girl Bronwyn is meant to be an older, bigger girl not a small child, the girl with Jake is meant to be Emma who wield's fire not air but the peculiarity she has is Olive's and she is a little girl that floats, and wheres Fiona's 'wild hair'? (the girl in the veg patch) she has braids instead lol. Well at least i see Claire and Millard.......I mean i don't 'see' him but you all know what i mean lol.

Yes, Emma's ability has been swapped with Olive's. Just to remind you, this is a movie adaptation, and between books and movie adaptations of books, something will always be different.

Thank you for ruining yet another great book series. Changing things that aren't meant to be changed. Adding CGI to things that weren't even in the book. Making a creepy book into some colorful world of BS and it's directed by no other than Tim Burton himself! Wth?! You'd think he'd stick with the story line and make it somewhat creepy and dark but from the trailer I just watched, 90% of it was pure colorful garbage! Thank you. Just thank you.

Riggs best feature in his writing is how well he describes each peculiar child and their attributes.

I suppose they have it setup like an x-men trailer to boost interest but it seems to be confusing people into thinking it is something like x-men. It's not supposed to be. They're not mutants with 'powers' that want to save the world from other mutants. They're just kids with oddities that exist and are hiding. I really hope Emma's fire character is in the films, she was the coolest character. I normally Love Tim Burton, but this film like his last two, looks a bit too campy and Disney. sorry.
Maybe if they started the trailer like the beginning of the book where his grandfather is telling him about the children and he's exploring the old version of the house it would be a bit more unique and pull people in. Then get into the children's peculiarities and the wights. That would be a better intro and explain it in a not so xmen way. I first read the book because it looked so dark and was well written. This trailer makes the film look so mainstream.
I like the casting though. I'm sure the studio knows what they are doing and have multicultural'd it up where possible.",2016-04-13T23:15:57.000Z,0

In comparison to the books it looks like a drag. Also they changed everything from the books. I am happy that they included the clown twins from two of the photos in the book as characters in the movie because I wanted them to be in the books but they weren't besides photos. The sad thing is that a lot of  the beautiful characters from the book are going to disappear by all the people who only watch the movie.,2016-04-06T03:29:42.000Z,0

Tim Burton is a f*cking idiot for replacing Helena in this film (and he's also stupid for breaking up with her); Helena is perfect for this role, she would have kicked it out the park; a role right in her alley! 

And so because of this I am refusing to see this film. And I will be advising others to boycott this awful looking film as well. 

I hope that this doesn't continue because it would be awful if Helena Bonham Carter & Tim Burton stopped collaborating in films because they (along with Johnny Depp, who is also absent in this film) work amazing together.",2016-04-02T13:40:26.000Z,1

I was so delited to hear that one of my most favourite directors is the one who'll make a movie out of one of the best books I've ever read...but I knew something like this would happen...I mean it's something you say ""the book was better than the movie"" but has it become a rule or something...I know it isn't easy...and I don't have the understanding of a film director or something like that..
Why ignoring a total cool character from the book and replacing her with someone who wasn't as nearly as important?
Also: I didn't expect miss peregrine to look like this...doesn't she look a bit to young? I imangined her a bit more mature...ok to be fair...that's just me...but I don't appreciate it...

I just read all 3 books and absolutely adored them. As I read it I imagined this dystopian world with bleak dull surroundings and only colourful traits were the children's abilities. But there's so much colour in this I was shocked especially coming from Tim burton. He turned an otherwise creepy story with unsettling vintage photographs into a joke. The book had so much potential to become a horror based adult drama.Then I was disappointed at miss peregrines character. I love Eva green in penny dreadful don't get me wrong but expected miss peregrine to be older and more strict given away by the photographs. Same goes for brownyn and millard. As for Emma I'm so annoyed they gave her olives power as that would only mean there will be a drastic change in plot. I'd give it to asa butter field to being Jacob as he seems to fit my manifestation of Jacob in my mind from the books, plus he was great in the boy in striped pyjamas. The Hollows features look reasonably accurate but the reality of it was  let down by the comical cgi. Completely killed the thrill factor for me but its 2016 so any hopes of costume or animatronics has been thrown out the window. All in all, not impressed but seems as I can't make judgement from a 2 minute trailer I will watch the film and maybe it will grow on me. It looks good for a children's film but I just expected more coming from fantastic books. Eh.",2016-03-30T16:53:40.000Z,21

3 Book Series Review...
""Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children""
If you are going to read this book, or want to read it before the movie comes out, I highly suggest you read all 3 books in the series. It is more along the lines of one giant book cut into 3. I enjoyed the 3rd book the most and truly wish they would have delved deeper into Devils Acre. I also enjoyed the Capitalist character Sharon who ran his boat tours to Devils Acre.
I don't want to give any spoilers, but I (given my politics) do not really enjoy how the ymbrynes run the show. If they do create more to the series, I hope they truly tap into this. I did not really like it that you had to somewhat wait till the 3rd book to really start to get meat on the bones of the back ground story setting and what not. I also did not like that the antagonist all used weapons, but the protagonist group were just stupid when it comes to any type of weapon. The books definitely have a liberal slant, and I was often rooting for the antagonist group.
They were good reads. If you enjoy super hero, super power, school settings, children in danger, type settings you will enjoy these books.
Hope this review helped you.
Have Fun in Life!",2016-03-27T04:36:39.000Z,1

1.- According to this trailer and IMDB's casting page, Emma and Olive have changed peculiarities, also making Olive WAY older. 
2.- Millard, Fiona and Hugh are much younger, they're supposed to be in Jacob's and Emma's (physical) age range. 
3.- Bronwyn is also way younger.
4.- Enoch is portrayed as old or older than Jacob.

I can live with 2, 3 and 4, since honestly, age doesn't make that much of a difference, however, why would you butcher and then piece together as you wish the characters of Emma and Olive? Emma's peculiarity is on the verge of being a superpower, central to the character, her name, and her history with Abe Portman. Olive on the other hand, is a human helium balloon, she's not an airbender. 

I will see the movie, I am sure I will like it, I mean, the world just looks fascinating and strangely marvelous, Tim Burton's a good director and Jane Goldman a good writer, but how could they possibly believe it would be a good idea to change a mutate a core character and sort of merge it with another? I know novels are almost never translated exactly as they are to the silver screen, but things that change can be settings, ages, etc; maybe even actions, but not characters central to the story. 
I love the novels, they're wonderful, so I do sincerely hope the movie holds up against them, since with only the change mentioned in point number 1 is enough to make it a ''What if?'' regarding the original story of the novel",2016-03-19T23:58:25.000Z,0

2016-03-15T12:59:57.000Z,tV_IhWE4LP0,Miss Peregrine&#39;s Home for Peculiar Children | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,I wanted to read this book and then wanted to see the movie but there is NO diversity in this film and the only black person they showed in the trailer looked evil and menacing. This is a damaging film and unrepresentative towards America...films like this are losing credibility (and money) because ignorant people with money are making films. I was so excited about this film but as a minority I am disappointed and will opt out to see it. It is so damaging and frustrating that minorities are never represented in these films. Diversity is beautiful from the palest Irish person to the darkest African person. It's sad that so many people can't see that and block out so many potential relationships and good friendships because of something as simple as skin colour. :-/ #NEXT! #Back2TheLatestStarWars which has a black male lead AND female lead! #2016...,2016-03-17T06:13:08.000Z,0

Brownie is a boyish looking girl, not the adorable girl in the video, plus, the twin boys are not read about in the book, if I recall correctly, and finally, I am going to see this just because I'm on Book Three of Three in this series, so AS BEING THE FAN GIRL I AM< I MUST TELL YOU I AM SOOOOO EXCITED FOR THE MOVIE!

I'm been wishing for SO LONG this would be made into a movie. But the trailer doesn't look....like the book....Emma's power was she could hold fire so why does she say air??

Yeah, Emma and Olive have swapped peculiarities and that will no doubt change much of the plot to come.  Yeah, the trailer, for the most part, looks lighthearted, not matching the tone of the book at all.  Yeah, some of the ages of the characters have been changed.  And, yeah, Tim Burton has definitely taken some liberties the readers are having trouble accepting.  Here's the thing, though: the author liked it, and fully condoned all changes made, from peculiarity swaps to age changes.  There's no way that was done for no reason at all.  This makes me believe there's a plot twist or the like that will be exclusive to the movie that they both set up together.  I also happen to think the actress shown to play Miss Peregrine will do a great job.  Besides that, I doubt it is going to be very lighthearted.  I just saw a kid holding a crossbow to a Slenderman/tentacle monster hybrid brought forth from the hottest pits of Hell, also known as a hollowghast.  I'm sorry, but that scene looked badass.  Unless that's the cliffhanger of the movie, I'm pretty sure there's a lot we're not seeing.  I'm just going to assume the most thrilling scenes are being saved for the movie.  So, c'mon people.  Let's try being positive.  ""Dark Shadows"" aside, Tim Burton has a pretty decent track record with things like this.  Remember ""Big Fish""?  He can pull this off, he's not complete Hollywood trash yet.  Have a little faith and give it a chance.",2016-03-16T15:30:35.000Z,10

The book painted a really dark image in my head with colors like in Sweeney Todd and atmospheres like in Alice in Wonderland. But this seems too much like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Too campy compared with the source material.

I'm talking about the cinematography and the characters. This was based on a YA book but it feels like it's been toned down for younger audiences. I think that's why. I think they're trying to attract little kids and parents.

Oh well. I'm still gonna watch it just because. And I think it would feel like seeing a new story because so many things are different from the book. I hope it's as refreshing as they make it appear to be. I really really wish it was darker though. Tim has not been as dark as he used to be lately.",2016-03-16T08:30:28.000Z,0

Marketing people want to make a film look appealing to a wide audience and so they edit together little clips into what is basically a sales pitch. Trailers aren't supposed to capture the tone or the 'spirit' of the actual film, they're supposed to get as many bums on seats as possible.
The marketers have probably assumed that fans of the book will go see the film no matter what, and so instead they're trying to get the general public interested with dramatic music, simple gags, cool powers and cliffhangers.
Of course, the movie might turn out to be mediocre, or even not good. It might be a fairly loose adaptation of the book, but a good film in and of itself. That all remains to be seen. What I guess I'm trying to say is, it's a bit early to cry 'THIS MOVIE LOOKS SOGGY AND BAD' or 'BURTON BUNGLED IT'. It's a bit early to cry anything at all.",2016-03-16T08:23:57.000Z,1

However, I was hoping the movie would make it a bit better and draw me in more with the atmosphere, but it only has done the opposite. The actors don't seem that great, and it's clear they changed things, for whatever stupid reason they'll make excuses for.

-Emma's only power should be fire, not air? also what about olive? it's like they combined the 2 characters 
-the loop ""transfer"" is supposed to be through a weird hole in the ground emerging into the loop where miss peregrine's home is
-the loop is also described more grey, eery, and ""war torn"" in the books. the trailer shows it as sunny and happy
-ALSO they call Jacob ""Jake"" when the book clearly called him Jacob!

At first I was so excited to see this being made into a film, and then I realized that they obviously switched the powers around, as well as their roles. Olive is Jacob's love interest? That's just...absurd. I loved her childish nature in the books, so making her older and turning her into the love interest makes me angry. It's been a while since I've read the books (I still have to read the third one) but isn't Emma tied to Jacob's grandpa? I don't want to give too much away, even though it's really not that much of a spoiler, but...I guess they'll be shoving Emma's roles onto Olive then?

I have no problems with that. 3)The Hollowgast at the end looks great(it still could have been better, but at least they're being faithful to the book). 4)My main concern is that Burton is going to ignore the history of Jacob's grandfather with Emma which is definitely not ok because to me that was one of the most interesting facet of Emma and Jacob's friendship/relationship, and a very interesting concept for me when I was reading the books. I hope that this isn't true. Oddly enough I'm not as upset that they've interchanged Emma's power with another's as much as I thought I would be. Slightly disappointing and sort of pointless to do so, but it's overlook-able. But if the film ignores Emma and Abraham Portmans(Jacob's grandfather) past together, I will be very disappointed because I am looking forward to that the most.",2016-03-15T17:42:37.000Z,1

Goes to show how complicated and¬†multi layered childhood trauma is! Obviously Tim Burton had to change a few things to make his mark, but from what I get, he stayed quite true to the feel of this book.
BTW¬†Scrolling down comments... I wouldn't be too worried about this not being dark enough... let's not forget it's¬†about hollows/hollowgasts killing granpa in quite the horrific way and hunting children, not to mention trippy peculiarities...",2016-03-15T17:06:25.000Z,0

Emma can still create fire? On the poster at the end, there's a girl with red hair, is that her? So who's the girl that can control air??

Emma has a power that is unique to the story line. Its what gets them out of some binds, especially in the later books. Her power is also an expression of her personality. I don't like being the person who says read the books, but seriously. Do yourself a favor. The books, as others have said, also have a creepy undertone. Ransom Riggs does a fabulous job of weaving in creepy black and white photos that help with the visualization. It's what appealed to me right off the bat when i picked up the first book and I thought that since Tim Burton was working on this that it would carry over the creepy vibe but it didn't, at all. There is so much brightness and color and not at all like the books described. I love Eva Green so Miss P being so young doesn't bother me as much as I mind (who i assume is) Bronwyn being so young. Bronwyn plays the role of a protector in the books and here she's a little kiddo. And lastly, that was a cheap hollowgast at the end but that's just me being picky. I'm gonna wait to see what others say before spending money to go see it. It might be one for the bootleg files.",2016-03-15T16:41:52.000Z,1

Like I understand plot changes that help pacing and run time and the overall transition from book to screen, but they literally switched around all the kids peculiarities and ages, which literally makes them THEM. Their powers and even their ages (spoiler alert: well their visual ages at least ) are so in sync with their personalities in the books, and they ruined that. Emma is supposed to have fire powers, Olive is the floaty girl (she's also like 6), Bronwyn is supposed to have the super strength and they gave it to they little girl. Why!? Bronwyn is one of the best supporting  characters in the books and is also a mother figure to a lot of the kids, after Miss Peregrine. I don't know. My one hope of this being good is Asa Butterfield.

I can't get over on the swapping of Emma and Olive's peculiarities.

Jake, look up... can you see my knickers now from down there?"" or ""Air is my peculiarity, Jake. I can create tempests out of every single orifice in my body.""  sort of kinda thing...
