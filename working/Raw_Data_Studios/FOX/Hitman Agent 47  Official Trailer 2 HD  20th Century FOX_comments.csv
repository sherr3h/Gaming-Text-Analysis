But after seeing this i dont think the movie will be all that bad, sure it will have a few scenes which are nothing like what Agent 47 should be like, however this is Hollywood! they HAVE to put in some big setpeices in order to feel like they've done their job right. But it does still look like he'll be way more stealth like and 47 like than any Hitman movie before this.",2015-11-19T04:59:00.000Z,0

The movie title is ""The Agent""

The story follows agent 56, a bioengineered supersoldier-hitman just like 47. The movie follows him trying to solve some conspiracy or whatever, figuring out more and more about his past or ""who's behind all this"" and stuff, you know, the classic stuff. But the real twist and fan surprise comes at the end.

So, this Agent 56 finishes his assignment by putting a bullet into a drug kingpin's head. He has figured everything out. The kingpin gave him the last piece of the grand puzzle. He turns around to exit through the door of the drug lord's office . But as soon as he turns around, he gets shot in the head and he collapses. The camera zooms in out through the window behind him to one of the cars on a rundown ferris wheel. There he is, 47. He reloads his bolt action after uttering one phrase: ""so, unprofessional.""

You can't even chew gum in Singapore let alone pull out a gun. You could do other nefarious things I'm not at liberty (lol) to say but you cannot even have faintly erotic dreams about weapons.

instead the focus was on the ""girl"", plot was kindah boring and the scenes werent so interesting, most of the other actors werent that great ( like ""the archenemy"" of agent47 ).

would've liked to see more of his background story, and him going on assassination missions and silently killing everyone with smart idea's, but instead he was shooting everyone like a mad texas ranger most of the time.

potential wasted. it felt like the people had no idea about the game. many details were missing.

i really hope someone else is gonna make a ""HITMAN"" movie again or a sequel or whatever, i dont like that people ""KILLOFF"" a great movie based on a game.

Pros
- Nice action choreography
- Deadpan Snarking
-Zachary Quinto
Cons
-  Terrible Pacing (did bot fell any build up through the movie, just one scene to the next)
- Subpar Acting ( the only person who gets to act emotionless is the emotionless guy)
- Zachary Quinto phoning it in
- Top Villian does the one thing everyone knows he shouldn't do (in the movie)
- Little stealth assassinations

After reading the critical reviews the film had received, I was skeptical. But after viewing this film in all its glory at my local cinema...Never have I had so little faith in critics. So much faith in humanity. Hitman is a beautiful story about the triumph of the will with dialogue so realistic and authentic, it makes Quentin Tarantino look like a retarded chimpanzee with a heroin addiction. Rupert Friend gives such a layered, emotional and deep performance that it rivals Benicio Del Toro in Traffic. All of the critics who have seen this movie burn with a raging jealousy towards the films director, the multitalented editing and storytelling genius that is Aleksander Bach. I pity them and hope that they can someday find the true depth and meaning I have found in this cinematic gift from the Heavens....

The Coen Brothers showed us how simple, quiet and yet so thrilling a movie can be.

But did it really have to be based on the incredibly idiotic Absolution story?

seriously hollywood, if you make a movie based on a game, hire a few people who actually played the damned games so they can tell you what to do instead of making a look alike and drop him in a all out action arena with no plot sense whatsoever.

If you say that this movie is a joke, then don't give the makers your money when it comes out. I don't care if Agent 47 is a ""silent"" killer. You all seem to forget that he was made to be an assassin, not just a sniper. In the real world he could never be as ""silent"" as he is in games because in the games silencers seem to mask all noise, whereas in real life a silencer only reduces the range of the gunshot to a few hundred yards.
