2015-06-08T12:53:29.000Z,Ue4PCI0NamI,The Martian | Teaser Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"Overall a good plot, entertaining and feel good movie. However, the delusional PC crowd went nuts with this one. The celebrity/Hollywood/liberal crowd live in a totally delusional world that will never be no matter how many movies they produce. The producers pushed every PC button on this one. A corn rolled jive turkey hood looking black kid was the brains that saved the day, The Hard nosed Commander not just a woman but a babe who of course has the faithful dweeb husband at home, Making sure they have a complete mix of the ethnic and racial groups and finally of course the mix crew who only saw each other as crewman on a almost 2 year isolation mission? Total BS. If this type of isolated flight was possible the men who were getting laid and those who were not would be at each others throats and one or all the women would have been pregnant. I know this because that is what is happening in our military since they allowed woman in all areas of the military. Especially in the Navy.  I am sorry ladies. you folks as a whole will never be the equal of men in these types of area's and if it was not artificially manipulated you would see very little of woman in these fields.",2019-06-15T12:51:20.000Z,0

It deviated so much from the book, it should have been made in 2 parts.

How about the 24 hours he stayed in the airlock and he tried like 3 ways to make it tumble? What about the storm and how he figured out how to avoid it or the way he lost contact to Nasa?

He doesn't fit in that category.Why in every space movie the crew is so unrealistic, like in this the women are skinny, pretty, youngish, who have time to plug their eye brows in space and draw them with brown pen every morning? Just put some realistic ""astronaut"" looking actors in there next time, will you.This kind of things ruin the whole movie for me.

Trailer showed too much?  :   Yes it showed way too much 
I enjoyed few of the director's movies but this wasn't one of them. First of all..  You are in Mars all alone and I mean.. psychologically,  Mark Watney did not suffer anything. 
One rage was enough for him. I think it makes him a robot.. Everything was great but I was expecting more of suspense and thrill that you could see in Christopher Nolan movies. But this was like.. so light. Remember Cast Away?  wow..  comparing to that, this guy Mark Watney must be a robot. This fact ruined the whole movie for me.. All the feelings that we could have felt with Mark Watney was just gone with some lame disco musics. It was not comedy and it certainly was not suspense movie  ( like interstellar ).
And really..really bad choice of background music... Well..  This was just my own opinion and I am a bit biased to Christopher Nolan movies so I might offend some youtubers and I apologize. but it is just my opinion. If you wanted to see something like Interstellar 
then wait till it goes to DVD.",2015-10-12T02:47:32.000Z,2

2015-06-08T12:53:29.000Z,Ue4PCI0NamI,The Martian | Teaser Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"Why shouldn't NASA have to offer Mars prizes, rewarding (for example) the first companies that successfully send and return humans to Mars? It could be done via:

ChallengeDOTgov

All sorts of Mars-related breakthroughs lend themselves to pro-entrepreneurial Mars prizes, but NASA's (predictably) not offering them. Why not?

Unfortunately NASA's a monopolistic, jealous govt. bureaucracy that feeds off of nearly $20 billion of our tax dollars per year. Its ""workers"" make load$ of money achieving relatively little, and they don't want to upset the apple cart. Innovation's needed though, due to the USA's bankruptcy:

usdebtclockDOTorg 

The status quo isn't getting us to Mars for way too long, and they keep postponing the promised humans-to-Mars date too... The bureaucracy is parasitizing and will continue to do so until we demand better ways of spending our space exploration-related tax dollars.

The Martian was ok... not bad but not great, either. I'd give it 6.5/10. Matt Damon's good in it but some of the other acting was average at best. The script was dull.

The Walk was fantastic. A great follow-up to Man on Wire. The 3D actually added to the movie. Well acted and scripted. 8.5/10.

Firstly it's our own imaginations and interpretations which give the experience you get from a book better. That's why you constantly hear people saying ""the book was so much better"". You have to remember it's only taking you an hour and a half to watch a movie, they need to develop and put the character across to the viewer as quick as possible in such a short time frame,  you either hate it or love it. With the book you get to know the character and see him develop through the story. It will be interesting though to see how it goes, at least it's a decent director that's doing it.

From the trailer, it looks like this film may have solved a lot of these problems. We see shots of Marc, the crew, and Jeff Daniels (Venkat? Talk about white-washing) all looking forlorn and scared which helps provide weight and illustrates how impossible the mission is. It also looks like the airlock scene is kept in the film where his helmet cracks. That might be the best scene. I also hope they do a montage where Marc tricks out the rover to the song 'Stayin' Alive', but then the montage ends when he shorts out the pathfinder.

As you'll see below, some of them handle it better than others. A few are practically itching to go on the expedition, while others clearly... suffered a bit.

Not only is there a correlation with two of the headlining actors, but again there is a Manned (see what I did there?) mission to save an cosmically, and comically apparently, marooned Matt Damon.

Its amzing that one can recognize almost every scene in this trailer, and I want to tell all the poeple who have not read the book and fear the trailer gave away too much, that if the movie tells the story of the book as good as it seems to me then the movie has still alot more to offer than wsa shown here and there still is a very good reason to view the movie.

Also, the order in which the events seem to be depicted in this trailer isnt right. For example the video message mentioned at 1:48 is not actually a message to the crew that Mark is still alive, even though it seems that way in the trailer, provided that the movie is as close to the book as it seems.",2015-07-27T22:59:24.000Z,1

First off, Ridley Scott has been pretty disappointing the last few years .... the last eight to be exact. Eight years since I've seen an overall good film from this guy.
Secondly, Matt Damon isn't a bad actor but he is heavily overrated. I haven't really enjoyed him in a film since ""True Grit"" (2010). That's five years ago.
Thirdly, I felt as though ""Interstellar"" was kind of a let down. Perhaps my expectations were far too high because of Christopher Nolan but I just didn't imagine I would walk away from that film giving it a B- rather than an A+. This film appears to have the same feel. 
Lastly, Kristen Wiig",2015-06-21T20:07:11.000Z,0

0:20 The conversation between Rich and Venkat about Project Elrond?
0:21 The deal with the Chinese National Space Administration?
0:40 Flashback to the storm sequence.
0:48 Mark is hit by the satellite dish
0:56 The desperate gasps sound more like exhaustion gasps from running to get Martinez' suit after the airlock blows.
1:04 Right after he realizes he was left behind and he's still injured.
1:43 Clearly, when Mark uses the _Pathfinder_ to communicate back to Earth.
1:49 The blonde girl is clearly Mindy. The whole sequence is about the _Hermes_ crew receiving the news of Mark being alive from Mitch (Sean Bean).
1:55 I think this is when Venkat discovers where is Mark really heading when they first track his movements through the satellite. One can also have a glimpse on their initially improvised means of communication.
2:33 Clearly, Airlock 1 explosion sequence.
2:43 Mark removing the piece of metal that actually kept him from dying the first time around.
2:46 Probably when Mindy realizes that Mark has to be alive.

An interesting plot about survival and even hope (given the fact that being able to create crops on Mars could mean life on it in the future). However things got out of hand when they took away all interest from the movie: Wondering if the main character will make it. I mean they show NASA receiving his distress call and sending a crew to get him. That is called spoil a movie. They have shown too much by the end and therefore I am less exited about this movie than I was for the first 30 seconds. And to top it all up Ridley Scott directed it. I recon he hasn't been making great movies lately. Now don't get me wrong, it could bring him back into making good movies (He did make Alien) but I am skeptical.

This instinct is found in every culture, without exception.""


Book version of them:
“If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If
 a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake 
levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies.
 This is so fundamentally human that it's found in every culture without
 exception. Yes, there are assholes who just don't care, but they're 
massively outnumbered by the people who do.”

Looks to be a good film.
But this is a crappy trailer.  Virtually none of these shots are sequential, they basically threw the movie in a blender here to stitch together a really cliched trailer that shows next to none of the humor or spirit of the novel.  It even goes so far as to imply story elements that just don't exist in order to force drama.  Damon's character is a bachelor, for example, the wife & kid at 2:22 are those of another character.

Honestly, don't try to take too much from this trailer if you haven't read the book, you'll just get the wrong impression about the film.",2015-06-10T22:59:29.000Z,1

Reading only the first part of this post may communicate (sometimes very strongly) something other than what I'm saying. So please, set aside responding to felt offense until after having read (not skim) the whole thing. Thank you.
<><><><>

I'm a Psychology major, having taken multiple classes in psychology, participated in labs, interact with my professors, and overall study the science. As such, I can tell you:

--- If there is anything that science has shown us, it is that `helping others` is NOT a base instinct. What IS our base instinct is `wanting to be right` and `wanting to be liked`.

Sometimes this manifests as helping others in danger. Sometimes this manifests as punching that jerk in the face. And retaliating to being hurt by hurting back is much, MUCH more common, and more immediate a desire; it is instinctual.

We want to believe that we're good on an instinctual level, but this can only be believed in blind faith. We don't even need psychology to prove the opposite. Our every experience of wanting to respond to being hurt by hurting back proves that our instincts will destroy us.

We all know this. However, we want to deny it.

For some people, the message behind this movie will make it easier to believe that we are ""mostly good"". However, that will ensnare some people, making it harder for them to break the addiction to thinking themselves ""mostly good"", which leads to confusion and mental suffering. I am intimately aware of this in my own past and in the lives of many others.

Let's help one another! Let's try to save people in danger, and heal people who are hurting. Let us fight our natural instinct -- which is `hurting back` -- and instead forgive each other. We don't need this blind faith in ourselves in order to do good. That's a cop-out, and can trap hurting people where they are, keeping them from seeking out the help that they need.

What we need to do, is choose to love.

And when it gets too hard to love, let your weakness prove your need for strength from outside yourself, and go seek it out.

""Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."" -- Jesus, in Matthew 11:28-30",2015-06-10T16:14:47.000Z,2

Just one question. Okay maybe two. Why is Venkat Kapoor, the Hindu NASA scientist and the Head of the Mars program, being played by a black guy? Don't get me wrong, Chiwetel is a class actor. But I was picturing an Indian dude who looked and sounded more like Kunal Nayyar (for some reason) in my head.

(Edit) Looking at the replies to this post, since it is apparently not as obvious as I was hoping it would be - I was joking. I know it's not related to Interstellar. I just thought it was funny that Matt Damon is in this and he plays a stranded genius astronaut, just like in Interstellar, and Jessica Chastain is in this and she's in Interstellar. And Interstellar only came out last year. I was making a joke about. Although it's not exactly funny anymore now that I had to explain myself.",2015-06-10T01:18:07.000Z,28

I felt like i watched the whole movie in three minutes. Essentially it's: Man left behind on mars, nasa covers it up, crew goes and grabs him, everything works out unless it's a dark drama. In which case i'll be assuming the entire time of the film. All the drama and tension just got removed  in less than three minutes even though it's a ridley scott movie. Good job losing ticket sales Fox. I barely have any intention on seeing this.

Other than that, personally, it looks like ""interstellar 2: electric boogaloo"" without matthew mcconaughey but some of the original interstellar movie.

In this trailer they spoil that Matt Damon actually is able to send a message to Earth (would've been an intense moment in the movie if not spoiled) and that the crew back on Earth decides to mutiny and save Matt (would've been an interesting plot point in the movie if not spoiled). Both of these scenes would've had a big impact in the movie, but now that they're spoiled, everyone's just gonna be like ""meh.""

Mark gets seen with a Martian satellite by NASA, and then goes and gets pathfinder to message them better.   Then NASA sent home a message to reconfigure pathfinder so it can send text.  NASA tried to send Mark music (not disco) but that had been too big, I cant imagine video.   This is the book and that is where I think they will not do very good.( the preview made it look like it was in opposite order)  idk if I am right or not, I've only seen the preview :-)",2015-06-09T15:24:06.000Z,4

2015-06-08T12:53:29.000Z,Ue4PCI0NamI,The Martian | Teaser Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"Amazing looking movie...

TERRIBLE TRAILER!

A trailer  is supposed to get you excited... Share the overall mood of the movie.

Not spoil key plot elements. 

This trailer reveals that :

1) Matt manages to stay alive longer then what the MARS ""base"" was intended too by growing plants 

2) That he manages to send a message back to NASA

3) That his crew are turning back to get him and are likely to be the ones saving him at the end of the movie.

Was it so hard to make a simple trailer with Matt being just stuck on MARS and trying to figure out a way to survive? Was it really necessary to reveal all this stuff?

How are we suppose to feel any tension and excitement when actually watching the full movie when we already know so much about how it?

I mean... If this was like the third trailer, at least I could tell myself (Ok, already watched the teaser and first trailer. I don't need to watch more and risk being spoiled).

But this is THE FIRST TRAILER! It's not even a teaser... It's a TRAILER!

This isn't as bad as the latest terminator trailers, but still... They should find a guy who understands that trailers are not supposed to give away major spoilers and stick with him when it comes to making trailers.

The only way the movie can surprise me at this point is if Matt ends up building his own freaking spaceship to get off mars or that aliens come and save him... which are both unlikely.

I am still going to see it, but the trailer is likely to ruin a good half of the excitement I could get out of this movie.",2015-06-09T12:24:52.000Z,71

Was worried Interstellar was going to be the last in my lifetime. Although, even though Avatar was fiction, as was Interstellar, both did well bringing actual science to the game. Even though Avatar had much more theoretical biological science, clearly. Sound in space sadly was and still is a common plague to science fiction movies/games. Kinda kills the mood for me personally when missiles in space battles cause big flaming, smokey, explosions and then everything is on fire including the exterior of the ship. Unless the force field contains its own atmosphere, which at that point, why not just walk around on the outside of the ship without a space suit?

Whatever, the most interesting part of the movie/books to me will be/was the agricultural situation he finds himself in. As a chemistry nerd, Quick fact: the atmosphere of Mars consists of about 96% carbon dioxide. Guess what many plants on earth require to grow...????",2015-06-09T05:20:05.000Z,0

2015-06-08T12:53:29.000Z,Ue4PCI0NamI,The Martian | Teaser Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"The premise of this movie is ridiculous. There is no way a dust storm's winds could be strong enough to compromise a Mission. While winds could get up to 400 km/h (250 mph), the pressure at sea level on mars is 600 pascals (.087 psi) and the pressure at sea level at earth is 101.3 kilopascals (14.69 psi). To give an earth equivalent, the effective wind speed would be a light 2.36 km/h (1.475) on Earth. This is definitely not enough to throw rocks around, as shown in the trailer. The only possible danger would be dust kicked up by the storm destroying equipment, but we have pretty thoroughly solved that sort of problem, as demonstrated by our incredibly long lasting rovers. It would be a pretty crappy mission to be taken out by that sort of thing. source: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars)",2015-06-09T02:04:59.000Z,2

I was afraid Matt Damon was not going to be a good Mark Watney, I was afraid they would not be able to capture the humor of the book (which for me was the best part and set the book aside from any other survival story) and I was afraid they would Hollywood it up, leaving something that bore only a passing resemblance to the book I loved so much..

This trailer has laid those fears to rest. Aside from the sign he used to contact Nasa, I could look at every scene in this trailer and tell you where it happened in the book. And while I wish I saw more funny parts from the book, I can honestly say that Matt Damon is a lot better in this role than I expected, based soley off the trailer.

Sorry to be a pendant, but it is a pity they didn't deal with Mars' lower gravity. If Andy Weir spent a lot of time working out the practicalities of survival on Mars, the fact that 100kg of mass on Mars has the same gravitational force on it as 38kg would do on Earth would factor into the story.

However, for stories to be effective they don't have to be accurate or literal, they have to be emotionally true. The emotional tack of this trailer is promising for the film.",2015-06-08T15:04:13.000Z,0

The trailer is heavy on his crew and the Hermes and their rescue mission. In the book that's a small part towards the end. Exciting but the majority of the book was his alone time on Mars.
