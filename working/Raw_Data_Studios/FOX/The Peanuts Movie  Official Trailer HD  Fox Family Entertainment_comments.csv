2015-06-17T16:01:29.000Z,fVR4E6Q6u5g,The Peanuts Movie | Official Trailer [HD] | Fox Family Entertainment,When the Peanuts movie came out to the theaters. I did go see it. I thought this movie was totally cool & fantastic. The one thing I did not like about this.it was that I thought it was too short of a movie. Well it was only like 1 hour and 35 minutes and that is it. I thought it would be 2 hour movie. Regardless I loved and I enjoyed watching this. I mean come on do you blame me no. it's the peanuts. Then after I came out to the movie theaters I went to Barnes & Noble and bought the peanuts on Blu-ray disc & now I can watch as many times as I want. So since the first Peanuts movie was success right & everybody loves this movie. I was just wondering is there going to be a part 2 to the peanuts or not.,2017-10-28T18:01:24.000Z,0

2015-06-17T16:01:29.000Z,fVR4E6Q6u5g,The Peanuts Movie | Official Trailer [HD] | Fox Family Entertainment,Just saw the film. It exceeded my expectations! Schulz's sons helped produce and write it and they really stayed true to their father's vision and writing style. Charlie Brown doesn't do booty dancing or Skype on an Ipad. Snoopy still uses a typewriter and Peppermint Patty uses a landline. I have to say Snoopy is kind of a scene-stealer; he was hilarious!I It was a packed house when I took my kids and adults and kids were laughing all throughout the film. My husband and kids laughed and some of us even got teary-eyed on one part. Charlie Brown is such a great character. He can't catch a break but he keeps trying to do the right thing. He finally does get some redemption here. He doesn't just get dumped on. The animations is STUNNING! The old gags and old music are still infused in the film. Money well-spent. Can't wait for this to come out on blu-ray!,2015-11-28T15:46:00.000Z,13

2015-06-17T16:01:29.000Z,fVR4E6Q6u5g,The Peanuts Movie | Official Trailer [HD] | Fox Family Entertainment,"Watching this as an adult really made me feel at peace in a lot of ways. So much stress we all face everyday, and watching this in the theater made me appreciate it so much. Including growing up in the 90's and actually appreciating ""Snow Days"" because we ALL went out to play. I feel like the internet, and all things technology has distracted kids so much from what is really fun. 
Snoopy is the most symbolic cartoon dog. Him and Charlie Brown I feel like everyone can connect with. We are clumsy, always trying to impress others yet we find out nobody was even paying attention. Sooner or later we realize WHO is most important to us, and we start to not care about impressing everyone, just ourselves with what we can accomplish. Even if it is just helping someone and being somebody's friend. 
This is PURE INNOCENCE at it's finest. Most ""PG"" movies I see these days are barely even ""PG""...just full of inuendo jokes, and trying to be so hyperactive and all over the place to distract us from the fact there is no story or meaning....THIS MOVIE took it's time, had A TON OF LAUGHS, and even made me shed a few tears just because it is so nostalgic and touching that it made me happy to even be able to watch this when I am almost 30 yrs old. 
I can't lie...I don't have my life completely together, and I want to have kids REALLY BAD...watching this made me wish I had kids to be able to bring them. I hope I can have them soon to give them a good life. It's sad seeing so many kids without a good role model in their life, or the fact they have to grow up in a World with so much ""terror""...I want to have kids to show them that ALL of that is just a distraction from what really matters.",2015-11-27T01:31:45.000Z,86

*The moving truck IS from the Melendez and Mendeleson company
*There is a drawing held in the wall OF the classroom of a Pumpkin patch signed by Linus. (A reference of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown)
*When Snoopy gets his finger caught in the binder it is referencing a scene from the Tv special ""You're not elected, Charlie Brown""
*The winter clothes of the Peanuts characters are the same they wore in ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" but with different colors, probably because of copyright. (For example, Linus' coat was Orange and Lucy's hat was red)
*Unlike the Peanuts Specials, this movie will have current locations in Charlie Brown's neighbourhood. As you can see in the trailer, The little Red Haired Girl's house is in front of Charlie Brown's. In the old Specials Charlie's house changed all the time.
*The Peanuts gang can be seen Skating in the Classic Skating pond from ""A Charlie Brown Christmas""
*Charlie Brown has the same ""War and Peace"" He had in ""Happy new year, Charlie Brown!""
*While Snoopy Is sleeding in his Supperdish he is reading a book about Flight. (Probably because of the WWI flying ace alter ego)
*There will be a Winter dance in the movie in which Snoopy will be the star of the party as Joe Cool.
*Charlie Brown will try to impress the little red haired girl doing magic tricks with a big box at the school's talent contest. (That's Why we see Shermy doing mimic and Marcie doing karate)
*When Charlie Brown spies the little red haired girl through the window, She can be seen reading a LOVE letter (Probably Written by Charlie Brown)
*Snoopy teaches Charlie Brown how to dance for the school dance to impress the little red haired girl. (That's why he dances ""bamboleo"")

I love the Peanuts in the comic version (I read it every day, I have much collections).

The movie (how it looks in the trailer) has almost nothing to do with the charm of the comics.
The trailer looks like a ordinary animation movie like 1000 others.

Look at the ordinary humour, the scenes, the animations: ""Oh look! He fell. Hahaha! So funny!"" ""Oh, he is so shy! Hahaha! - So funny!"" Boring. This are not the original Peanuts. Ok, the graphic style looks cute but that is all.

But I'll watch the movie. But the good ol' times with peaceful and cute moments and wise words are over...I guess...I hope not... Please movie! Don't disappoint me! I have  a big dream.

Aside from hoping it'll live up to the ""Peanuts"" standards in terms of storytelling/characters, I'm also hoping there won't be any (not that great) modern music like most of the trailers have had, and will (at least mostly) keep to the same sort of music that Vince Guaraldi provided with the TV specials (there WILL be man tears if I don't hear the ""Linus and Lucy"" theme at least ONCE in this movie XD).",2015-06-17T16:22:40.000Z,102
