2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"It‚Äôs been a while since this movie came out, but in case someone had the same experience as me and is watching the trailer in 2019, I‚Äôd just like to share this.

When this movie came out my friend and I had just booked our trip to Europe. It was going to be the biggest trip I‚Äôve taken in my whole life. We felt this movie would be a good ‚Äòtravel‚Äô or ‚Äòroad-trip‚Äô movie to get us into the spirit and we weren‚Äôt wrong. I enjoyed it.

Tonight my younger sisters wanted to watch this. I haven‚Äôt seen it in years and when it ended I was overwhelmed with feelings of nostalgia - a combination of remembering the good times in Europe and the sadness of it being in the past. Since Europe my life hasn‚Äôt been the same. I‚Äôve been a little unhappy and I‚Äôve struggled to capture the happiness I felt when I was traveling. 

Watching this movie made me feel so bittersweet because it connected to a certain memory, but the movie itself with the story about friendship, leaving high school behind, bonding with friends before life inevitably changes, and traveling outside your comfort zone made me feel so much at peace. Like people said, this movie strangely enough made you think about life, moving on and letting go. I needed that.",2019-04-18T16:09:54.000Z,0

They didn't try to see the deeper meaning, they didn't reflect on it. Because tbh if you take the story literally and just look for the explicit moments of joy, fun, (maybe nostalgia), drama, comedy etc. Then it's bad. It's not a happy ending, there isn't much of those moments clearly (the movie tries to enhance it to fit a wider movie audience but still). But life isn't like that, I see the book as more educational, a chance to learn. And some people either don't like that or don't see it, thats why I don't think it was a popular film/ book at the time because honestly it was my worst John Green book, and now its one of my favourites.",2018-12-10T20:41:55.000Z,0

It is such boring cringe worthy movie that will make you cringe. The story is so clich√© and predictable, the writing is terrible, terrible acting, filming well looks nice but so bland and no effort put in to and there is no main antagonist in the story to help the climax of the story the characters are so stupid, obnoxious, annoying, forgettable, pointless and generic. Seriously I feel no connection or bond any of these characters. They are just generic high school stereotypes that we seen in many movies and TV shows. I hate Margo in this movie. Seriously the filmmakers tried so hard making her likable runaway scoundrel like Aladdin or Lupin the Third but in here they handled terrible. She is such a douchebag in this movie and she does is doing stupid things and cares less and hates people. It makes me feel I want to punch her in the face. I decide to give this film the Alexis Seal of Garbage. I add this as the number one worst movie in my Top 10 Worst Films of 2015. Even the worse film of this decade!",2017-02-22T23:02:46.000Z,1

I haven't watched the movie yet but it doesn't look exactly like the real story (judging based on the ending scene and the characters). I know they change the story a little bit when they make a movie but they should have used the same exact story for this movie. Don't get me wrong, this girl Cara looks absolutely hot but I don't think Margo had a body like hers (as you can read in the book). Q by the way never directly said I love you to Margo. He 'went with the flow' as they say. And as you read in the book, you would expect that Margo lives in an abandoned kind of city. And at the end, they promise to see each other during summer.

second ,i have this habit of reading the novel before watching the movie ,so when i read paper towns i was super excited cause all the characters are identical to the ones in the novel ,but there was something wrong ,the movie had no details ,the end has been changed ,the entire novel was mixed and matched in a very weird and  ,uncomfortable way ,i was so disappointed with it ,where are the details?they skipped so many things and added some that are  meaningless .
SO read the book first ,then watch the movie ,then and only then you will know how i feel. ....",2016-09-04T01:28:02.000Z,0

I wasn't ok with Angela coming to the trip or that they had such time pressure because of prom. That  just wasn't in the story....

I like this kind of American film, so different to what we do here in the UK.

Is it actually like this? 
Very grey here in the UK from when I was a kid, I am 38 now. School at 8:30am until 3pm, home then play in the street. Leave school at 16 and then either college or a job. Just seems America is so big you have huge options. Nice film.",2016-06-28T00:49:34.000Z,0

I appreciated the ending except one thing which I can't spoil. So I'm disappointed a little bit.

This movie got a bad rating but fk it. I say it is a good movie. These movies makes me wish I had a life like these teens. It really special to make a friend as a child and grow up with them through senior prom.

THE BOOK IS REALLY AMAZING! i love the way that john green writes his books, he's an excellent author. To be honest i enjoy Papertown more than The fault in our stars. But the movie is not like the book, i don't know how to explain it but i didn't feel something special when i watched this movie. I loved Nat Wolff, he's one of the best actors but Cara Delevigne was really bad. The caracter of ""margo"" it's such an important caracter,  it's  really necessary to enjoy the actress who plays it, but i didn't like the way that cara plays. it's one of the things that made me feel disappointed about this movie. But it's was a good time, not a waste of time at all. I LOVE NAT WOLFF, i just LOVE the way he plays! AMAZING!",2016-02-28T13:52:14.000Z,0

Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventurer.She was not some fine, precious thing.She was a girl. It took me a long time to realize how wrong I was. And not just about Margo. I was wrong about a lot of things I used to believe. Everyone gets a miracle.And I still do...

Not like that's a bad thing. There is just nothing about it that stands out and will make me go ""omg this movie is amazing."" You know? If John Green writes a book and then a movie is made it will get overhyped. I've seen and read the Fault in Our Stars too and felt exactly the same.",2016-01-17T16:06:00.000Z,78

I think I was most disappointed at the way the filmmakers went about Lacey and Ben relationship. I completely shipped them and she was so resistant towards him. And I just didn't like that the ending was completely different from the book in a sense. Maybe if I hadn't read the book I would've really liked the movie but I just had such high hopes for this one.

There are 11 things they have to do. Quentin doesn't go to prom, he doesn't believe in prom. Angela never goes to Agloe, it's just Radar, Q, Lacey and Ben. Ben and Lacey are in a relationship. They miss graduation as well. I bet they missed out the bit where he got drunk, I wonder if they put anything in about the Black Santas.

I actually thought the ending was pretty awesome, cause it shows us that life is not a disney movie. Things don't always turn out the way you want them to, and you gotta move on. And that's what Quentin did. I think the ones that commented that they don't like the ending are like 11 or something. (no offense, it's my oppinion) And the ending has a great message: Q had the option to be happy since day 1, but he choosed to wait until certain things happened first. He always had the key to be happy: his friends. But he concentrated so much in Margo that only after she left he was capable to have fun. AMAZING MOVIE.",2015-12-02T00:25:38.000Z,26

Margo wouldn't be happy if she came back even though she would be with q. She'd be living in the town she hates full of people she doesn't really like that much. And most importantly she would remain a paper girl.

1)Its okay but Its not really worth the money you get so excited and then it goes downhill from there.
2) If your a kid like me you wont get the meaning of it unless your a adult.
3)Its that kind of film when you maybe ditch 30 minutes in or something.

Overall rating 6/10

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"She chose to walk alone.
Though others wondered why.
Refused to look before her,
Kept eyes cast upwards,
Towards the sky.

She didn't have companions.
No need for earthly things.
Only wanted freedom,
From what she felt were puppet strings.

She longed to be a bird.
That she might fly away.
She pitied every blade of grass
For planted they would stay.

She longed to be a flame.
That brightly danced alone.
Felt jealous of the steam
That made the air its only home.

Some say she wished too hard.
Some say she wished too long.
But we awoke one autumn day
To find that she was gone.

Some say she wished too hard.
Some say she wished too long.
But we awoke one autumn day
To find that she was gone.

The trees, they say, stood witness.
The sky refused to tell.
But someone who had seen it
Said the story played out well.

She spread her arms out wide.
Breathed in the break of dawn.
She just let go of all she held...

And then she was gone.

( im not saying i am an expert of that area) but it felt like it was trying so hard to look as if something with real significance is going on.

As for those of us who read the book before the film came out, I think the movie was almost frustrating because of the diversion from the book and the abundance of certain iconic parts in the book. (In contrast, a large amount of lines and scenes in the movie are identical to the book, whereas specific scenarios were completely different). But all in all, it's still a decent film and definitely worth a watch. Although, in my opinion, it's still a good idea to read the book. ",2015-07-31T13:48:16.000Z,0

I thought it was a nice, sweet, memorable, heartwarming, and fun movie. Margo being like a paper girl and leaving clues and being a mystery to many people made me think of someone I know. Nat Wolff's character was thoughtful and sweet. I could relate to Nat Wolff's Quentin character not giving up on Margo and staying the course and seeing things through. There are also some memorable lines in this movie. The music is great. This movie will make you want to go on a fun & enlightening road trip. You will think of Paper Towns and Agloe, New York. And you will be thinking of Pok√©mon and wanting a black Santa figurine after watching this movie. Cara Delevingne is pretty. I love her natural full eyebrows. Nat Wolff is¬†a sweet guy.

As for the mismatching with book, at school, she wore a white skirt to her knees and a blue print top.
Another detail they missed is the deep blue rug in the tall building. It's referred to in the ""Walt Whitman's Niece"" song that Quentin finds in her room.

Epic adventures 0:21 What's with the ballet? That wasn't in the book.
She learned how to play the guitar from an old guy who lived in a broken-down house,
And the other one was that she drank herbal tea backstage with some famous band.

Everyone is amazingly cast and I know in the book it says she was curvy but honestly Cara suites Margo perfectly. Even though for some reason I pictured Margo as Roxy Ritcher from SPVTW (idek why) in the book. 


POSSIBLE SPOILER? DONT CONTINUE READING IF YOU WANT TO BE SUPRISED. 

I really hope they include the fact that Margo didn't nessacerily want to be found, she just wanted to be different. Also I hope they include the fact that Algoe (is that the name of the place? I can't remember) is a paper town and is only on a map. 

Ooh and I also hope they end the film the way the book ends, even though it was rubbish it was somewhat beautiful",2015-05-10T13:56:37.000Z,0

What pissed me off is that here on my country, they have this kind of hobby particularly in the bookstores to pull out the books that are being adapt to the big screen. But I didn't gave up and I searched almost all bookstores here on our city which left me disappointment when I can't find a Paper Towns book. They pulled it out away and the only remaining books of Paper Towns are on package where you have to buy all John Green's book so that you can get one. I was really pissed that I gave up and I brought another book. I guess I'll have to wait for this movie. :(",2015-04-18T11:37:04.000Z,0

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"I'm not sure how to feel about this.... I loved the book; it had me thinking a lot, as did 'Searching For Alaska' and 'The Fault In Our Stars' books. I enjoyed the movie version of TFIOS. They did an excellent job for once on that front, but a part of me feels like these movies are unnecessary. They're great books; John Green has outdone himself and created plots with deeper meanings and characters that are relatable in some way or another. But why Hollywood-ize them? Sure, to make money, to enlarge the franchise of these books, to cater to people who don't like reading, and so on. But I find, for these specific John Green books - as well as a few other books turned movies out there - you can't get what the book is trying to make you feel into a movie. I don't know if I'm making sense, I doubt I am. And I realize producers and directors have to make cuts, add things, and whatnot to all book-to-movie type deals. But these John Green books are so much better as just that: books. Why Hollywood-ize something that has so many different meanings to so many different people across the world? You're taking that special magic out of it and putting whatever Hollywood deems appropriate. It bugs me, and this is just my opinion. It's cool that they want to make this into a movie, don't get me wrong. But again, I find it unnecessary for such a book as this. 
Hopefully this makes some sense.

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"I disagree with people writing that ""The Trailer Tells the whole Story"", just as much as with Those who Call it ""Just a typical unrealistic Lovestory"": boy is obsessed with Heavenly beautiful and faszinating girl, they suddenly begin To live and They are all Perfect and so on. 
People with Both Opinions probably didn't  get the Main Moral / philosophy of the Story or haven't read the Book At all. 
The Trailer Doesn't Show the actual ending and Most Important messages and Ideas of the Story, but i think That's good because Like this it Doesn't really Reveal anything .just as in the Book Q romantisizes Margo in the beginning But as the Story Goes on something in his mind begins to Change and he realizes that She is not Like the Perfect picture he Used To See in his Head, but that She has flaws and cracks just like everything Else  does too. Margo is just a normal person, who struggles and Makes mistakes and She May Seem like s miracle to him but She is not more of that than Any other person. 
Through That Q realizes that, even though we can never really become or Fully Understand each other, only when broken and Imperfect and shaped we can truly connect or love others.",2015-03-24T19:43:42.000Z,1

Glasses are not good for your eyes they actually make your vision even more harmed than even before you began wearing them. There is a scheme you can forward to get crystal clear 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someone breaks their arm do they wear a cast forever? Of course not, That part of the body completely replenishes and eventually goes back to normal. The eye isthe strongest muscle in the body so why is it when it is harmed and cannot function properly (Imperfect or blurry vision,) do we wrap them up in a permanent cast? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper measures of care. ¬†Listen everybody, This is ¬†crucially important so please do yourself a favor and go and check this out because it is true you can get perfect eyesight back and toss your expensive contacts and hard to keep up glasses out the window for the rest of your life",2015-03-24T18:02:07.000Z,1

Over time you might have noticed that your vision gets blurrier and blurrier. Glasses are causing your visual cortex to suffer and causes great pain for your eyes they actually make your eyes even more injured, so much so that they become even more damaged than even before you began wearing them at all. There is a tactic you can implement to get impeccable 20/20 vision naturally without the use of glasses or contacts. When someone breaks their arm do they wear a cast forever? No way, The arm heals and eventually goes back to normal. You may not know this but the eye is the strongest muscle in the body, So why is it that when your vision gets bad do they put you in a permanent cast without any hope of removal? The eye CAN and will heal itself if given the proper treatment. Listen everybody, This is so important so please do yourself a favor and go and take some time to look into this because The fact is you can get spot on eyesight back and throw away your contacts or your glasses forever",2015-03-24T03:28:13.000Z,1

I remember thinking paper towns was a lesser version of that book... but i still finished it and enjoyed it. To be honest, I don't remember it strongly, and look forward to having it all come back to me when i see it. If The Fault in Our Stars was any indication, John Green has an ability to choose the right people to adapt his books to the big screen.¬†
Also, I was surprised and pleased to see Cara, as she is so unconventionally beautiful, and perfect for the part. I've never seen her act, so I'm interested to watch it.¬†

But instead of being grateful for them finding her, she reacts to their arrival as an unexpected disturbance and begins to scold them accordingly. Margo had not intentionally left any of the clues they used to find her, and states she did not want to be found. Angry at her lack of gratitude, Radar, Ben, and Lacey leave and spend the night at a motel. Gradually, Q realizes that the image of her that he had been creating was as fake as the one she had been showing everyone else. He grows furious at her for wasting their time and worrying her family but she argues that he just wanted a troubled girl he could save. Ultimately, Q comes to accept that it was unfair to expect her to be more than just a person, and she can't be blamed for being as imperfect as everyone else. After they continue to talk things over, she decides to go to New York City. They briefly kiss and Q wants to stay with her but it's implied that he will return home with his friends in the end, possibly to reunite some time in the future, but it is ultimately left ambiguous.",2015-03-22T18:56:56.000Z,1

Maybe I incorrectly interpreted his physical description in the book, but I remember reading him described as ""olive-skinned,"" which I took to mean ""not white.""
I dunno, I feel like they pulled the same trick that was pulled with the casting for Katniss, who was also meant to be racially ambiguous (Suzanne Collins even confirmed that). Of course, Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress who's more than worthy of carrying the Hunger Games franchise on her shoulder, and maybe the actor who plays Ben in this will be great too, but still...would've been nice to see another person of color in the film :/",2015-03-22T15:55:16.000Z,0

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"There is a certain irony with the people who complain about Cara Delevingne being cast as Margo Roth Speigelman. The book perfectly gives the example of how people judge others or fantasize them and completely misinterpret people's characters or even work. Just because Ms. Delevingne is a super model, does not imply she was picked because she is famous. It's also a relief to know that she has already been judged based on her position and appearance since Margo was the same way. I think she'll play the role fabulously :)",2015-03-22T01:09:47.000Z,1

I hope this movie will match my vision of the novel and be wonderful like The Fault in Our Stars was, which I also loved. I hope one day we'll get Looking for Alaska, which is John Green's best novel in my opinion and my personal favorite out of all of them. :)

I never cared for Naked Brothers Band years ago and I was skeptical at first when Nat Wolff was going to be playing Issac from TFIOS because he was never my vision of the character, but he pulled it off very well. I also hope that he will pull off Q perfectly. Nat defiantly got hot over the years. :D",2015-03-21T15:08:04.000Z,0

I love the character of Q and I like Cara's acting, I just envisaged margo's voice differently, but I'm sure Cara will do a great portrayal and she is pretty much exactly how I envisaged Margo, just with slightly lighter hair as I imagined it to be darker. What I don't want to happen to this film is make it a super cheesy, teenage girl fest. I want it to have some air of mystery, I want it to be dark in some ways, I want all the little quirky quotes and bits and pieces from the road trip in the movie, even though I kind of envisaged it to be more of a caravan.

I found TFIOS to be extremely cliche and uninspiring, thus giving me my pre conceived notions. Sure the book had some interesting ideas, but it never truly expanded on those themes. This book however, was a great read and it was more than just a love story, it was the manifestation of mutual understanding. The story itself was engaging, but the undertones and ideals this book had was what made it remarkable. The philosophies behind the green grass, vessel, and the broken strings really made me sit and think for a while. I never knew John G. was such a skilled writer. I really hope they do this book justice with this interpretation. ",2015-03-20T05:05:55.000Z,1

Why they didn't just cut and dye the girl's hair, or stick her in a wig, is beyond me.

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"I don't agree that Cara is playing Margo. She may very well represent Margo's personality and all you want, but I'm sure there are other actresses who can also do that and being physically more like Margo is supposed to be.

One of the reasons why I like books is because usually their female characters represent ordinary girls like me... Why in the film it can't be the same way?? and when I say ordinary I mean they aren't like perfect-looking supermodels, I thought this could be a good movie to change that, but then they pick Cara for Margo's role and it's a little upset & disappointing!

I have nothing against Cara, instead is one of the few supermodels who I like, but it doesn't seem right to continue idealizing tall/skinny girls like the normal stereotype of beauty... and I think they chose her more for marketing than anything else.

I'll see the movie though, because I love this book and hope they have done a good job :)",2015-03-20T01:38:01.000Z,4

I think Cara seems like a cool person and I'm glad that John felt she was right for this, because I do think there is something about her. Though, it just doesn't seem like it's turned out well from the trailer. I don't know. Maybe that won't be the case when it is released.

I think the problem is Cara doesn't sound convinced by what she's saying ¬†because she's focused on keeping an American accent.

I think the glamour of Cara has actually been toned down too much =D The Margo I imagined from the books was definitely not as down-to-earth or laid-back as Cara portrays here. I'm not sure the idea that Margo is deliberately presenting of a unrealistically glamorous image of herself to Q can be accurately conveyed.

I guess I just want Margo to be more intense, to be more openly idealistic and more desperately unhappy because of it (and all the more attractive to Q) =/¬†",2015-03-20T00:12:53.000Z,1

I get it, Cara doesn't look like Margo at all, but that is completely beside the point. Cara gets Margo. Just look at the way she portrays her-exactly the way I pictured Margo to be. The way Margo looks isn't absolutely essential to the plot. So what if Margo looks like a supermodel? Cara got her attitude, her worldview, her wildness and spontaneity exactly right.

also...Margo barely appears in the book? Can we talk about how great Quentin looks? And Lacey, and Radar, and Ben, and Angela, and just...everything. Everything looks so great. :) :)",2015-03-19T22:47:17.000Z,5

Sure, I imagined Margo has a short, curvy girl, but that was in the book, this is the film; an ADAPTATION of the book, not a full film that's exactly like the book. Also, Cara plays Margo amazingly, would you rather a short, curvy actress who aesthetically looked exactly like the description of Margo portray her, but do it terribly, or someone who perhaps doesn't look like you imagined her to, portray her amazingly. It's not about what she looks like, how skinny she is, if she has the right hair etc. it's about the character. If you've read the book and you've judged Cara for playing Margo, I hope you're ashamed of yourself because it just shows that you've fallen for the materialistic, stereotypical bs that society poisons you with, which is exactly the message that the book is trying to convey across to you - that life isn't about all the material stuff.

Natt wolf is an amazing actor and he is perfect for roles like this (stuck in love amazing)
From the trailer it seems like they stayed true to the book
and i honestly think this will be ten times more enjoyable then the fault in our stars.¬†
First time for cara to actually act in a major movie (im nervous to see if her accent slips)
lastly im a little worried for cara tbh their are so many great actors i pictured for this role nd its such a huge role so i mean i guess we should all just give her a chance. Also if anyones ever seen cara in videos she is quite quirky and thats the part that i see as margo idk

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"IT'S OUT. HOLY GOD, THE TRAILER IS OUT.

I am so excited for this movie - I just, words cannot explain my level of excitement. I love the book so much (along with LFA) and I couldn't wait to see an adaption being made.

I only disagreed with the ways in which the movie already seems different to the book. And the only thing that makes me a little cynical about the movie (like so many others) is the way Margo is described in the books and how Cara (even though I love her oh so very much) is this well known supermodel and it puts down this image people everywhere have of this wonderful, powerful girl - of a margo roth spiegelman who was still your everyday, average looking girl - and who both blended in and stuck out and who loved mysteries so much she became one. We grew up with image, and we loved Margo regardless, because she was relatable and because she was one of us. She was the most beautiful girl alive, Q romanticised her so much in his head and made her out to be the greatest thing living, he built her up to what he wanted her to be, and she wasn't perfect. But she was still wonderful, and we still loved her.

I get it. But honestly, I just think people need to relax a little more about the casting now that it's confirmed, the trailer is out, and the movie is yet to come. It actually looks good, and I have enough invested into this for me to believe that it will be, that it'll live up to my expectations. Clearly there's nothing anyone can do about the whole casting thing, but right now, rather than anything else, people should focus on the actors' acting abilities. John was clearly impressed with Cara's audition, as an actor, not a random supermodel, and I think we should have faith in that.

I do agree that hollywood should cast more girls who actually look like your everyday, average¬†girl¬†rather than the most impossibly perfect looking people alive. That needs to change.¬†

But Cara as an actor? It's new to her and she's testing it out, and I think people should just give her a chance and give her a break already, because what's done is done. Saying she can't play the character before you've even seen her play it is wrong. Saying that hollywood should cast people who are more relatable to the audience, who fit their character descriptions and who remain true to the character - that is what we should do. Hollywood still needs work, forget margo's casting as an average looking girl. We still need representation of every kind. We still need diversity. It's a work in progress, and we should demand that more as an audience.

Just don't hate on the actors before you've even seen them play the role.",2015-03-19T21:09:36.000Z,0
2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"Getting super tired of everyone constantly talking about how Cara wasn't exactly how they pictured Margo. When I heard that she was casted, I'll admit, I was skeptical. But after hearing from John that she understood Margo more than anyone else and now seeing her in stills and this trailer, I truly think she's gonna be great. Enough of the ""she was only cast because she's thin and Hollywood likes thin people"" stupidity! She was cast because she was the best choice for the part. We all know that John is very un-hollywood-ish and would not have endorsed her being cast if he didn't 100% agree with the choice. So we should all just believe that John and everyone else knows what they're doing, and aren't the shallow Hollywood people you all seem to believe they are. Have a little faith!

I genuinely don't think it's a great novel, sometimes boring and not surprising BUT when I see this trailer I know it's going to be great. At first I disliked Cara as Margo as well but I actually think it's great. She's so special in her own way and Alex has just the perfect look in his eyes when he stares at her. He makes her not just bareable but the most perfect cast. Idk I'm looking forward to it üòä I can see her understanding the complexity of Margo Roth Spiegelman.

Sorry but this is bullshit. Cara may not be the margo you wished but the author is John Green and he picked her because she was the Margo he imagined and tried to describe. And i really dont understand you. You are telling society not to judge you by your looks and then you are coming and say 'cara is not good bc she doesnt look like Margo' well deal with it people and dont critise her acting until you see the whole movie ,2015-03-19T20:17:43.000Z,1

From what I can tell so far she's really captured her character even though she may not have the same body type, which shouldn't be as important as everyone is making it out to be. She has the green eyes which were described a lot in the book, which is something people aren't talking about. I think she's beautiful, talented, and a fine pic for Margo. My real problem with this is that Margo seems more badass rather than mysterious and unattainable. But we've only seen a two minute snippet so maybe that came across wrong. But another thing is that the nerdy- ness of Quentin and his friend ( whose name I'm forgetting please forgive me not a fake fan). While needs can be attractive they certainly don't act as cool as these guys did. And while I know the book is about how Quentin thinks he's in love with Margo and thinks he knows her but it turns out he was just in love with the idea of her, I only see romance being portrayed and none of the other stuff. It's too early to make any reall judgements but I'm honestly happy with oh they cast an I'm looking forward to the movie",2015-03-19T20:04:46.000Z,0

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"People are actually complaining about Cara playing Margo? Look, I get Margo wasn't specifically described as ""pretty"" in the book, but Q did find her beautiful, and she was very popular and everyone loved her. I think the reason for casting this girl is to more heavily portray the image of the ""popular"" girl, the one that everyone finds perfect, is so it's even more of a shock when you realize she's not as perfect as she seems. Besides, she's John Green approved. He thinks she can really play Margo, and if he thinks that than we should at least give her more of a chance than just the trailer. And that seems like the only thing anyone's concentrating on, can we just take a second and bask in the glory of how accurate this seems to the book? No? Oh that's right, of course not, no one wants to concentrate on the positives! I for one, am extremely ecstatic for this to come out.",2015-03-19T19:32:54.000Z,2

But base on this trailer, this movie won't even reach to the rankings of The Fault in Our Stars. The Fault in Our Stars stay true to the book so well that it was enjoyable (the actors was great). But in Paper Towns it already seem to have bad acting (and the actors don't look nothing like the characters (Margo)). And the high hopes of this movie after The Fault In The Stars is going to crash.

They all look dull, stale, and lifeless like they're just reading it from the script. The concept or plot isn't interesting at all. The only thing that could catch someone's attention is that this was from John Green. Sadly, that's all you need to get someone's attention. These ya love stories are getting annoying. And don't even tell me that this isn't a love story. Because it is. ""I've been dreaming to go out Margo since I've seen her"" doesn't sound romantic at all? You're gonna tell me that it's about friendship instead? Please.    ",2015-03-19T18:57:32.000Z,47

Well, after all, it's a common sense how the industry tends to focus more on the romantic part than the philosophical life lesson as a whole when it comes to making an adaptation movie of YA novels or chicklit. So yeah! Though it sounds just not quite appropriate how the medias--who haven't read the books--consider this movie as just ""another teen romance"", well it's actually not all of their fault to blame.

That being said I wasn't a hug fan of the book but I also wasn't a huge fan of TFIOS until I saw the movie, maybe I just like movies better. Really glad they put more of Angela in the movie cause she wasn't involved in the road trip in the book, which I thought was lame. Can't wait to see this and what they do with Looking For Alaska.

So many articles today, for example, that were focused on hearing her American accent. BUT I think that's totally ok-- because she seems like she's a great fit for the role! If she brings more people to read an awesome book and see what looks to be a great movie adaptation, so be it.
She's not a typical actress and doesn't have a glamorous look. Ok, she's not chubby and short, as described in the book, but tall and skinny. But she seems to really ~get Margo. I'm excited to see her portrayal.¬†",2015-03-19T17:22:25.000Z,0

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"I was actually excited for this and the much anticipated Looking for Alaska movie, but after seeing this trailer, my expectations are lowered. It looks like after TFIOS's success, John Green and Fox decided that they should make all his book's movies like that. That is not the case at all. Each of  John Green's books are very different, which is one thing that makes him a great author. The style and direction of TFIOS was a good fit with the book I thought. But Paper Towns was a little different. Less of a cutesy and tragic romance, and more of a teen, coming-of-age mystery. After all, the central themes of the two books are almost polar opposites. This trailer makes it look like the filmmakers butchered their source material to be centered more on romance and threw on a style fit for a mostly younger audience. It's still a little too early to tell (and I may be wrong about the direction of the trailer) but this could ruin the movie for me and many others. Looking For Alaska is John's darkest and most adult book he's published. I pray to God they won't do this to it as well.",2015-03-19T16:12:38.000Z,0

In an interview, John Green himself said that the movie is VERY different from the book. He said that he changed the ending drastically and its nothing like it was in the book. He wanted to stay true to the book, but he felt that some aspects that made the book good wouldn't work with the movie, so he changed it. If that's going to bother you, then don't watch the movie.",2015-03-19T16:12:27.000Z,1

Now I get it when John Green said that Cara plays Margo naturally and beautifully. She seems to really get eveything that Margo is in the book! And Nat Wolff, oh my God, how can he seriously play a heartbroken blind guy and then be a risktaker-nerd-dude-just-to-follow-the-girl-of-his-dreams next? He's too perfect for this. I'm not only saying these just because Cara and Nat are like two of my favorite people. But even if I dont know them, I'd still really go nuts over here because they suit the characters so well from the book.

But the real score here is that: after showing me the freakingly best 2 minutes of my entire John-Green-Fan-existence, how am I supposed to wait until July 24?

2015-03-19T13:57:43.000Z,rFGiHm5WMLk,Paper Towns | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"A few things.

1) This trailer gave away far, far too much of the plot. I would be really upset had I not already read the book.
2) The book did an amazing job of creating, then destroying, the trope of the manic pixie dream girl. It's clear that this movie creates it. I only hope it destroys it as well, or it will be a failure. I believe John Green was quite involved in the production of the film, so I'm not too worried about this, but the trailer seems to be all about the MPDG. We'll see once the movie comes out.
3) Based on the trailer alone, the casting was brilliant.",2015-03-19T15:40:18.000Z,0

I think Cara looks like a good actress but it has upset me greatly that a curvy book character has yet again been 'hollywoodified' to the extent that the person portraying her is a (UK) size 6 (US) size 2. People will say 'don't focus on her image,she is a great actress'. I understand that John Green though she was great in the auditions. However, it seems to me that this movie is perpetuating unacceptable societal ideas surrounding women, weight and image. I feel this is especially worrying as the majority of people who will watch this movie will be teen girls like me.

Like, I will probably never be struck by lightening, or win a Nobel Prize, or become the dictator of a small nation in the Pacific Islands, or contract terminal ear cancer, or spontaneously combust. But if you consider all the unlikely things together, at least one of them will probably happen to each of us. I could have seen it rain frogs. I could have stepped foot on Mars. I could have been eaten by a whale. I could have married the Queen of England or survived months at sea. But my miracle was different. My miracle was this: out of all the houses in all the subdivisions in all of Florida, I ended up living next door to Margo Roth Spiegelman.‚Äù. It is the best!!!",2015-03-19T14:53:24.000Z,0

4- is it me or wrapping the car didn't happen in the book? 
5- when she came to his window she had paint on her face, no paint now! 
6- unlike the book, Radar's girlfriend came with them, so i'm guessing there will be changes in the bedroom 1 and bedroom 2 thing
