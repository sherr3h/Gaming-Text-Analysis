Keep it quiet for the cameras
Don't let them see you cry
Don't let the people know that you're dying on the inside 
Turn to your husband
He'll remind you to smile
You only have to be in that dress for a little while 


Oh Mrs. Kennedy
What are you thinking dear?
Remember to be happy
Don't you ever shed a tear 
Oh Mrs. Kennedy

Be strong for Caroline
Be strong for Jack
You can take your makeup off
When we get back
Your sunglasses hide
The pain in your eyes 
Just play nice and
You'll be fine

Oh Mrs. Kennedy
What are you thinking dear?
Remember to be happy 
Don't you ever shed a tear
Oh Mrs. Kennedy",2017-07-04T01:01:36.000Z,1
2016-11-14T17:54:09.000Z,g9pW3B8Ycc4,JACKIE | OFFICIAL TRAILER | FOX Searchlight,"I look forward to seeing this film. Portman locked me in as a fan after 'Black Swan,' as if 'The Professional' wasn't enough of an endorsement.

I just finished Vincent Bugliosi's 'Parkland,' which, at over 500 pages, is merely an excerpt of his all-encompassing telling of the assassination of JFK, a larger work called 'Reclaiming History,' which, I understand, may be around 1,600 pages. 

Parkland is an hour-by-hour chronological recount of the events of the assassination, packed with over 1500 footnotes, largely corroborated by witness testimony. 

It is fascinating. The humanity of it. I would recommend it highly as a choice for summer reading, particularly for students or young people who want to know more about how the world works, or how things are. Or were. 

The assassination of JFK changed the world in the blink of an eye, and the fact that the world saw it unfold through network television in a matter of days was a benchmark event in history. 

Bugliosi's treatment of Jackie is as a stoic heroine. She apparently insisted on hosting visiting world dignitaries back at the White House after what had to be one of the most difficult days of her life - saying goodbye to her husband, the fallen President of the United States. As if the preceding few days weren't enough. Unbelievable. 

If Portman's performance is able to capture the power of the events of those days, she may very well win an Oscar.",2017-06-25T19:44:01.000Z,1
2016-11-14T17:54:09.000Z,g9pW3B8Ycc4,JACKIE | OFFICIAL TRAILER | FOX Searchlight,"I actually finished this movie, and I go through about a dozen that fail the 5 minute rule, meaning I should be pulled right into the movie in 5 minutes or less. Most of the time, if the trailer stinks or the movie fails the rule, it doesn't get miraculously better. 

I liked Portman, and the guy who played the brother. I'm not that attached to either actor or the original story in themselves. 

The shooting scene is about 3/4ths through the movie. of course, I saw it, as did everyone else. It's very grainy and blurry. Hard to see what's going on. There exists an exceptionally cleaned up copy that's very unnerving. Again, not married to the time frame or the people involved. I don't get creeped out easily. I was kind of woogie at both the cleaned up real version and this fictious one shown here. Both are pretty haunting pieces of film. 

Out of 10, I'd go about a 6.5 on this one. I liked her, felt sorry for her. She truly suffered a lot. I wouldn't use the word ""brave"" as that tends to feel like an insult if you get thrown into a situation. Brave is guarding someone's body with your own, or saving people in a burning building. People in this situation had no other choices.",2017-06-24T02:51:33.000Z,1

I don't think she still fully channels Jackie though, she's done a great job with the voice however. Oscar worthy, but I feel that this part is still missing ""something"". I still see and hear Natalie Portman playing Jackie Kennedy, albeit very well, but none the less I see Natalie Portman and not Jackie Kennedy. I think perhaps Natalie is too iconic, very distinct voice and very distinct in general, hard to remove those characteristics from any character she plays.

When I heard they were making a movie about Jackie K., I feared another conventional, hagiographic, tailor made for oscars biopic, like Kidman's Grace of Monaco or Naomi Watts' Diana, two huge failures, directing and writing-wise. I was wrong. It had been a long time since I hadn't seen a movie almost as good as its trailer. Jackie isn't perfect, its first half has pace issues, the great Sarsgaard is a serious miscast, a few other things, but DAMN... beyond Portman's grand performance, beyond all the clever and poignant things it tells about grief, legacy, the writing of history, the Camelot myth, even a glance at what was, in the end, nothing short of a coup d'√âtat... it's first and foremost a cinematic marvel.

We know about the assassination and a little about the guy himself but his wife isn't really talked about. At all. Only reason I know her name is because of an episode on Red Dwarf. For me, this is one of those instances where you know someone probably has a really good story to tell, but for some reason you never think to read about it and freaking adore when they make movies out of people like that.",2017-01-18T20:59:38.000Z,0

2016-11-14T17:54:09.000Z,g9pW3B8Ycc4,JACKIE | OFFICIAL TRAILER | FOX Searchlight,"I've seen ""Jackie"" and it was impressive. The film focuses about the wife of John F. Kennedy who lost her husband during the assassination in 1963. She seeks her point of view that she lost her husband, and she can't find a way to be happy just to be very emotional character whether she can be calm or do something to be okay. Natalie Portman done a great job for portraying as the true story of Jackie Kennedy. She captured her performance to be a depressing First Lady who seeks that her husband died and she made her acting very well done. The acting is very well done, the sequence done so well to be taken in the early 60's, and the movie is beyond dark and very gripping that it makes it shock of how did it happened. It's more of study biopic that can tell a story that should be more important. The director, Pablo Larra√≠n did a impressive job for making his feature tribute of Jackie Kennedy, and I'm hoping that he will get an Oscar Nod and so does Natalie Portman who did a fantastic job. Overall, a very depressing biopic movie.

""More than merely offering a backstage pass to history, Larra√≠n draws us into the utter uniqueness of a situation where personal loss and national duty collided so violently. No reasonable person could be expected to absorb a tragedy of that magnitude, but Jackie makes shrewd political decisions and stands firmly behind them when others plea for caution. Shock and lucidity would seem to be contradictory responses, but Jackie makes that duality seem possible and astonishingly heroic. Her abiding sense of patriotism could not be suppressed by an assassin's bullet."" - Scott Tobias",2016-12-02T14:57:42.000Z,0
