2017-06-15T09:00:03.000Z,IsAlKzokl-8,Goodbye Christopher Robin | Official HD Trailer | 2017,"A.A Milne and his wife wanted a girl, so when Christopher Robin Milne was born, they dressed him up as a girl. They grew his hair long. They plaited it. A.A Milne's wife, was the one who usually played/watched him when Christopher's nanny wasn't around. She told A.A about Christopher's thoughts and what he did. A.A Milne decided to write a book about it. About his childhood. As Christopher grew, he ended up going to a boarding school. At the boarding school, all the other boys word make fun of him because of his feminism and most likely, his fame. He ended up hating Pooh, and his friends, and also his father, as A.A Milne basically revealed part of Christopher's life. He neither talked much to either of his parents. A.A Milne regretted his decision. Christopher was embarrassed and felt as if his childhood was ruined. In his adult years, he married his cousin, and they had 'incest'. They had a child, called Claire, who was deformed(I think). A.A Milne died in 1956 and his wife died 15 years after. Christopher died in 1996, Claire died in 2012.

In the story, I think each teddy and person had a disorder. Like, each one represents a disorder or something. Christopher Robin Milne name his stuffed bear doll, after a bear called Winnie, he always saw at a zoo. Pooh came from a swan he saw on holiday, and named Pooh. Put them both together, and you have got 'Winnie The Pooh'! 

Sorry if this information is wrong or historically inacc urate, as I didn't have A.A Milne or Christopher Robin Milne to ask.

Sorry for the rant.

2017-06-15T09:00:03.000Z,IsAlKzokl-8,Goodbye Christopher Robin | Official HD Trailer | 2017,"I just finished watching this film yesterday. My thoughts will contain SPOILERS.





It's very good, and very charming, good acting, wonderful cinematography, I even got nostalbut it has its flaws. It is inaccurate to what actually happened; while Christopher was very close to his nanny, he was more closer to his mother than his father, Milne didn't really have all that PTSD, Daphne wasn't all fame obsessed and was the one who came up with 
most of the material (I couldn't stand this film's portrayal of her at all but it wasn't Robbie's fault, it was the script she had to work with), playing with the stuffed animals with Christopher (though his relationship with her wasn't perfect, he only saw her once after his father died), and Christopher even said he wasn't angry with his parents, had ""said 'good bye' to them a long time ago"", he more had a love-hate relationship to the success of the Pooh books (and even at first enjoyed fame as a boy but grew to hate it when he was bullied at school), and he even actually did accept the money from the success, but according to him, only to help his severely disabled daughter (I'm also planning to read the books he wrote himself). I also felt the tone between the serious dark stuff and the lighthearted stuff could have been balanced a little bit better, and it could make one feel (not that it happened to me or anyone I know of) guilty of having read the Pooh books, I'm afraid, some people may end up like that...I could be wrong on that though.

Not saying it's bad but its issues did hold it back a bit.",2018-02-28T02:17:43.000Z,0

And here's another; I would think it rather unfortunate actually that a man who gained his fame based on something his father wrote would grow such resentment to not only his father but the very spark that spawned a series of entertainment for an entire generation of children who mark their childhood by his works. I am not obtuse. I understand why he may have felt this way, albeit inexplicably selfish - but all I get from the content of his father's works was a love letter written to his only son the only way he knew how.

English born, emigrated to Canada as a teen, studied in Toronto, Ontario. Got a job in Winnipeg, Alberta. War breaks out and he is on a train journey in preparation to be sent to war after enlisting. Purchases a bear cub in Whiter River, Ontario, and names her Winnipeg after his new hometown (The mother of the cub was killed by a hunter). Bear is nicknamed ""Winnie"". He takes her across the Atlantic with him to Salisbury Plain where she becomes a military mascot for a cavalry regiment. During his years at war and involvement in France, she is placed in the care of London Zoo where she becomes incredibly popular. She has character and a sweet disposition. Milne and Christopher see Winnie and are completely enamored with her, Chris even renaming his own teddy bear after Winnie, thus Winnie-the-Pooh. Colebourn had intentions of bringing her back to Canada with him after the war but she was content, well cared for and well loved by the people of London, so he donated her to the zoo. He continued to receive updates on her well being. This bear was the true foundation inspiration for the books. People can biatch to me in response all they want, but to ignore and squish away that side of history would be really crude! And film turn off.",2017-10-14T00:34:59.000Z,0

As cydashlee down below correctly points out, the inspiration for ""Winnie"" the Pooh comes quite obviously from a real black bear in a Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada zoo that was a favourite of the author's son. It was not just the kid's damned teddy bear. This story is so well known that it's one one of CBC's ""Heritage Moments"", in at least one children's storybook, and is one of many cool trivia items engraved in the minds of many Canadians of a certain age walking around today. If this movie takes place entirely in England and in the war flashbacks of the author without any visits ""across the pond"" to Canada where the author can see the actual inspiration for his flagship character, then the film is bull - no, wait - bearshit.",2017-08-05T16:38:07.000Z,0

While there's no denying that the books are iconic, the real-life Christopher Robin wasn't that fond of them. Not that he hated Pooh, he was just really bothered by being thrown into fame like that, which in turn caused his relationship with his family to become a bit strained. He also didn't like Disney for what they did with the character, as he didn't think Winnie the Pooh should be commercial.",2017-06-18T21:53:39.000Z,0

Yes, there was a real bear named Winnie the Pooh. Christopher Robin Milne also gave the toys which were the basis for the books' character to the New York Public Library. His parents were aristocratic types who would spend about an hour a day with him while allowing him to be raised by a nanny and servants. He was alienated from his parents and his mother refused to see him on her deathbed. He hated the portrayal of himself from the books. Sounds like a tragicomedy/horror story to me. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/i-knew-christopher-robin--the-real-christopher-robin/",2017-06-18T20:10:42.000Z,0
