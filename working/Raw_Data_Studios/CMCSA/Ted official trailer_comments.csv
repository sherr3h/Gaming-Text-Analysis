Fourthly: Seth MacFarlene doesn't have any political ties to the Zionist movement what-so-ever. Nor is he Jewish.

Fifthly: Don't just assume that all movies produced in a country are propaganda for a particular point of view; actually watch the movie or research it before making accusations. Movies with political points in countries with large film industries tend to be fairly varied. Some movies, such as Ted, don't have any political point at all: Purely for entertainment value.",2013-01-22T14:41:30.000Z,0

I laughed pretty much at every scene, as opposed to Paul, also about a foul yet cute CGI oddity which stole the screen from the live action stars. That was good, but not as stupid or broad in its comedy as Ted is, which to find funny, you have to be a fan of Family GuyAmerican Dad.",2013-01-01T05:01:51.000Z,0

But Seth Macfarlane made such an awesome movie.

A struggle between keeping your childhood and transitioning to being an adult.
Remember this is an R rated movie, it's meant for adults. (obviously)
Seth reminds us about their transition from being a child to being a grown man.
This movie shows us how a grown man does not have to let go of their childhood imagination, heroes, and activities.
Other thoughts: Ted signifies childhood corruption
