2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I just saw the movie, 3 years after it came out. Due to the critics I saw, I refused to watch it when it came out. Let me say Warcraft is an AMAZING movie in every aspect. It annoys me how the critics have treated it, and its director. Finally there's a movie that has it all: faithful to the original story, a solid argument with interesting and wholesome characters, secondary stories that contribute to the film and don't feel empty, decent effects, and finally, a perfect ending (that leaves you wanting more).

I'm usually extremely harsh with movies, especially the recent cringy ones that seems are made for kids with stupid jokes all the time, empty characters, romances that don't make sense, etc. But this is not one of those. Maybe that's the reason the critics treated Warcraft the way they did. It didn't sell as well as the ""family friendly"" ones. The new ""conventional"". It makes me so upset that their incompetence is keeping me from watching the second, and third delivery of this story, when nowadays the cinema is nothing but remakes and shitty movies. 

Hopefully we'll have Warcraft II some time in the future, I will pay my ticket to see it at the premiere, as it deserves. If you are reading this and haven't seen it yet, please DO. Especially if your a Warcraft fan.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I went into this film without expectation whatsoever.  I'm of the minority of viewers without any real Warcraft experience -- having never played any previous Warcraft title and only ever playing a very miniscule amount of World of Warcraft -- so naturally I watched this film adaptation as if it were just a standalone piece of media.

Afterwards I had heard that critics tore this film apart with negative reviews, the general consensus being that Warcraft underperformed and failed to meet expectations.  This sentiment is one that I find myself unable to relate to.

Personally I found the film to be entertaining at the bare minimum.  If I had to air a complaint, I would say that the dialogue frequently left something to be desired.  That the writers made it harder to remember character names and roles than I'd have wished.  That the factions seemed to act without a foundation of tangible reason.  Orcs, in my mind, shouldn't have been willing participants in their enslavement to demons, and humans shouldn't have been so helpless against the orc invasion.  I felt as though some characters were competent and, as a result, weren't ever in any real danger while the other characters were completely impotent and seemed like defenseless children rather than soldiers.

But the main cast was lovely.  I found myself rooting for each protagonist, regardless of their allegiances, no matter how one-dimensional they seemed to be.  The world was beautiful, the sets were interesting, and the action sequences were impactful.  It might not be a front-runner for Oscar praise, and it might not be a film I could ever compare to classics, but Warcraft served its purpose in my opinion.  It was entertaining enough that I find myself looking at clips online, and I might watch it again.  To call it bad feels a bit harsh in my opinion, but my opinion is just that -- my opinion.

Here's to hoping the next installment is as good if not better.  Also, if they focus on a story surrounding just a few specific characters, Starcraft could also make for a great film adaptation.  Perhaps even better than Warcraft adaptations.",2018-12-08T03:03:07.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I hate critics. It's very obvious that odds were not in this movie's favor. Everything that could go wrong, did. The movie switched studios like at least twice during it's development - there were disagreements. For the most part, the story is true to the original one, probably more so than any other movie based on a game/book, but was shortened way too much because, I guess, the developers didn't think people would want the movie to be too long. So they ended up cutting out too much, and the movie ended up being something that fans of WoW /Warcraft could easily follow due to prior knowledge, but people who do not know anything about the lore struggled to make sense of the movie.
Think of some of the great books with rich lore made into movies: Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. First Harry Potter was a 2.5 hour long movie, first Lord of the rings was 3.5ish hour movie as well. This movie? Less than 2 hours. Of course people couldn't follow it, you cut out the damn story!
I'm so mad. I loved this movie, but I have a bias as I am a huge fan, but because they messed it up, there likely won't be a sequel.

Critics are the worst people. We do not need movie critics - just listen to the fan reviews. This is true of ANY movie. Do NOT rely on critic reviews.",2018-07-06T21:49:09.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Im not a legit ""critic"" but I am an avid player of the game since vanilla and Ive played all the warcraft games. My childhood being locked in my room with my computer. Proud to be gamer! haha.  Its not as bad as what other people say but I feel like Im in two worlds that got me confused.  Its like watching LOTR and Anduin Lothar is played by Ryan Reynolds. The comedic side of it didnt really fit in to the movie.  As an epic game and pretty much the creme de la creme of its genre I was hoping they would go for the serious route.  Especially if it involves Draka taking a bite off of another orc, humans head being squished and all of its glorious goriness.  Next would be Ben Schnetzer playing Khadgar.  I felt that he didnt have a strong presence in the movie. Probably because they made his character nerdy and as if almost helpless but hey he saved the Azeroth!  He reminds me of Podrick Payne, the squire from Game of Thrones.  Lastly and I promise this is the last ""con"" review, its the unecessary CGIs like the glowing eyes of the night elves, pretty much over the top yet irrelevant. I must say theres a lot of glowy glowy eyes in this movie. Other than that, Gul'dan is really epic and Medivh is played very well by Archangel aka Ben Foster, 2 Bens!.  Especially the part when he is halfway looking like Sargeras.  That gave me the chills!  So all in all I give it 3 stars. Was it a good movie?  Absolutely!  Would I watch it again? Probably not.",2016-08-04T12:35:41.000Z,3

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Agreed! Here is something to consider in all this. Warcraft collectively now is the highest grossing game to movie film ever. It will likely cross 450 million soon. Which neither Independence Day 2 which was clearly a bomb. Nor X-Men apocalypse have done yet. Sad considering the install base of these films. 

Now while it can be argued it is done very poorly domestically. That is really not that important anymore. Outside of Marvel, Disney & Pixar there isn't much domestically worth talking about. Which has broken over 250 million domestically. The fact Warcraft is pushing 500 million. Even with International sales is impressive. 

Considering the box office bombs of the last couple of months. So the chances of a sequel are possible. Altough maybe not on as wide a release. Warcraft market seems better positioned outside US then in. So we may get a sequel but have to wait a bit longer. But really no complaints as it was quit good. Considering how bad it could have been I can't complain really. :)",2016-07-11T01:50:52.000Z,1

United States is pretty soon going to be second in film box office and they only have themselves to think.All you have to do is stop griping you have good movies already but u r too opinionated to see them. Stop or pretty soon we are just going to have nothing. I mean you get angry when a sequel and reboot is out. You want more originality but get butthurt when an original does come out cause u dont like it. Boo hoo fuck u. Suck it up and shut up.So glad this was is now the highest grossing video game movie.,2017-01-29T18:17:50.000Z,1

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"It's much, much better than I expected.  That said, it's a movie for people who are at least somewhat familiar with WarCraft lore.  I myself started playing from WC3 but it wasn't hard for me to recognize all the locations from my WoW years (Started playing during the last months of vanilla, and I stopped after WoTLK).  There's some small discrepancies in the story, and some locations, like Dalaran floating in the air already, but those didn't bother me.  Overall the movie is great.  The only ones I've heard complain about it is people who don't know absolutely anything about the franchise, and expected a much more simplified plot.  Like, for example, to them Khadgar is just some fumbling unimportant side character.  When they see StormWind they go ""That's some castle I don't care about LOL"", or they giggle like idiots at the glowing eyes and say ""pff, whats with the glowing eyes? that shit's wack yo!"".  I can't be too harsh though, they don't know the lore, so they can't possibly appreciate moments like when King Llane stopped to talk to kid Varian, because they don't know, don't care who he might be some day, or to care about ""who that green kid floating down the river is, or why the movie is wasting so much time on him"".  I also can't expect them to appreciate that nostalgic trip to Karazhan, because they never raided that place on weekends with old friends.  To them it's wasted time instead of getting to the ""cool combat scenes for which they paid a movie ticket to go see!"".  You get where I'm going with this..",2016-06-15T12:08:58.000Z,1

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Let's all give the critics a round of applause for unfairly lambasting a franchise to death so they can make a name for themselves. I kept hearing the same ""plot is too convoluted and ridiculous"" argument, so I went into the theater expecting something truly messy and incoherent. While some aspects require a bit of thinking to follow (oh no!!!), I can confidently say the amount of criticism was completely unwarranted.  There have been far, far more convoluted movies that still acquired critical approval, so to see Warcraft get panned for being concise is a fucking joke. The whole plot is pretty clear if you're paying attention. You have to infer a few  things, and the names will require a little effort to remember, but overall it's really not asking that much of viewers so long as you're willing to accept that some minor details will require more installments to fully reconcile (a concept that apparently is only egregious when done by a game based movie). The pacing is reasonably fast, which is perfect for properly fleshing out such a rich world, and is not hard to follow if you aren't expecting the movie to spoon feed every plot point.  I also admire Jones' boldness in embracing the darker aspects of the Warcraft universe. There are several scenes that are genuinely moving and emotionally/visually powerful, scenes that most directors these days are too timid to execute properly. Warcraft has some flaws,  such as a few lackluster line deliveries and some abrupt location transitions near the beginning to name a few, but nothing that comes remotely close to sabotaging the entire spectacle. I also would have liked to see a bit more gore, but I can understand the need to avoid the R rating with such a heavy investment (the violence is still very satisfying, however). If you're an action/fantasy lover and you're deciding whether or not to go see it, please do. The story is engaging and the visuals and action offer more than enough to fully back it up.  If you are somehow disappointed, at least ensure you made a conscious effort to actually absorb the information on screen before you criticize my recommendation.",2016-06-15T03:12:51.000Z,87

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I just watched it and this is my personal rating,
The movie is a fucking 5/5!!

disclaimer: I'm a bit biased because I'm a fan of the Warcraft games in general especially the RTS.
Warcraft 1 was one of my first RTS that I played along with C&C and that's way back in 1995.
Anyway I'll just list the it's pros and cons of the movie.

Pros:
+ They nailed the look of the movie, especially the ORCs. It just looks and feels like Warcraft. The armors, weapons, props looked really good as well.
+ CGI is amazing, definitely one of the best by ILM. The facial expressions of the Orcs are just awesome to look at, it might rival Avatar in that department.
+  The game locations, stormwind, dalaran. Seeing it in the big screen is a joy to us Warcraft fans.
(Although some locations are not accurate like Dalaran is not supposed to float not until Archimonde sieged it during the events of WC3)
+ Dialogue is good enough, dont expect some LotR narrative.
+ Lothar is just awesome, hopefully we will see more of Travis Fimmel in the big screen.Overall most of the actors did well even the CGI orcs Durotan, Ogrim,  Guldan etc.
+ It's action packed no dull moments for me.
+ Magics are represented well in this movie, theres incantations and 
magic circle.  If you are a mage in World of Warcraft you prolly had 
orgasmed after seeing it lol.
+ There are some shots later on when the cameras are overhead and it looked like a warcraft RTS game.
+ This movie gave me feels than that specific BvS scene. 

Cons
- Some plotpoints might be confusing because the movie is just only 2HRs, the movie pacing is quite fast.
- Not adding some familiar game music is a missed opportunity. 
- Dwarves are CGI
- Battles are quite short I expected more. Also needs better battle choreography, the footmen lacks battle formations. The human armies lacks variety in soldiers or classes. No archers, no clerics etc. lol

I think the movie will hold itself well to those who are not familiar with the source material.
I just hope that the movie will just fine in the box office, it needs its returns for future sequel/s. The Warcraft lore is just vast and it will be a shame if this first movie will be the last.
Just go ahead have an open mind and watch it, Ignore the critics. Your opinion is what matter most.
The movie entertained me than most recent superhero movie releases.
Hopefully the Assassins creed movie will do great, we need more good videogame movies.",2016-05-25T12:38:12.000Z,4

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"The very first shoot of the trailer is Dun Morogh. 0:16 the  tower is Karazhan, cuz the it is build on the spot of the fracture of the Azeroth, the shinning thing is the fracture of time. And the man with white hair is Morres, the butler of Medivh, cuz at this point of time, Medivh might not be that old, which I believe that this is happened few years after Medivh woke up from coma. And the storm wind city 0:19 is the most original city that was very different from the one in the WOW, (that white building is Cathedral of Light). I think is because the limitation of game server and low wage paid to VanCleef and his crew, so that the one in the game can not rebuilt after Orcs destroyed it.

I know they have made them look like how they look in the game but honestly deviating from the source material ever so slightly would have been acceptable IMO just to make them feel more real.

56 000 supportes of a pro vanilla petition, countless newspaperarticles (even in major and renowned german newspapers) and FB and Twitter posts and still NO reaction from Blizzard! That's so weak of them. 

It has become all about publicity, money and hyping every pointless new feature they release for one of their games. Quantity has gotten the better of quality.

I played and payed WC3, WC3 TfT, D2, D3, HS and WoW since the very beginning but now I am done with Blizzard. When they have proven that they deliver quality rather then lazy features to make more money I will be back.

Don't get me wrong i love(d) Blizzard but right now they aren't themselves.

WoW was and is for some people still that addictive an experience... World of Warcraft USED TO BE such a great game that over 11 million of us at one point were subscribing. Now WoW has rumoured to have only 3 to 4 million, and mostly Chinese players from that. WoW was SO GREAT a game (Vanilla era, The Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm were WoW's high-points, and starting with Mists of Pandaria, while the game did get prettier, it lost a lot of what it once was. Warlords of Draenor sucked unless you liked your Henchmann's Garrison as your personal castle, Ashran sucked! WoW PvP has been a lackluster joke since the end of Cataclysm, I spent most of the Pandaria and Draenor eras trolling, mocking, and 'role playing' my rogue characters, and it eventually got me banned. Oh well, I was spending too much time in Azzeroth anyhow! LoLoLoLoL I found other games to replace it while I still phathom my WoW Exile. FOR THE HORDE, losers! :P",2016-04-03T19:48:08.000Z,0

I just wanna say the only races that would be in the movie at the time in lore the movie takes place (off the top of my head) would be orcs, humans, HIGH elves, and dwarves (and I assume gnomes). Night elves and tauren are on a different continent (Kalimdor), so asking for them to be in this movie is like asking Native Americans to be in 300, lol just saying xD
Also, the Draenei, with the exception of Garona who's HALF draenei, wouldn't be here mainly since they're in hiding on Draenor (If I remember correctly)
Undead and Pandaren don't show up at all until Warcaft III (The undead cause of Arthas' story starting back in Warcraft III, and as far as I know, the only Pandaren in it was Chen Stormstout in Warcraft III's expansion, the Frozen Throne.)
Blood Elves are just High Elves that renamed themselves in honor of the Sunwell's explosion (If I'm wrong about that someone please correct me lol)
The Trolls, Goblins, Worgen and other races I'm unsure about, but I just wanted people to be aware of the races in WoW versus races in Warcraft I: Orcs and humans situation :)",2016-03-28T22:13:30.000Z,0

When Bubble hearth was around. If you know what that means that you know how far back I go. In Order for them to make each Story even Wrath of the Lich King. They need this one to blow every other movie out of the water. Even Lord of the rings. So if you all want to see each story get made, and put on the big screen you're all going to have to see this movie 100 times over. Spend a lot of money, and spread the word out. That is if you want them to make each game into a movie. Let's go to the list.

1. Warcraft
2. Warcraft 2
3. Warcraft 3
4.World of warcraft
5.World of Warcraft Burning Crusade
6.World of Warcraft Wrath Of The Lich King
7. World of Warcraft Cataclysm
8. World of Warcraft Mist of Pandaria
9. World of Warcraft Warlords of Draenor

I want to see them all on the big screen. So everyone try your best to show your support, and get those tickets. Show them that you want them all

Not getting hyped about something that mixes elements of any expendable legendary movie with a little bit of Game of thrones. Especially when Universal has its hand in this.
I don't know...   I don't get the same feeling from it when I played Men vs Orcs. and W3. Even WoW isn't reflected.
That's not Warcraft. That's Mainmediacraft which is why this trailer feels all the same to me in the end. Like one of those 3D animation hyped up movies that I cannot even remember the title of.


I rather had a pure 1:30 hours original Warcraft cinematic, with no cheap actor voices. Orcs here sound like they have fingers in their mouth. 
But you had to be stingy Blizzard... Lets cross our fingers they didn't screw it up. Why didnt they dub the cheap actors voices with unique voices like Chris Metzen, Carlos Larkin, Jamieson Price, Patrick Seitz and P.J. Mattson. The ones that actually deserve to be in a movie. 
Btw, couldnt they give it different name? Every game has a second title. Why not the movie!? And I dare you using the same generic trailer score in the actual movie.",2016-01-30T11:32:37.000Z,0

... but here comes the bad... the humans just look and sound awful. And i dont mean what they look like. The human actors have cringeworthy dialogue and acting performance. I have a strong feeling the human actors will bring this movie down.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),When you play a game where at least 75% of the characters are female then a movie trailer comes out looking like this it's clear Hollywood has done no script research¬†whatsoever and flopped the movie before it began. I wanted elves and wizards casting magic not male grunt trolls that look like Shrek. It could have been brilliant but the only people who will enjoy this movie are the ones that have never played the game. I played as a female necromancer but I'm sure they won't exist in the movie because they use magic rather than weapons.

But as I know the city of Dalaran was somewhere in Hillsbrad Foothils  at the shore of Lordamere Lake, east of Silverpine Forest and west of Alterac at the time when this piece of lore takes place. As I know Dalaran was floated to Northrend many years later when the cursade started against Icecrown. This movie takes place even before the Scourge broke the magical barrier defending the city and killing Archmage Antonidas, and at that time Dalaran was admittedly on the ground.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I'd like to point something out. A LOT of people are wary of this movie specifically because movie adaptations of video games tend to be terrible. Keep in mind, this is NOT based directly on Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. Were that the case, we'd see lots of town building and small fighting over the towns. This is moreso based on the lore BOOKS involved with the Warcraft franchise. Book-to-movie adaptations tend to be executed a lot better, especially by the likes of Legendary Pictures. I have strong faith that the movie will at least be good, if not great.¬†Just from what was shown in the teaser and trailer, I know Rise of the Horde and The Last Guardian should be involved, probably up to the very beginning of Tides of Darkness. I see the movie ending either with the fleet arriving at Southshore or the events (I won't spoil) that lead up to it. Pretty much the span of the First War.",2016-01-15T01:53:42.000Z,3

Legendary. WTF, man?

Why are you not advertising the SHIT out of the 3D for this movie? EVERYTHING was in 3D and it looked a thousand times better than how it looks in 2D. There was probably more 3D in this trailer than there was in the movie I went to watch, and yours looked fantastic! All the backgrounds and CGI that I thought looked questionable here looked awesome in 3D. I normally actively avoid 3D if I can help it, but for this movie, I'm making sure I see it that way. Seriously. Advertise that shit.

Not that it isn't a good message, but I just don't want to see the film used as a vehicle for that. I'm just afraid the writers are going ''we have to show casual viewers that Warcraft isn't just about killing'' and take it way overboard with the antiracism message. It's Warcraft, dangit.

(If the movie turns out great) It's from the first Warcraft game so you don't have to know since it's from the beginning. What I dislike is the fact some people may think this is about WoW and Not the game series before WoW.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),Possible spoiler alert: This is just my opinion from this trailer. It looks like there are two factions of Orcs. We got the original Orcs who are tanned skinned and we got the green skin Orcs who have been corrupted by demon blood. Perhaps in their original home world of Draenor the two factions are at war and their planet is being destroyed possibly because of magic and demonic energy. The portal to Azeroth has been created and both sides are going through it. The green skins want to conquer Azeroth while the Orcs want to create a new home for their people and escape the legion army of green skins.¬†I think the Orcs will ally with the Humans to fight the green skins who threaten them both.,2015-12-10T01:02:18.000Z,0

And for the most part they look really really good. Sometimes, it's not about looking real, it's about helping elevate the quality of the story and the characters. 
I remember people saying that the Hulk in The incredible Hulk (2008) looked like a video game character, but to me he looks very photorealistic at times, and just the attention to detail made him more organic. THE MORE ORGANIC THE CHARACTERS LOOK (NOT REAL! THAT'S A DIFFERENT TOPIC), THE MORE YOU BELIEVE IN THEM. This is the same in Warcraft. 
It's very sad that people complain about visual effects when they're no easy task at all. They are a long process.

A few among you, those who represent the fans of this game, have been wonderful subjects in my own personal experiment on fanbases. I've always had trouble with fanbases, be it from Harry Potter to classical music all the way to Marvel. And I know nothing about Warcraft, and I don't give two shits about whether this movie is good or bad. I wanted to start up a rise, and see to what lengths a dumb little fanbase will go to protect their dumb little hobbies in their own minds. Turns out, if even the slightest criticism arises, it will be buried under brilliant counterpoints such as ""Yes you are spoiled"" (Because you say so, right?) and undeniably genius logical quandaries such as ""It's not cliched if it follows the same plot as the game, right?"" (Very wrong. Any competent writer will tell you the same.)  You're all participating in the same type of mob mentality that rules religious cults, and will go to any lengths to make sure that your perception of reality remains intact.

Then any studio would likely want to commit.  Personally i would have prefered Starcraft.  As would have been easier to adapt to film but i digress.  

Personally Pixar would have seemed to have been a better fit. But maybe this would have been a bit to dark for them to take the risk. Well i guess we will have to see what happens. :/",2015-11-20T07:28:11.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Warcraft fans are made up of two groups of people. 

Those who will always complain about everything, regardless of whether they play, will stop playing or don't play anymore. 

And those who regardless of which style, lore or approach is used to continue exploring the universe is used, enjoy it for what it is. One of the best fantasy mediums ever created. 

The fact that the fans are often divided due to passionate opinions is evidence enough for the greatness of Warcraft. 

I'm just happy to finally see the movie happening. Looks like they will stick to stories and game characters. I honestly don't see anything going wrong with this one, unless Hollywood pull a dirty trick.",2015-11-18T22:47:09.000Z,0

There are a lot of critics of the CGI and the budget of the film and my inner film student agrees that this isn't ""Avatar"" level CGI but as a long time consumer of the Warcraft Universe people need to realize that Blizzard has a style. For YEARS people have criticized WoW for not having the realism graphics that a lot of the newer MMOs offered and that it was just ""too cartoony"". Blizzard openly came out and stated that ""We have a style unique to our world. This is how we want it. This is how it will be."" This movie, despite my inner disappointment  that Blizz didn't just extend their Cinematic team and work with another company just for the movies, has captured that blizzard style we Warcraft consumers know. Those are the orcs we know and love from the Warcraft Universe.

Now everybody will know why WoW is so popular. I'm a Destiny player now and do not play WoW anymore, but that game has a very soft spot in my heart. Those who play the game will understand what I mean. I had so many good memories, so many friends that I still see and a wonderful community to experience a brave new world. WoW was meant to be a cyber world, but it went way beyond that. I just hope that this movie will help people to understand why this lore and story is incredible. Man, I got very emotional, but this is just the way WoW makes me feel. Hope this movie will reflect the Warcraft franchise perfect enough to carry it to larger community.

They are trying to tell the fans this is how the story started and not some big overly hyped trailer to excite everyone. The music sounds like it wants to lead you on more into the tale and that's why you get rise and fall sounds in all of the scenes.

Remember folks, this is the first story of Warcraft. They are taking it slow and not rushing the lore. They want to introduce the Orcs and Humans to everyone especially those who never played the game. Base building is where it's at to set the foundation for future Warcraft movies. 2 hours of movie isn't anywhere close to introduce all the characters from the entire game series let alone tell the lore. I understand some dumb people will be disappointed when they won't see their favorite character and will cry about it. I'm telling you Blizzard is playing it safe here folks.

I've tried to see how the CGI could be shitty for the sake of understanding where others are coming from, and there is just no sound reasoning to back that up (at least I haven't heard any yet). The detail on the orcs is stunning, you can see amazing detail in their skin, eyes, expressions, etc... I can see how using real humans with CGI orcs can be strange, and I would also love a full CGI warcraft movie. But for what this is, it looks great. The CGI isn't shitty, if you don't like it then I think your problem is the intended style for Warcraft orcs- not the CGI. As for the backgrounds, of course there are going to be green screens- this isn't Azeroth it's planet Earth.  I personally look forward to the movie, but am cautious.",2015-11-13T03:35:02.000Z,2

This has only worked(in very limited fashions) a couple times before. And I already see issues with this choice in this trailer. I can only imagine how much worse it is going to be for a 2 hour long film. And what about the gnomes and dwarves? They gonne be cg or real??? They really should have kept everything cgi, and used the exaggerated humies they used in their previous work. Would have been much better.

Opening the trailer with Elywnn Forest, putting some A Call to Arms (01:10 onwards), the Stormwind music (Part 2 at 03:30 with the buildup). Hell even having the Legends of Azeroth (login music) playing.

0:56 Before covered, High Elves on the left corner :D
1:00 Ner'zhul
1:05 Orgrim, i don't know if its CGI or a costume, looks frikkin' REAL.
1:16 What happened to Durotan's eyes? This shot needs more rendering.
1:19 Great shot, wanna try that Gryphon too
1:35 wops, needs better blending
1:41 Blackhand, very great rendering here, contented.
1:43 baby Thrall again doesn't look good enough, distracting.
1:45 Thrall's mother, well done CGI, we can feel here emotions.
1:47 ""We have no choice, we should attack with full force"" I don't like the line or not delivered properly, or maybe the sound quality, something's not right, feels cheap.
1:54 Bloodlust
1:55 The infamous jumping while casting the mount (without boots).

Judging by the Orcs' motivation of a 'dying world,' this is entirely based on the story of WC1. There, the Orcs were not under the influence of demonic corruption. In fact, they had been led by Gul'dan and the Warlocks for quite some time and had only stumbled upon Azeroth by accident. So, if this movie uses that story as the dialogue indicates, there is no Burning Legion. The whole concept of a demonic army wasn't written in until WC2, when the storyline of the Orcs was entirely retconned.

So no Burning Legion = No Scourge = No Ner'zhul = No Lich King. Sorry, friends.",2015-11-11T01:47:36.000Z,0

First thing is armour and clothes. I just wish it would look more practical and gritty. Now, ofcourse, I'm not arguing for hardcore realism in a fantasy movie, just for it to look less like a costume.

Second thing is the actor for Anduin Lothar. Don't get me wrong, I love Travis Fimmel. I think he's fucking great as Ragnar. But I just always pictured Lothar as some kind of a Theoden/Fordring/Tyrael mix. You know, glorious voice, trimmed beard, ""For king and country!"", all that.

Is the thought that not enough paying customers would go to a movie that *does* look like the game trailers but with a feature-length running time?  Or perhaps that the extra CGI work would cost more than they consider worthwhile?  If they wanted to save at least a little 3D design cost, they could maybe have tried the Dinosaur route and added their work on top of live-action location shots...  I dunno, I just think the mix of game-trailer orcs and live-action humans looks kinda odd.  Maybe it's just me.  *shrugs*",2015-11-10T00:52:20.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"This movie will fail as all¬†movies¬†based on games¬†failed before. I didn't expect much, but at least a little effort in costume and make up design. Why bother with real actors, when you can go 100% full CGI? This looks no better than a blizzard game Intro (which are great) and as a live action movie, we can expect more... (Even people at the cosplay contest gave more effort and love to their costumes...)
Also the trailer¬†feels somehow rushed.¬† They've put every famous characters in the movie which I suspect doesn't give much space for character development.¬†May be, it would have been better if they have done 2 separate movies, showing the horde and the alliance side... and the 2nd movie the real conflict... just a thought.Anyway, I believe this movie will be ok (for younger generations even fantastic). But for movie veterans (Warcraft fan or not) it will be just another popcorn movie. (I pray that I am wrong)",2015-11-09T19:51:08.000Z,3

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Spent a few years playing Warcraft and WoW myself back in the day. Looks pretty good, overall. I think the director and production company did the best they could while staying within the boudaries of the game's lore. 

The issue I have is with the game itself. While most fantasy settings have a tendency to be racially biased (i.e. the ""good"" races - humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, etc. always being white), Blizzard took things a step further when they created Warcraft. They followed the familiar LOTR formula with the Alliance and it's races, but the designs for the races of the Horde were just racist and lazy. They basically just copy/pasted the real-life cultures of various people of color onto all the beast-races of the horde. Orcs=African, trolls=Hatian/Jamaican, tauren=Native Americans, goblins=black hip/hop culture mixed with Jewish stereotypes. 

I get that this game is over a decade old and that it's neigh-impossible for Blizzard to gut the lore of the game at this point to reflex the diversity of today's society. It's just bothersome that the Warcraft universe has gotten so big with very few people taking the time over the years to raise issue with this design. Trying to remain neutral on the movie, but the trailer leaves me with little hope. Seems there were very few people of color casted in this movie (I'm looking at extras and side-characters mostly because I know that sticking to lore means that most of the Alliance main characters will be white). 

I must say though, that I know Legendary and Duncan Jones knew what they were dealing with getting in to this. I think it was a good move to have the orc characters played by white actors. Would be a major insult to have the only actors of color be made to only play the beast races. It's bad enough that the only black actor I've heard of in the movie (Paula Patton) was cast as Garona (a half orc).",2015-11-09T14:32:13.000Z,0

You basically judge a whole UNIVERSE based on 2 min trailer. But now I understand why the majority of the movies shows their ENTIRE story in the trailer. Its because people are experts and they don't need to watch the movie in order to know what is what. 

Oh and i'm really sad that Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones and ect ect movies are incredibly popular because of their ""effects"" used in the movies, while big old LotR had such huge success because of it's CGI. 

And yes, Warcraft is all about the LOVE.

About the ripoff, yes Warcraft is a ripoff from LotR, Appes, Avatar, its Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey ripoff cause of its haters, also Star Wars ripoff since other planets are included.

Yet the trailer gets vast of views every next hour, but I'm guessing its the WoW fanboys, who live in their basements, hits the reply button all day long.",2015-11-09T12:37:22.000Z,1

This also  brings  a lot of memory having played the first Warcraft: Orcs and Humans as a RTS game when it was first released in 1994. 
 I  appreciate what the director ( Duncan Jones) has done for this upcoming movie. Thank you for using the first Warcraft RTS game as the starting point as it will give the audience a bit of background of how it all started.

Hopefully it will be a box office, so that they can continue to make the sequels based on the later Warcraft games ( Warcraft 2 : Tides of Darkness and Warcraft 3: Realm of Chaos/Frozen Throne)",2015-11-09T11:18:13.000Z,0

Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Released in November 1994
                            
The fallen titan Sargeras plotted to scour all life from Azeroth, thus he possessed the human sorcerer Medivh and compelled him to contact Gul'dan, an orc warlock. With the help of demonic servants of the Burning Legion, they corrupted the once - peaceful orcs and forge them into a bloodthirsty army known as the Horde. This cursed force invaded Azeroth through the Dark Portal, a dimensional gateway created by Medivh and Gul'dan, and clashed with the human nation of Stormwind. Aided by the half-orc Garona, human champions like Anduin Lothar fought valiantly to protect their kingdom....",2015-11-08T21:54:51.000Z,2

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Just a little information for those who may be arguing about this:

Warcraft is heavily influenced by Dungeons and Dragons, like the vast majority of all fantasy video games regardless of genre.

Dungeons and Dragons was heavily influenced by The Lord of the Rings, like the majority of all fantasy settings.

Thus Warcraft IS ""aping"" The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit; but so has every other high fantasy epic since 1937. 

So rather than getting into a pissing contest bitching about source material or literary ancestors, lets all agree to see if this movie succeeds or fails on its own rights, because at this point there is no such thing as an ""original"" fantasy epic, period. 

As for me, I'm squarely in camp ""not bad, I'll wait for some reviews.""",2015-11-08T20:03:59.000Z,0

THis movie is not  sherlock holms type, it has though a fantastic 10 years of lore, that  a small part of it will  be implemented in the movie. orcs looked beyond good and exceeded my expectations. As for the human costumes, they are following the story and how it  has always been we cant change the colour from blue to rasty grey just to be more realistick .ALLIANCE WEARS BLUE U DUMBFUCKS. And stop comparing  to LOTR orcs here are a completely different thing and not at the size of the fuking humans. Durotan looks  awesome by the way.

U dont think it wil be good? DOnt fuking watch u plebs, this movie will do allright wether u like it or not sad bunch of whinings fucks",2015-11-08T17:59:49.000Z,1

I know you can't condense all the lore of Azeroth into a two hour film, but I feel like this trailer is oversimplifying it. For one thing, I know the original Warcraft was just about humans and orcs, but I don't think I saw a single non-human, non-orc character in this trailer. Just because the plot is about two races doesn't mean the other races can't at least make an appearance.",2015-11-08T13:13:22.000Z,0

In all these films, the main characters which will be only  on one side, the audience will understand that the Horde and Alliance are not bad. If it made the first film about the Alliance, be sure to have all associated with both the Horde is forces of darkness. It is not clear how it will present that part of the orcs was intoxicated with the blood of demons. I would like to see the bloodthirsty orcs (Grommash), which became hostages of the situation, even with the slightest hint of guilt, to develop the storyline in the next film. One the other hand, it is not necessary to copy the recent games addon (WoW). In general, ""Whatever happens""! :)))",2015-11-08T09:03:56.000Z,0

One time, a cop was just chilling at home, watching T.V. Then, the cop heard loud noises, coming from people that he assumed were neighbors, outside. The cop then proceeded to get out of his chair and put on his uniform, by the front door. Afterwards, the cop went outside, to get in his car and drive around the neighborhood, with beam lights on. While the cop was driving, he heard loud noises, which lead him to find a bunch of people that were in a dark alleyway of some sort, with them looking suspicious. The cop then turns on the sirens to alert the people that the cop is going to find out what they are up to, but all of them except 1 ran away. The cop asked this one person ""why did those other people run away,"" then the person showed him a drug called crystal meth and so, the cop got the idea that those other people were either drug dealers, or that one of them was a drug dealer. The good thing for the person holding crystal meth is that, he didn't get in trouble, because the cop was off duty, plus the cop got a good laugh out of the situation.",2015-11-08T04:23:57.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I don't hate this movie, not in the least. People, especially geeks, aren't known for being satisfied with anything. I mean complaining about CG orcs? Warcraft Orcs are gorillas, there is no way CGless humans could do it without either looking strikingly different from their in-game counter parts (we're talking animated The Hobbit orcs to live action The Hobbit differences) or looking bogged down and clumsy as they struggle with ten pounds of make-up on their face alone. 

What I will say, however, is that I distinctly remember a Blizzcon movie panel way back were they talked about the movie. The primary discussion was that they had thought about doing Warcraft 1 but had dismissed the idea as cliche'. They said orcs v humans had been done and warcraft had better things to bring to the fantasy genre. Cut five odd years later and what do I see...

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Being an old school Warcraft player (which included playing¬†the original Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, 1994¬†game on two floppy disks). I feel I should assist some of the younger players, and others, who started playing the World of Warcraft¬†series from 2004 onwards, and may not be familiar with the earlier lore. This movie will be mainly based around the time frame of the original Orcs and Humans game (to the best of my knowledge).¬†These¬†events¬†occurred¬†30¬†(in-game years) before¬†the World of Warcraft story chapter¬†began,¬†¬†and deals with the first conflict between the race of men and Orcs, after the opening of the¬†'Dark Portal',¬†which subsequently begins the 'First War'.¬†The opening of the Dark Portal was orchestrated by Medivh, the Last Guardian, and Gul'dan and his shadow council. Gul'dan, as most of you probably know, had been influenced by the Demon Kil'jaeden, to consume his demonic blood, and in turn, corrupted the other orc clans, which imbued them with increased strength and rage. Gul'dan then installed a ""puppet"" Chieftain, Blackhand, to lead the newly formed¬†'Horde' through the portal¬†into Azeroth.¬†The warchief of the Frostwolf Clan, Durotan, convinced that Gul'dan would destroy their¬†people, spoke out against Gul'dan.¬†Because of Durotan's popularity, Gul'dan exiled Durotan and his clan, and¬†they were one of the first clans to travel through the portal.¬†Once the Horde entered Azeroth and initiated conflict with the kingdom of Stormwind, ruled by King Llane,¬†so began the First War between Orcs and Humans.¬†We need to keep in mind that the Orcs had only just entered the human world of Azeroth in this period, so they have yet to encounter the Ogres and Trolls (who are both native to Azeroth), and do not enslave the Dragon brood until the 'Second War', which is around 6 years later. Comparatively, on the human side, this conflict only contained the¬†military forces of Stormwind, led by Lord Lothar, and as such,¬†did not include any Dwarven, Gnomish or Elven forces as yet. The 'Alliance' was not formed until the Second War, which¬†events are played out in¬†Blizzard's¬†Warcraft ll: The Tides of Darkness 1995 PC game.¬†I will leave any further details out¬†in case I inadvertently reveal any spoilers for those who are unfamiliar with the¬†Warcraft lore of this period.",2015-11-08T03:23:47.000Z,1

Judging from this trailer it looks like the director, perhaps even with Blizzard sanctioned approval, has made some creative liberties with the story. Now of course we only see things in the books from certain key character's perspectives during certain times, so perhaps what I've seen from the trailer is just the 'filling in' of the gaps. Which is what I hope it was, because otherwise I think there is going to be a lot of ret-coning, either of the original story or the movie will not be cannon, in which case that sucks.",2015-11-08T02:39:24.000Z,1

I totally win! But honestly this looks like they've glossed over the entire Burning Crusade story and the reason for the Orcs invasion. Green Orcs are their but they're barely noticed.

The reason the orcs look like they do is because its from Warcraft, not LOTR and they obviously want them to look as close to the game as possible - close to Warlords of Draenor - in order to not piss off the real fans. 

I'm really looking forward to this now even if I wanted Blizzard to make the Warcraft movie on their own, with their historically top of the table CGI sequences and cinematic trailers. I'd rather have no real life actors at all, but meh, I think it'll be allright. I wonder how they've mixed up the lore from the first two games here, and if any of the Burning Legion is part of it (Mannorath/Gul'Dan for example).




Oh, and.. Did they really go baby-moses in Warcraft with the floating baby-orc scene? If so, FU Hollywood and your desperate religious propaganda. Its like like Prometheus all over again with that stupid ass cross necklace. It drives me bonkers..!",2015-11-08T02:11:19.000Z,1

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Riddle me this: 

Why is it that out of all the amazing production companies, VFX studios, actors, producers, directors, etc., they chose overall to go this route. WoW is by far one of the biggest MMORPG's with an incredibly huge fan base. A lot of money flows through our pockets and into Blizzard's. Can you imagine if a studio such as MARVEL were to take on a project like this? It would look one million times better in every way, shape, and form. (I realize MARVEL is their own entity and wouldn't do something like this, but you get my point.) 

It just blows my mind that a movie with an incredibly large potential such as a WoW movie would be cut short with the cheapest end of crap pole. I'm pretty bummed, really doesn't look that good at all. Why don't they just make a full length film with the same graphics as the cinematics? That would be a far better option even. Idk, that's how I feel about it. I still hope they do well,  but it could have been better for sure.",2015-11-07T23:56:30.000Z,1

From what I see they might be merging some lore of Warcraft 1 and 2 together, with Durotan helping destroy the dark portal, freeing some humans from being murdered in that cage, Orgrim and him clash, Durotan knows he might die so he sends Draka and Thrall away to Hillsbrad, where she gets killed by assassins, Durotan directly challenges Gul'dan in a mak'gora (As seen in the frame where he punches a spiked green orc)  gets killed, Orgrim kills Blackhand, becomes the official warchief and Gorona kills Llane. In the sequel the antagonist is Ner'zhul (He's  in the middle of the trailer. And kinda Orgrim who's gone more bitter after Durotan died, in that last battle he kills Anduin but the alliance  beats the horde and camps them up. This where thrall comes in the sequel with older Orgrim and Grom",2015-11-07T22:02:35.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"People, this movie is based of the first Warcraft ever made, Not WoW. Undead and Night Elf weren't even introduced until Warcraft 3. This movie is based on the Orcs vs Humans game released in 1994.

Additionally, why do you people always feel the need to complain about CGI? Sure, It may be annoying in a movie that is supposed to be realistic, but remember this is based off of a game made over 20 years ago with fictional characters! IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK ANIMATED! Go look outside. Orcs don't fucking exist. 

From the looks of this trailer and the cinematics made by Blizzard in the past, this series has tremendous movie potential. Some of you need to stop talking out of your ass. This is how original Warcraft is supposed to be portrayed.",2015-11-07T21:18:06.000Z,1

But the point is, in the scene where Draka (female orc with the baby) is putting Go'el/Thrall (Baby Green Jesus) in the water, that isnt apart of the rise of the Horde book. What actually is supposed to happen is that Thrall is found under Draka and Durotan after being chased and killed. The humans find Thrall and take him back to the internment camps. I just wonder if they will bring the camps into this movie, and if they will bring Blackmoore into this, I am thinking it's the guy who states ""They are beasts."" but I won't say for certain.",2015-11-07T21:07:51.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Why do I get the feeling that I've seen this setup before?... You have the two extremes, one on each side of the conflict that just wants to eradicate the other. These are the bad guys. And then you have the third group, the few people from each side that wants to make peace with the other. 

From the lore in Warcraft, I kinda expected something else. I didn't expect this third group to step in and take the stereotypical role of ""the good guys"", in opposition to the stereotypical role of ""the bad guys"". I guess I just expected a movie about a conflict more alike that between the Empire and the Stormcloaks in The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. Where the whole ordeal is in the grey area, instead of making it completely obvious who the bad guys are and who the good guys are.

I hope I'm just over-analyzing the trailer and that my assumptions are wrong, due to the fact that I haven't seen the movie yet. I'm definately going to give it a shot, no matter what, because if nothing else, it looks like a piece of art.",2015-11-07T20:56:26.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I think the CGI for Warcraft looks absolutely terrible. It took me right out of the trailer. 

1.They should have focused more on practical effects and real locations. It looks like the non CGI characters are standing in front of a green screen. 
2. CGI characters don't work on screen with real people. It looked bad in the Hobbit and it looks even worse in this trailer.
3. I think The LOTR Trilogy's Orks worked best because there were actual people in makeup. With Warcraft and The Hobbit its like watching a CGI game cut scene mixed with live action. 

I'll pass on this movie but it's all subjective. If that works for some people that's cool too but I'm gonna save my money. I'm sure there will be a DC, Star Wars, or Marvel  movie I can watch instead.",2015-11-07T20:41:54.000Z,7

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I look forward to seeing this movie! This trailer just pumped me up to see this <3

One thing only bugs me is this: you fans. It just bothers me to see you all complain about it. Look, I might not know much of this series, this world, and so forth... but looking up the backstory of the movie... it's about the BEGINNING of this whole thing, which is totally understandable. There could be more movies in the future that will bring it up to where it is at now for the games or whatnot.

Get over it. To me, you all are a little too hardcore for this series, the games, and etc. Just be grateful they're making a movie for it, even a movie SERIES if it comes to it. I, for one, am looking forward to seeing it. I love the trailer, I love the effects, I love everything. I just cannot wait to see it.

I am only a year in, mayber 2 (since this year was the only time I got really into it once I got the game to work again after the latest game pack. Since that game was released my graphics card had to be updated in order to play again, and I've been in 2 months in again after half a year last year playing it) and I love the series, the gameplay... haven't done dungeons and all that others stuff against and with other players... I just love playing the game, seeing different creatures and monsters and going through many of the lands. It's just absolutely amazing. 

Don't get overly hardcore about this movie and what your ""expectations"" are, this movie is about the START of it all, the ORIGINS. All this stuff you want to see would possibly be shown in later movies. Once you think about it, it makes sense.

Have a nice day (I won't be replying back to anywho who comments this, cause I am not gonna bother making points, agreeing or arguing. I am just a simple loving world of warcraft gamer who simply loves the games and playing it for fun. I am not a hardcore person against or with other players online, I just play for fun).",2015-11-07T19:43:56.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Being a huge fan of the books and an old fan of the games, I am indifferent on this. With Christopher Metzen working on it I have a feeling it will still be a great movie since Chris was the one working on a lot of the storyline for the games in the first place...

On the flip side, I feel that the movie is trying to focus a lot on the action and what they think people want to see. The storyline is amazing, it does not need anything extra to appeal to the audience. To me, the story of warcraft surpasses LOTR by far, but if they make it too heavily focused on the fighting and combat (like half of this trailer shows) then I don't believe it will be a great movie. 

My summary: If the movie follows the storyline like it should, then it should be a great movie. If the whole movie is just like this trailer, then it will flop. 

Also, Warcraft 2 and 3 get even better (the timeline and the games). If this movie doesn't suck but doesn't really do great either, I hope they will continue and make a sequel. No matter what, if a sequel is made, it will be better.",2015-11-07T19:20:02.000Z,0

Even if this movie fail, which it shouldn't seeing how Blizzard can just pay for their own film without the financial backing of Hollywood, the subscription base for their game WOW would surge regardless. Now that I think back on it, I remember Blizzard carefully cutting off bad directors and whatnots, I didn't really cared about it back then, but after seeing this trailer it changed my mind. GOOD MOVE!

My feels says, this is just a big CGI trailer for their game. But, Holy shit, if they ever decide on making movies just for their new expansion packs.",2015-11-07T19:13:12.000Z,0

It has the lore already there (like LotR), and has the ever changing world (World of Warcraft), so this could be a multi installation movie series. But, like any movie, this can be fucked up REAL quick if not done properly. The First War is definitely the proper starting place. At least they aren't trying to do some sequel to the prequel to the preprequel nonsense (again, this is only the first movie they dropped for this as of yet, so I'm stating very hopeful).

They could have told the Warcraft 1 history in a 3 - 4 minute historical synopsis - think LOTR, The Fellowship of the Ring. LOTR didn't go back to tell the story that only LOTR die-hards will know....which is what Warcraft has done....NOBODY cares about the original story of orcs and humans. This is another stupid dumb-jock warrior douche-bag with a sword movie....AND there is so much more to WoW. Example: most of the races that make WoW different and unique are left out. I predict this movie will bomb....much like the launch of Pandaria in China was an epic failure. NO....there will NOT be a sequel since this trash will be a monumental failure in the box office.

The story of this movie seems to take place somewhat before the events of Warcraft 1, and during Warcraft 1.

Human good. Orc bad."".

Considering the source material being as bare bones as it gets, I'm surprised that this movie actually looks as complicated as it is.

I am vfx artist working on movies just like this.. So if you expect it to be fixed by June 10th there is a little chance - (the problem lies mostly in the ""lighting"" from what i saw - the material shaders for the CGI) To fix this they need to go back to CG render.. tweak the settings/change the lights re-render - and after that, it needs to go to compositing department- tweak here and there to match the new comp.. (for each shot) - and CG rendering is allot time consuming.. speaking hours of render time per frame (on ordinary PC).. 
I think even if they wanted they wouldn't have the time to do it..

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Here's an analytical approach to why I can instinctually tell this is a terrible movie:

‚Ä¢ This story is based on the human-orc conflicts from the earliest, least-developed, least interesting parts of the Warcraft franchise. Where are the more exotic creatures?
‚Ä¢ Movie audiences have been fatigued of high-fantasy epic war movies long since all the movies that tried to be the next _Lord of the Rings_. This movie is 15 years late and even so feels extremely watered-down compared to things like LOTR.
‚Ä¢ Dialogue and plot premise is *excruciatingly clich√©*. No one will be invested in such a routine, formulaic story that they've seen a million times before.
‚Ä¢ Blizzard games have never really been character-driven stories. I guarrantee no one will relate to or care about these characters and by extension won't care about the story altogether.
‚Ä¢ Shayamalan's Avatar the Last *Airbender-calibre actors*.
‚Ä¢ Wolves, griffins, tusk-bearing, pointy-eared orcs, et cetera give this a cringey furry vibe.
‚Ä¢ Videogamey / cartoony physics are so unrealistic that the audience can't predict how a fight will turn out. For example, tiny human knights realistically have no chance against an Incredible Hulk-like orc. The outcomes of fights are at the arbitration of the writers, so there's *no tension*, which is crucial to action movies. Since fights themselves won't advance the story, the audience will be bored waiting for them to end.
‚Ä¢ This film has a weak prospective audience, likely insufficient to turn a profit. It's best bet seems to be 10 year old boys who don't recognize or care about a movie being garbage, along with the parents who bring them. Video game nostalgia won't be enough to draw a decent audience to the theatres because it's very franchise-specific, as opposed to something like _Wreck-it-Ralph_ which celebrates videogames in general. _Wreck-it-Ralph_ is also, crucially, _actually_ a good movie.

I have doubts that this movie will turn a profit. I have few doubts that it will receive single-digit ratings on RottenTomatoes and Metacritic.",2015-11-07T16:22:50.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"A few points that I feel need to be added for all haters out there:
1. The movie isn't about World of Warcraft, it's plot is derived from the original Warcraft 1
2. The story has been around for over 20 years, the lore of the Warcraft universe is enormous
3. There aren't any undead, gnomes, night elves, pandaren, etc... because at that point in time they haven't been introduced in the story, so stop asking for them, it's illogical
4. Green screens had to be used for the settings, this isn't an enormous budget blockbuster so don't expect it to look like a full HD LotR. They wanted to give it a game-ish vibe with the tone and style and I think they did a great job at that
5. They used a combination of live action and CGI for the orcs
6. Both the humans and orcs look not only faithful to the source material but amazingly realistic and any other comment on that is pure ranting
7. Regarding all the comments about it not being ""a huge budget blockbuster"" and ""Jurassic Park, Star Wars: Phantom Menace and Lord of the Rings: Return of the Kings not being blockbusters in that case because they were made with less money"" you need to take into account the fact that money changes it's value rather quickly. 100 million in the time LotR was made would equivalate to over 200 million in today's economy, the Hobbit movies (lesser versions of the original trilogies) being proof of this.


Seriously, I don't get all the non-WoW players ranting on this trailer. What did you expect? An Oscar worthy period piece about a veteran dealing with racism and alcoholism shot in lazy pan cams and close ups of characters staring out of a window in slow motion? It's a fantasy....gosh. I get the feeling people have been so spoiled by all the movies that came out that noting can satisfy anyone anymore...nitpick nitpick nitpick.

I only played warcraft 2 and 3, never been a huge fan of the universe and graphic style, but the visuals here convince me they really tried hard to make those orcs look believable, even though they still look like ponytailed hulk with boar teeth...

Let's give it a chance, it might be at least the first and most decent movie adaptation of a video game so far.

I care more about this movie being close to the lore than his crappy CGI, you had one job and that was not to fuck up the lore, I hope I'm mistaken but from what I've seen and after picking Travis Fimmel an actor thats picking up quite some hype to play a character that well...

Even if it is pure CGI, so what?  Haven't we been praising Blizzard's cinematics for a decade, wishing for a full length feature.  Well, here you go.  Toy Story is fully CGI, I don't hear a lot of complaining.  It will be hard for people to relate to Orcs.  Honestly I'd rather have these orcs than Lord of the Rings orcs, which were nothing but monsters.  I think this has very good potential.",2015-11-07T15:31:24.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Universal is going to butcher this movie with it's marketing. It is afraid of it and doesn't how to market it and may totally ruin it by showing it as another 'Lord of the Rings'. And that's a shame because warcraft is a great franchise and totally worth a cinematic retelling of its story. And also, our reactions are mixed because of the blend of cgi and human actors, and because of the character designs. Everything looks too surreal to comprehend at once. I personally hope this movie is going to be great and i found the trailer fine and with some captivating visuals. It could have been better if it avoided the cliched dialogue it's characters speak throughout. Also the fact that it has tv stars( not to increase budget obviously) and not at least a couple of big name actors in it is another kind of trouble. I really like Travis Fimmel but he is doing the same smirks in this as he does in Vikings and in every other movie he has been in.

This looks awfully generic and lame. Not to mention that the trailer is there to show off the exciting bits. Can't imagine the rest :(

Visual concepts from the 90's (all super-clean, even in the middle of a battle, ridiculous unrealistic animations), unbelievably lame and predictable scenario in every bits shown (Oh wooow somebody has a love affair with a chick from the enemy side and she will apparently help to free her beloved prisoner!  Oh my god I never saw that before, it's so exciting... ). Even the acting looks bad in the few dialogues shown...

All the wow geeks will rush to watch it so I guess it's just good business. I really expected better from Blizzard though... Not just a bunch of LOTR-inspired scenes, and battles  with very large fights and big stuff flying around.",2015-11-07T14:56:47.000Z,0

However, this better be dark as fuck, the orcs and humans fought very furiously in the original lore and ended up becoming long time enemies, only later on did they humans and orcs unite when Jaina and thrall had to save the world from the demons and so on.

Do we get to see the world tree then too? That be cool.

I remember fantasizing with friends back in the days of wc3 of how awesome a Warcraft movie could be, should they decide to do an actual 1-2 hours long movie. Boy would I be all over that, even today.

So this trailer finally comes up and dispels all the best things I had in mind when I first thought just how much I would like to see an actual warcraft film. It's a live action, quasi-CGI movie, with seemingly little relevance to the rich lore and plot of the established world. Yes Durotan appears, and a few more names may pop up here and there, but it's obviously not the story behind the First War.

Blizzard held the MostAwesomeCinemtics award, in my mind at least, for a long time. Not scoring on that, but instead introducing real actors in some Who Framed Roger Rabbit theme, is possibly the biggest disappointment for me here.

Yes I'll watch it, simply because I like the genre and I'd watch it even if it hadn't anything to do with WC world, but this could have been so much more.",2015-11-07T13:52:36.000Z,0

Unknown Actors, Dialogues are lame as hell, Acting seems B Grade...CGI .. CGI everywhere. I know SFX is very expensive and CGI is way cheaper(in this modern age), but this trailer looks worse than Blizzard's own CGI cutscenes.  
Plot is from the Genesis of the Warcraft lore, which was barely interesting even back in 1990s (total Warhammer 40k ripoff)
I dont know why you all are so hyped. Do you think this movie will be the first successfull Video Game movie? Not in a million years, sorry to burst your bubble.

Tip : *Either make a full 100%  CGI feature film or make a normal movie with SFX . Look at Jurassic World, looks like a friggin cartoon next to the classic Jurassic Park*",2015-11-07T13:37:04.000Z,1

I am offended!"". What I saw - ""Panda bears? Based on wise and ancient culture with emphasies on importance of always doing what is right and calmly deal with hardships of life? Trying to teach me how important it is to fight for what I belive in, treat everyone and everything with respect, and act calmly to deal with my inner demons? I like it"".

-For people who might not know the orc who fights with the humans is Durotan and in the original story a bit after opening the dark portal Gul'dan who leads the horde (from shadows) send all the Frostwolfs a.k.a Durotans clan to exile and by that they dont take much role in the First and Second War
-Durotan's son a.k.a Thrall a.k.a Green Jesus who is shown to be left in a river by his mother Draka is actually found in woods by humans during the 2nd warr near the dead bodies for his parents who died becuase of an ambush after Durotan tryes to reach Orgrim Doomhammer.

Having the story of the first war on screen would be fairly uncoventional as there are a lot of complex elements with the many different assassinations of certain characters.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Am I the only one who after ten years of waiting suddenly fears this movie? I got really excited since the filming of the movie actually began, I watched every piece of footage that was released/leaked and I was really looking forward to seeing this movie...until yesterday. I mean, wtf? They have great books on which they were supposed to build the story, but no, instead we are getting some weird orc-human alliance. What about Garona killing Llane? In the trailer it seems like she just thought to herself: ""Fuck you Medivh, Ragnar Lothbrok is more sexy than you, I feel the sudden need to make him forge an alliance with Durotan."" And the scene with little Thrall, I only hope that the river won't take him straight to Kalimdor, because as far as I am concerned Draka and Durotan should be dead by the time such scene could even happen. I really don't understand the need of movie producers to change major aspects of a well written story when it comes to terms of the movie. Not to mention that every major orc in the trailer is brown instead of green and they all look too human from tusks up and they have face expressions like their muscles are paralysed. I really hope that this bad impression I got from this trailer won't continue into the movie. But I personally think that people who would have appreciated this movie the most are those familiar with the books/games. I understand the need to make it appealing also to those who have no idea what warcraft is, but twisting the story into some stupid clich√© is not the way.",2015-11-07T12:27:29.000Z,0

The buildings, more recognizable places, more references to the game, items, gear, and oh you know, the other half of the game, the  magic? Spells? Any other classes we can sink our teeth into by watching a priest cast a shield or a paladin in shining armor with sparks that fly from his shit when he hits something, or an epic-looking warlock casting demon soul with his fel hunter cruisin up to spell lock you hahahaha I mean it's for us! It's for the players, the nerds, the ones who will recognize as much in-game stuff you can cram into two or however many hours. Recognizable towns, items, throw some profession stuff in there id love to watch a tailor make a flying carpet or see someone pulling herbs while they're out in the wild to help heal the wound. A rogue in stealth? Come on you know that would be sweet. Non-fans would love it because it's cool as all hell to watch, it pops, it'll look good because it looks good in the game,  just more... Depth behind it. They had so much content to play around with and from the looks of it it just doesn't seem like they're taking any advantage. I hope I'm wrong. I wanted an all-out deal. This just looks like 300 with orcs. I love the game, just want to see it done some justice in the end. We'll see. Probably going to be disappointed, but that's alright.",2015-11-07T12:10:39.000Z,0

Let me tell you something. The thing is that they're trying to appeal to literally the ENTIRE Warcraft following..There's absolutely NO way they can do that without suffering from some backlash. It's not like Lord of The Rings, where they're taking what's already been written and reproducing it visually.

They need to try to satisfy what, at least three generations of followers and on top of that, every player that has both kept up with, and dropped off of the series since its release in 1994?! We've only been given one trailer and everybody is jumping to conclusions, and yet, nobody knows the plot!

Could it be everything up to now summed up in God knows how long the movie will be? Maybe.

Could it be the beginning of a Harry Potter-esque franchise? We can only hope.

But we have no idea!

Just be hopeful that it won't be a flop as Final Fantasy was, and be thankful that they're actually attempting to make a movie based on a nostalgic game of yours.

The dialogue might way too cheesy and stiff. it needs a non-self righteous character that's batshit crazy.
If the story is as it is in the trailer, I'll be disappointed, if Gul'dan (which he's been hidden cleverly in the trailer), acts as...well... Gul'dan, and flips the whole story arch on its head by summoning a demonlord or something, then sign me up.

And about when this takes place? This is during the First War, when the Dark Portal was opened the first time and the Orcs first set foot on Azeroth.

Even from watching the trailer, the mixture of the two had the whole thing feeling extremely artificial. When CG characters interacted with other CG characters, it was fine. However, when A real person interacted with a CG character, my brain immediately knew the difference.

inb4: ""JUST GO TO A REAL FANTASY ISLAND THEN HUH??"" First off, that's fucking retarded and people should feel bad for even typing it. The mixture of CG and live action is what i have a problem with. You can make realistic looking orcs without CG, just look at Lord of the Rings. ""BUT THOSE DON'T HAVE THE WARCRAFT STYLE!!!""

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I am wondering if any one else out there is feeling like they DRASTICALLY altered the lore for this movie. It looks like it will be good and I will go see it, but from this first trailer, it really is looking like it they just took characters and locations from the Warcraft universe and just made up their own story for the movie.

From the trailer, it appears as if the Orcs and Humans have yet to meet. Which would put this movie during the first game or the ""First War"". But there appeared to be a floating Dalaran at 1:20, which would put the timeline around Wrath of the Lich King. And to my knowledge, please correct me if I am wrong, but I do not remember any Orcs of any kind cooperating with the Humans (minus Gorona and her story). Also, I know for a fact that none of the Orcs that came through during the first invasion (Warcraft 1-2) were still brown. We didn't see any brown Orcs until Burning Crusade. I also think the logo on the banners the Orcs are using did not exist until the Third War, but feel free to correct me on that one as I am not 100% sure on it.

Plenty of other things I could probably nit-pick if I wanted to, but I won't. I will go see it and am excited for it, and we really can't say anything about the story until AFTER we see the full movie, but I am really hoping it sticks close to the current timeline or is an entirely different timeline and isn't supposed to be 100% based off the one we already know. It is also possible that they could have retconned some stuff. Blizzard has been doing that since........forever? Burning Crusade is the first time I know they really started retconning stuff.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Well, it looks like they're trying to appeal to the masses instead of their fans, so it's going to be watered down and unfortunately average. But, you know, warcraft is far beyond its prime anyways, I kinda figured it'd just never get a movie. I'll still end up watching it, if only to be sure it's as bland as it looks like it will be, and hey, maybe if I just try to look past the waste of amazing source material it'll seem like an alright movie.
I'd almost be interested in a saga of warcraft movies, but I doubt they'd be able to really capture the same feeling as the games. I mean, by warcraft three there's already so much important lore that it's just not feasible to squish that into a 90 minute hollywood action film.
I guess to really sum up my thoughts on the movie, I'm not impressed by the trailer, but I'm not really let down because my expectations weren't all that high to begin with.",2015-11-07T08:33:29.000Z,0

It's supposed to look overly bold and almost cartoony sort of like the game. I think they made an intentional choice not to make the orcs or the creatures look photorealistic. Instead they're trying to make the live action people blend in with it by giving them bulky ornate videogame armor. They still look noticeably more real than everything else though. It's a little jarring, but an interesting choice I haven't seen before.",2015-11-07T08:18:35.000Z,29

They director stated from the beginning ""We will capture the soul of the game and do the game justice."" The game has cartoony graphics. It has never been realistic and it never will. So how in the world would this do the game justice if the orcs were realistic? And I mean, they look realistic enough to be standing next to a non-cg person and you accept it. That's awesome! Exactly how it should be! But they really captured the soul, wibe and overall aesthetic of the warcraft universe. It looks colourful, cartoony, but still realistic.

The orcs look like they've stepped out of a GOOD cutscene, and CGI allows filmmakers to do things that practical effects cannot, and it's high time we stop hating them for that.

Period. Green orcs are the trademark of Warcraft for me, when I think ""Warcraft"" I think a big green monster in barbarian armor with an axe. (granted, this image was stolen from Warhammer... but at least own up to it!) This way they just look like buff tan humans with fangs. Next. The story is very generic. There wasn't a single phrase spoken in the trailer that made me feel hooked or want to know what's gonna happen. ""Let go of the racial hate and [optionally] unite against a common foe"" yadda yadda a.k.a. one of the oldests cliches in the book. Third. Too much CG. Now I'm usually a proponent of CG in every argument, but even to me this looks fake. Did they even use real-life locations to film this? Why couldn't they use prosthetics/make up to make the close-up orcs? LotR did it 15 years ago, FFS!
Now I'll sit tight for Blizzard to change the whole movie several months before release just to suit my taste. Oh wait.",2015-11-07T06:15:25.000Z,10
2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"having never played the game or know any of the backstory, nor do i really give a damn about all that, all i have to go on is the trailer itself. that said, it looks more interesting than most of the fantasy bullshit we've seen lately, i just wish it wasn't so CGI'ed (not that it looks bad, especially for a 'mere' $100M movie, although it does, imo, look more like a videogame than a movie, or 'jack the giant slayer' quality at best). 

i hope it does well, but these movies seem to be getting clobbered in the box office (the marvel movies notwithstanding). at least this one seems to have a compelling story, but these kinds of movies are hard to pull off. director duncan jones (david bowie's son) is an interesting choice.",2015-11-07T06:14:39.000Z,4

‚Ä¢ Gryphon CGI could have been better
‚Ä¢ Stormwind armor looks highly decorative with bright colors and odd, impractical shapes
‚Ä¢ Travis Fimmel was great in Vikings, but I'm not feeling it with him playing this role
‚Ä¢ Garona doesn't look half-orc, half-draenei. Looks more like full human with fangs and green skin
‚Ä¢ Looks like many of the interesting elements of the Warcraft story were scrapped to fit hollywood stereotypes and push the horde into the ""good guy, bad situation"" category.

Since the trailer wasn't super flashy, it might mean they're holding their best stuff for the release.  Blizzard, after all, wanted this movie to do well, and showing the best stuff up front might've ruined the movie.

All of the Man-Babies are going to weigh in with their opinion on this movie. The Man-Baby opinion will likely be negative if not at least skeptical. But what the Man-Baby doesn't realize, is that sometimes it's not about him. Sometimes a movie is for the kids too. Kids don't possess the same perpetual doubt and disappointment that that the Man-Baby does. They're not jaded from years of getting most of what they wanted, yet complaining about how it's wasn't perfect. Man-Baby's are ever-thirsty for the best thing they've ever had. They are ants caught in a hopeless ice cream swirl of their own narcissism and nostalgia. Many of them won't make it through winter without someone to warm their balls. 

Someone like you. 

For just 10 cents a day, you can help a Man-Baby warm their balls during these frigid months and minimize their complaints through the next media cycle.

There are a lot of dicks here thinking it's about WOW. I've been playing Warcraft (RTS) series for years, always dreamed about watching it on the big screens. I don't care, it's the essence and the spirit of Warcraft and it's the only thing that really matters for me.
Pretty much, all fantasy stories has gained more life after The Lord of the Rings, and Warhammer and Warcraft are not different, as well as D&D. 
Real Fantasy and Warcraft lovers know exactly what I'm talking about, I suppose, so let's just wait and check the movie. However, if you don't appreciate or get curious about checking it with your own eyes, just walk away, let it go.",2015-11-07T04:52:52.000Z,2

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"To be honest it just looks not good (enough). The CGI is just slightly better than the cinematics of Blizzard Entertainment. The backgrounds look cheap, the armors are ridiculous. The mixture of real people with animated orcs (obviously) is terrible in this case. And I predict that the story will be as good as the CGI else the trailer was set up differently. It is an attempt to translate Warcraft into a movie with real people. We actually see Legendary Pictures having (semi) interest in making a decent movie. It could have been worse. But it is not sadisfying. Im judging by what I see plus my knowledge of how trailers, teasers and movies work. My conclusion: It's an attempt. Noone was interested in making a good movie based on a game franchise so far. There are hopes for future films. Was it animated like all the cinematics from Blizzard, well then this case would have been a different story. Completely.",2015-11-07T04:48:01.000Z,1

I want to see a very brief scene with some high commander (King Llane, or Lothar maybe) overlooking a heated battle from on high. For just a moment, the camera should be looking as if from his eyes, his gauntleted hand pointing down to the chaos below and waving around as if making commands.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Ragnar! I'll check this movie out when it goes straight to DVD. This movie is AKA Warhammer the movie, as Warcraft is 100% 'inspired' aka Ripped Off from Warhammer. Blizzard had a contract to make Warhammer into a PC game in the early 90s. When the contract fell through Blizzard realized it's cheaper to just use Orcs vs Humans as no one owns Orcs. But they went above and beyond a generic Orcs vs Humans story and directly ripped off storyline names character locations from the Warhammer universe. So this movie will be a watered down version of Warhammer or the crappy 'story' that Warcraft is. On top of that Hollywood probably turned crap into super concentrated crap. So it looks visually interesting, maybe little kids will like it.",2015-11-07T04:15:31.000Z,1

The story is an awesome extract from the warcraft story, very good for the first movie introducing the world and the races. I think the conflict between war and unity of orcs and humans against each other or together against the burning legion(gul'dan) allows a further development in the next movies. 

Sadly most of the people who played the game can't even name one character showed in this trailer because they dont give a shit about the lore of warcraft. In my opinion these people are spreading the hate and pessimism here in the comments.
Just all calm down, it's just a game, it's just a movie and I think most of the people who played the game will enjoy the movie :)",2015-11-07T04:12:43.000Z,0

The humans in Warcraft never take in outsiders.  That is why the Undead were banished.  Humans and the Alliance in general are usually stuck up bastards with a knack for killing anything not like them.  They are the ""bad guys"".  But I may be biased since I played Horde ever since the days of vanilla WoW.  Undead first then Blood Elf with the Burning Crusade expansion came out.  Stopped playing after Cataclysm.  Ruined the whole game for me.  This movie looks good CGI wise but I am not feeling the storyline.  Maybe they will take it back to Warcraft: Orcs and Humans.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Just my two cents but the CGI and live action in this movie look horribly juxtaposed. It feels even WORSE than ""The Hobbit"" series. You know, the one that made mother fucking Ian Mckellen, a literally honor bound knight, cry on set due to its wildly unproportionate sections of cgi instead of practical effects. and to those saying ""qq more if it were all live action it would be shit"", no actually, the first LOTR movies were mostly practical effects/make-up and were MUCH better off than the hobbit ones that proceeded them, at least imo.

Maybe im being cynical but this trailer really lets me down in terms of the quality and polish I would expect from a usual Warcraft cinematic. Plastic pauldrons, overly typical dialogue, horrible Garona makeup, infant green jesus looking comPLETELY out of place. Shit, I was so hyped that this movie was finally being produced after being in production hell for over 8 years, but... well lets just say I wont be holding my breath.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),The line deliveries in this trailer are terrible.  It's like someone cloned a thousand Haden Christiansen's from Star Wars Attack of the Clones and used them to cast every role in a movie.  Even the CGI characters lines feel stunted and unnatural.  Cringe city.  This is the best set of deliveries they could pick out of the movie to try and sell you a ticket.  Take a moment to think on that before you build your expectations.,2015-11-07T02:07:11.000Z,0

This trailer is really awesome!!, Okay?, I thought the locations were fantastic, I thought that the way they recreated Azeroth was brilliant, even though the orcs might not look good, the CGI feels like if they are real, which is amazing.

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I feel like this is going to have the same issue as The Hobbit where you have real actors playing some orcs and others being CGI and its a really uncomfortable mix just like in Battle of the Five Armies where some of the dwarf characters were CGI standing next to the real actors. I would have preferred if they went heavy one way or the other, I actually wouldn't have minded a full CGI animated movie in the style of the WoW trailers. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't look like a bad movie, but Hollywood needs to seriously re-evaluate the role CGI plays in their productions since it seems to generally be sort of a haphazard deal rather than tactical. I guess we're getting better at it at least, it's just not usually something that stands the test of time.",2015-11-07T01:39:46.000Z,0

But damn, I have so many mixed feelings about this. I'm optimistic because I know the Warcraft lore is so well written and deep. If done well, this could develop into many, _many_ sequels that will have my gaze directed towards the theaters for years to come. However, the amount of CGI and special effects in this trailer deeply disturbs me. Now, I know I'm no director or movie animator, but I am a viewer. And ultimately, it's the _viewers'_ opinion that makes or a breaks a movie and the possibility for sequels. A prime example of this is the Last Airbender. A combination of horrid animation, stiffness, and bad acting made for a complete flop that everyone makes fun of. I just hope the train of hype and opportunity that is centered around this movie franchise isn't derailed by negative opinions of the first film due to the possibility a CGI overload. Other than that, I'm optimistic.",2015-11-07T01:32:13.000Z,4

Why even bother putting such poor lines in the trailer? The narrators in the WoW cinematics are awesome and can explain better to the people who aren't familiar with the game/books.

Here's what discrepancies I managed to gather, Alliance already forming during the First War, Durotan and Draka still alive and are brown, Thrall is not kidnapped but hidden away in a similar fashion to Moses, Lothar and Garona are in love (not sure though), we see an attack on the Dark Portal, which means this movie might be a combination of the First and Second Wars which makes my first point invalid if that's the case.

Blizz has enough $ to own a small country but they couldn't make something more epic than this? C'mon! You're being swindled - a reflective fact which haunts your bank accounts each month.

It must be the best, so it can show people that you can actually create a masterpiece movie after a video game. And also, you have the most loyal fanbase for this movie, even among Star Wars and the new Harry Potter movie.

Good luck and give your absolute best.",2015-11-06T23:55:54.000Z,0

For example, the close-up on durotan at 0:54 is absolutely amazing by cgi standards, but the environments, and some other stuff are not that finished.
 It's amazing how little they want to tell about the story in this trailer and i understand why. Too much insight will spoil some aspects of the film and maybe scare away the new viewers.
This was finished for a deadline, because everyone expected them to release it at blizzcon. I expect nothing but the best from this, the cgi in this movie will be gamechanging.

These orcs or whatever the hell they're supposed to be look so goofy that I just can't take them seriously.

-Humans vs orcs (apes)
-They form a shaky alliance for some common goal
-One of the higher-up humans hates orcs and wants to kill them
-One of the higher-up orcs hates humans and wants to kill them
-Tense scenes until finally one of them snaps and kills someone
-Chaos

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"Dear Blizzard/Universal/Legendary

As the Champion of Stormwind and having played an integral part in defending our great capital against the attack of Deathwing the Destroyer; I would appreciate a role in this film.
I feel as though, being a Champion, I should be played by someone of equivalent status. Gerard Butler perhaps? Idris Elba would also be a good classy choice.
It would be suitable for my character to have a wife who is as strong as she is sexy, sassy and intelligent. Emilia Clarke or even Jennifer Lawrence seem perfect here.
I look forward to seeing who you cast as Stormwind Champion and seeing how you portray my gallantry in the Deathwing attack in whichever sequel that event may be in.

Sincerely
Stormwind Champion.

The best part is that THEY CAN NOT DO NOTHING ABOUT IT! just don't go watch it and that's it.  And that is funny to me, watching them complain like childs, criticizing something that they have not even watched and so. well you either go watch it or not. I myself am exited for this, since i have been waiting since the announcement of a Warcraft movie, and i'm sure a lot of people are.

I really thought this would feel different than other fantasy movies, but now I feel very disappointed that it literally just looks like a carbon copy LotR film because it's classified as ""fantasy"". 2, where is the awesome music like that from WoW, and the Warcraft series? Music like THAT is what this movie needs, not this generic soulless thump-thump almost-dubstep type ""epic"" music. After seeing all these new trailers coming out, this same tone has just seriously killed it for me. Finally, I'm not sure why they did a live-action movie. Blizzard's CGI cinematics are so god damned amazing, that I'm pretty sure just about anyone would have paid to see a movie based graphically on that look and feel of the world. I know I would.

if that was the most thematic line to cut away from, then I fear for this movie's dialogue.  The cgi is also really uncomfortable, and the humans almost feel like they're popping out of the environment, like they're in front of a green screen the entire time.

The scope of the story also feels really limited.  They should be making a 4 hour epic with a sprawling cast, obviously fans of this franchise aren't going to mind sitting through a long-ass movie.  This just feels like Dances with Wolves with orcs.

Throw in the fact that Legendary pictures is making it, and I'm pretty sure we've got another Prince of Persia on our hands.",2015-11-06T20:41:43.000Z,2

I'm torn whether I'm glad or unhappy that I'll be entering the cinema with low expectations, so I'll probably enjoy it. Hopefully, atleast. I'm scared because the CGI looks.. off, and of course the whole Video game movie curse. In all honesty, I think this will be a valiant try to make a Warcraft movie, but will be rather underwhelming and average. It won't be god awful, but won't be getting any 3 and above star reviews. I think. However, from what I can see I'm really looking forward to the evident tale of two sides. Looks like it came off decently.

I do wish they had gone all CGI like the early Warcraft cinematics, cause those were always super well done. But, nevertheless, I'm pretty impressed with what I see so far. Now I just hope the story is compelling.",2015-11-06T20:37:26.000Z,0

This trailer made me think of Eragon or the Golden Compass. As those two, it's a franchise with a great lore, but it will be destroyed by a pile of cliche because they want to please all audiences. It's a nerdy movie, accept it! Look at the Guardian of the Galaxy! They embraced the nerdiness and it was a great movie.

So, right now, it's just a ""meh!"" for me.",2015-11-06T20:13:52.000Z,0

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"There is some hope I think, I only have a basic understanding of the WoW lore because I only played for about a month but it has the chance to be a pretty good fantasy flick, the CGI is still in very early stages here and it is Weta after all so the slightly off effects should be improved by its June release, the orcs look very crisp though if not very cartoony. We've seen from Weta's previous work that they are great with more practical effects, costumes and make up so the choice to rely heavily on it is slightly disappointing. A slightly bothering problem though is the casting, they have gone with regular American actors with smooth voices when something like this should have people with more distinct appearances and voices, I feel more something more Northern would work better. With the simularities this trailer has to trailers for other fantasy/action films that were failed messes is off-putting but I will definitely keep my eye on this",2015-11-06T20:13:28.000Z,0

Having all the human characters looking like a captain from the Mist of Pandaria cinematic would be a perfect, yet very expensive dream come true, I know. But some of the shots they present in trailer already don't work, I hope at least post production for the first movie is still in process... coz right now it looks like the movie is just a few steppes away from looking as the next big thing, based not just on the fans' expectations.",2015-11-06T20:06:32.000Z,1

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"I've been playing Blizzard games since I was a child starting with WC2.  I started WoW in middle school and am still playing out of undergrad.  Blizzard games connected me with my best friends even after I moved across the US.  I attribute Blizzard to still having a good relationship with my childhood friend today because we kept in contact and had a way to still connect.  My best friend died just before WOTLK and clocked in 127 days game time.  I transferred his character to my acct so in a way a part of him keeps on, particularly since WoW was something we all obsessed over.  We heard talk of a warcraft movie back then and I'm so happy that it's finally coming out now.  I don't care if the lore isn't exact or consistent necessarily, Warcraft is like a legend, it's ok to change some of the details.  I think the trailer looked amazing (I think some gamers have a stick up their ass and can never be happy with anything as well), I've already watched it three times and will certainly see it in theaters many times more and hope for success and a continuation of the rest of the Warcraft legends.  bless you Blizzard, Lok tar O'gar",2015-11-06T20:01:52.000Z,0

Edit: As alot of people have mentioned they can still do alot to make it look better before it releases. What i was confused about was just why it looked so good at some points in the trailer, and so bad at others: see 1:36, it leaves me very confused, and slightly worried. Im still gonna watch it and will probally love it, i just hope they make it look good :)",2015-11-06T20:01:50.000Z,258

2015-11-06T19:26:46.000Z,2Rxoz13Bthc,Warcraft - Official Trailer (HD),"This seems like a beautiful and enjoyable badass film. 

Those of you who talk about a cliche scenario must probably be the ones who don't get that cinema films don't always need heavy drama, incredibly complex too deep scenarios, social and world commentaries off our real world or too edgy, depressing themes. If the actors and the narrative in combination with the music and the cgi are given in balanced numbers then any action flick can be a really good film for the audience. 

This is gonna be an epic fantasy story about the Horde and the Alliance fighting and getting over it, probably both losing with Survival and Racism being the main concept. Deal with it and watch it or do not watch it and don't destroy the happiness of other fans with your overly complex paragraphs about too deep cinema and social justice perception :"").",2015-11-06T19:53:46.000Z,4

I've hoped for something similar to LotR, but after this trailer I don't think it'd be anywhere near that

Also just have to say this. female orc is the worst idea ever happen. I know they made female orc for the sake of WoW gameplay but still that's the wrost thing ever. There should never be female Orc, or troll, or Ogre. That's the kind of race that should have male only",2015-11-06T19:50:36.000Z,0
