Total Gross revenue:

I wonder why they stopped using TD's formula... People don't go to see this kind of movie for facts and realism, they go to have fun and watch the impossible stunts with the pretty explosions. When I want to think I pick up a book, when I want to relax, I watch a movie.

Then Universal gave him a green flag to do the script he originally wanted to do (fast and furious), after Tokyo drift was planned out. by the looks of it; it was meant that fast and furious was the original sequel. I think because fast and furious was a hit, Vin got an Idea for the fifth movie and sixth; which would be a mix of both story lines; so it would go: TF&TF, 2f2f, F&F,FF,TD, then the 6th.",2010-12-19T05:48:14.000Z,0

Well incase anyone is confused, this is the chronological order list of the movies below :
part 1- The Fast and the Furious (2001)
part 2- 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)
part 4- Fast & Furious (2009)
part 5- Fast Five (2011)
part 3- The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

So In the chronological order, Han will still be alive in movies 4,5, but die in part 3. And Letty dies in part 4, so shes not in 5 or 3.
At least we still have the Sexy Jordana Brewster :)",2010-12-16T08:06:37.000Z,0
