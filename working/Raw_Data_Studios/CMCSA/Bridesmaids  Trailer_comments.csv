It's not shittier just Americanized, frankly I've watched british television and movies. There is too much realism (think fat old people in corrie and eastenders) compared to youthful hot shows like most of our sitcoms/soaps.  

You Englified The Apprentice , do you see any of us complaining about uglier contestants and smaller budgets ?
