After all they are making many movies of Spiderman characters like Venom, Carnage, Black cat, cindy moon, etc. And Disney probably won't allow Tom Holland to be a part of that so. Spiderman has to appear in those films, it should be Andrew. Andrew was a good Spiderman. It would be Amazing to see him as the character again. can someone start a petition lmao.",2018-10-16T13:28:07.000Z,0

Yes, he did somewhat try and find out about his parents, but not hardly like the trailer portrayed. Personally, I love this movie. I loved it for it's darker tone. I liked how he wasn't so much a superhero, but more of a vigilante. This movie was great, but the trailer made it out to be so much better. Apparently they changed it because the trailer was poorly received by fans, so they moved the finding the truth about his parents to TASM2.  You can tell that those who didn't like the trailer were just upset that the original Spider-man franchise was out of the picture. I loved the original as a kid. However, as I got older it seemed more and more... cheesy. Where this movie is a lot darker and realistic. I wish I could have seen what this movie was originally going to be. It seems like it would have been the best superhero film to date Imo.",2018-08-18T16:28:10.000Z,0

2012-02-05T01:58:08.000Z,-tnxzJ0SSOw,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 3D - Official Trailer,"Despite the second movie not being very good, I can safely say as a spidey fan that this movie is incredibly underrated. Sure it has problems and it has sorta copied the original Raimi films and will never be as good as those, this movie still has a lot to love here. For example the cast is once again great and the romance between Peter and Gwen is FAR better than him and mj (Also at least Gwen actually did something other than just scream) 

Another thing to like here is the action (not visual effects) I love the originals just as much as the other guy, but I will agree that some of the action in the original movies kinda feel like an episode of power rangers. They don't really show how much spidey could move around and how fast ge really is. In this film, we get the best of Spidey's powers with the power of cgi. It may not look as impressive as the originals but it does improve the fight choreography.

This movie (and the second one) will never be as good as the originals but it does have a lot to offer and things we've never seen before in a spider man movie. Yeah sure the writing is flawed and the villain is kinda weak but it shouldn't stop many spidey fans from enjoying this movie with their true fanboyism (as long as they skip the second one)",2017-12-17T14:17:35.000Z,1

Andrew Garfield has a better patrayal of what Spiderman should be. while Tobey Maguire seems to put a more adult and mature version of Spiderman, and more or less, shows a more corny and weird version of Spiderman. yeah, Tobey does, at times, show a the funny and goofy Spiderman, and gives the weird part of Peter Parker like we see in the comics, but it's just the fact that Tobey doesn't accurately show Peter's point of view, but he does give us a good Spiderman interpretation. and the villains are just weirdly formed, and yet, Sam Raime gave them time to develop, while the villains in the new film are rushed and aren't given time to develop. so as a result of these reasons, I chose both, but if I had to choose one it'd be the new Spiderman.",2016-12-03T02:35:00.000Z,2

spiderman had some iconic scenes like upside down kiss , bomb detonation on the face of spidey with his mask burning in slow motion etc . while amazing spiderman had non , it even feels like a video game not like a movie .

Because it was so true to the original comics! 
The web was always something he MADE, not an ability, Gwen was Spidey's first love and what haunts Spidey through many comics, Lizard was a good guy most of the time in the comics- just a little bit of uncontrollable at times, and he was incredibly intelegent and awkwardly quirky.

His spider bite and him being a superhero should not be planned. It was all an accident. I could be wrong, but this is what it seems like they're trying to do. Does anyone else feel the same?

With great power comes great responsibility.<--THAT Feeling. 
It should make you see how Spider-Man changes emotionally/physically in time because of his situations. 

So far to me, the only series that brought that feeling was the 1994 animated series.
Raimi's movies attempted to get that feeling but failed it!

I hope this movie brings it, Garfield is perfect for the role.

They insisted on this because they didn't think Vulture was ""hip enough"" to be the sole villain. I kinda agree with them on that. Compared to the other two villains that had their own movies, Vulture is a bit of a downgrade.
 
I partly blame the people who complainied about SM3 having ""too many villains"" because it looked like Raimi was actually listening to that silly complaint. If it weren't for them he may have considered using another villain.

People bash Tobey for not acting the part or not being funny enough.  The way the scripts were written, he did a good job.  You can't say he was bad when he did what was written.

Actors do have power, but it depends on who they are and who the director is.  Christopher Nolan wouldn't let an actor change his screenplay unless they had a very good idea or reason behind it.  If they disagree about something, he'd try to make them understand.

I liked Raimi's trilogy but for some reason they already feel outdated. The modern world is developing radically so it only makes sense that films do the same. I love anything to do with Spider-Man and I would be pretty annoyed if this turns out to be a huge let down.

The only time anything you say will be valid, is when the movie is released. Until that time be optimistic. There are some things that have me worried about TDKR but for the most part I am positive. Bane is much smaller than Batman for example but to be honest, it is just superficial, I know that substance matters much more than looks. The same goes for the Lizard, as long as the character is done justice what does it matter ? ",2012-03-01T17:13:47.000Z,0

Just like Robert Downey is to Iron Man. To Recast  the director of 2.5B dollar franchise  and its sensational star was crazy.  And Im not even sure if I will give this film a shot.

cons: too soon to reboot, the peter parker I remember from comics and cartoons looked to be more college age.

The problem is the films had the same formula throughout the trilogy. Mary Jane get's kidnapped, Spidey comes to the rescue. Spiderman 2, MJ is kidnapped Spidey comes to the rescue. Spiderman 3, MJ is kidnapped, Spidey comes to the rescue. That does not appear to be the case in this new film, which I feel already makes it fresher.",2012-02-13T21:04:08.000Z,0

Dear Sir, i am a film enthusiast and i'm well aware of great movies being made even today. And i'm also well aware how difficult it can be for a visionary director to find decent distribution, funding and production from film companies, because the general audience tends to share your opinion. As for ""whining"", one day you might learn that youtube comments are for everyone to state their opinion, not only those you happen to agree with.

Why waste you're time posting a comment if you can't stand the look of it?

Spidey 4 was going to have potentially both Vulture and Lizard(even talk of Venom returning), with Lizard being the main villian. That's why Dr Connors was in both Spiderman 2 and 3, in order to set the character up to betray Spiderman and become the Lizard in the 4th film.

His character even appearing in 2 and 3 was supposed to be a Sequel Hook for 4....",2012-02-10T15:43:25.000Z,0

i agree about spidey 3, totally sucked, the writing team had no clue. i'll reserve judgement on this reimagining of the origins until i have seen it, however based on how ke kicked the cops ass, and finally the lizard is the villian, i have medium to high expectations for this movie.

This isn't closer to the comics in regards to the plot, it's closer in that the characters are what they were in the comics. Peter is a scientific mind (he actually invents things), not just a nerd, Gwen is his first love, not some girl he flirts with while dating MJ, Spidey uses one liners to throw off his foes, etc. Also, it doesn't look like Connors is a ""bad guy"" in this, until, as you said, lizard DNA alters him.

They don't call him that, he calls himself that. If you read the comics it's really hit and miss what the public and police thinks of him, and a lot of the times Jameson wins out and people hate Spidey. In recent ASM arcs, Jameson is mayor of new York and even has a huge anti-Spidey police force.

If they had not changed the look of the movie people would be saying ""well it looks exactly the same."" I think the cinematography looks fantastic. It mixes comic book style with a realistic twist. I liked the Sam Raimi films but I think this deserves a chance as well. Unfortunately what I have gathered is some people will not accept change, so instead they bash it.

actually if you look at almost any spider-man comic, Andrew Garfield actually looks almost perfectly like peter parker. Everyone is just used to Tobey being spidey, but Sam raimi's movies (while I own all 3 and love all 3) went WAAAY off track with A LOT of stuff, like organic webshooting, instead of peter making webshooters.

if you're referring to him making web-shooters instead of having the organic web out of wrists thing, look up any kind of origin of spider-man. web-making was never a power he had. in the original comics, peter creates the webshooters to go with the powers he got: strength, speed, sticking to walls, and spider-sense.

Probably with the car thief encounter being the very first scene.

Raimi made colourful summer blockbusters but Marc Webb seems to be taking care and passion in this film. Even as a kid watching the fisrst film it always felt like Tobey Maguire was a guy dressed as Spider-Man. This time? Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man.,2012-02-08T19:37:26.000Z,0

Specifically - almost all of Spiderman's movements were actually performed by stuntmen in harnesses. As opposed to the scenes in the older  trilogy in which all of Spiderman's airborne movements were CGI. 
They've made a real effort to use practical effects instead of faking it. Maybe it doesn't show too well in the trailer   ",2012-02-08T01:06:51.000Z,0

2012-02-05T01:58:08.000Z,-tnxzJ0SSOw,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 3D - Official Trailer,@morolyn You haven't read a single spider-man story have you. The characters personality is what brings light to really dark situations. Batman doesn't make jokes but spidey does. His story is very dark and tragic one but he uses it as a drive to make things better for everyone he can help. The other movies were a debacle. I am still waiting for someone to tell me how its more faithful. Plus Peters parents mysterious life has always had a big impact on his character.

this looks EXACTLY the same as the first 3 spiderman doesn't look any better, the only difference is they made this one darker colored, so you can't see how obvious the CGI is.

Raimis movies were not perfect but they were a lot better than this looks. minus the third film of course.
fans of this movie would call me a troll and anyone who thinks it looks shit a troll because it makes them believe in the end the film will be good. and annnnyone who says it looks fucking shit...oh, they're just a TROLL!

Peter seems a lot more angry & bitter than the one portrayed in Raimi's films, which will be a good thing. I love Raimi's versions, except that they were beginning to get way too campy which was what really killed the original Batman movies. Audiences don't want their super heroes to be campy, they want them realistic (well, as realistic as someone with super powers wearing tights CAN be lol).",2012-02-07T20:49:45.000Z,0

Its primarily about:
1) This is a unnecessary remake, meant only to renew the rights for Spiderman to Columbia Pictures, so Marvel Studios can't buy the rights.
2) Sam Raimi isn't directing.
I want to see what this new director is going to bring, but Sam Raimi was the one who kept the humorous feeling of Spider-man alive even in the drama.

What I didn't like about the original trilogy was that they strayed so much from the comics.  The only thing I really disagree with is that people are associating the actor with the overall quality of the film.  That isn't really fair since they don't write or direct the material.

This is a Sony Pictures production so they don‚Äôt have to follow that half-assed Avengers story with the shitty version of Nick Fury. So this is one of the first Marvel films that is breaking free from the Marvel Universe storyline and going back to something more traditional. Also, it's not targeted towards teeny boppers, which is a win in my book.

2) Web shooters, none of this organic web bullshit
3)They went with the Batman Begins approach and saved a better villan for a sequel (ie. Green Goblin)
4) Instead of an animated Spiderman flipping around and beating up bad guys, it looks like they got an acrobat to do all that stuff for real.

ehm. Spider-Man was always pursued by the cops dude. Way before the Batman movies. Most of the storylines you see here are taken directly from the comics. Also, there was never any mystery surrounding Bruce Waynes parents.

The original trilogy is that one that had way too much angst. This one has a broader range of emotions. Theres a LOT of humor in this movie too, coming from the sarcastic Spidey.",2012-02-07T17:30:56.000Z,0

Also, what can I say, Lizard is truly one of Spider-man's most interesting characters considering the role he plays throughout the series.",2012-02-07T16:25:46.000Z,0

Its not back to the basics.  Unless you are talking about Hollywood exploiting people's money.  Yes, they are doing a reboot.

BUT its done wrong all over.... 
Wrong for doing a reboot to begin with.
Wrong Characters for the parts to second that. (They do not look the part)
And it looks over produced.

Why did they have to reboot? Greed and over eagerness to rush to theatre.

I am NOT happy with the Mary Jane Watson being blonde instead of a red head as she always was. Also this one is a jerk compared to the humble Tobey Maguire.  Probably his best role he has taken on.

Now people use that as an excuse to accept a reboot and think that it's going to better thus looking down at the previous films which is could of dumb when you think about it! ,2012-02-07T12:32:04.000Z,0

and don't act like its a surprise that you get to see the actor as Peter instead of a whole film of nothing but skin tight spandex. If you wanted that I think you are on the wrong website. Anyway the superheroes always have a secret identity. Maybe, just maybe, thats why ALL the films are like that?

You can't say the dialouge is awful when you haven't seen it. The action looks good. If you don't want a live action film, go see Superman returns. This cast looks very similar to the ultmate spiderman comics so the casting isn't awful.

1) It's based alot on the ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" comics, and in that series, Peter's dad worked with Dr Connors. It's also a bit of creative liberties. We have no idea what the story will entail. Maybe Peter was with Dr Connors when he injected himself.

2) The cops are always after Spider-Man in the comics.

3) Like I said earlier, it's based alot of ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" and in that series, he is unmasked SO MUCH. And also, we don't know how the story will go.",2012-02-07T08:39:40.000Z,0
