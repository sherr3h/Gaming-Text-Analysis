2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"I really appreciate these Andrew Garfield spiderman movies because they were very serious and had incredible CGI. The director wasn't afraid to experiment with darker tones, character deaths, and intense action sequences. Homecoming was a joke compared to both these movies and I felt it didn't take itself seriously enough. The CGI was pretty bad and it wasn't entertaining. There weren't any memorable action sequences that I would want to rewatch. I feel like the MCU is too afraid to use darker tones and experiment with new ideas because they want to play it safe with the critics. Overall, I truly enjoyed the Andrew Garfield spiderman films and felt that they were much more serious and action-packed compared to most MCU films, which tend to be a joke.",2019-07-01T16:16:02.000Z,2

I like Peter portrayed as a normal  teen and not incredibly weak and nerdy. In the second movie the studio absolutely wasted Rhino character, he was miscast and written horribly. The same can be said of green goblins transformation and fight scene with Spiderman, entire thing felt rushed. I like the setup for sinister six too bad it was never realized. I think the character he developed would have been a great addition to marvel universe, I   don't understand why the moviemakers wouldn't want a strong version of Spider-Man to join the cast of characters.

Spiderman was awesome in the movie but Peter wasn't, idk about you guys but idgaf about Peter's parents I only care about uncle Ben and aunt may, I wish they didn't spend so much time focusing on him finding his parents because no one cares. Another thing that was disappointing was the supporting characters like Harry Osborn, Norman, Max. I hate that Harry wasn't in the first film so when they introduced him in this movie they try to make you feel like him and Peter have been bff's forever but it didn't work. And finally the villains were terrible, they made the same mistake spiderman 3 made with TOO MANY VILLIANS. Electro wasn't all that bad but his motivations were so stupid, Green goblin looked so bad he looked like he had face herpes and rhino was a fucking joke.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"My idea for the movie would have been that in the beginning, Norman Osborn hires Rhino as the Rhino to retrieve a few, for story purposes plutonium vials for him to create a super weapon that he intends to sell to a foreign buyer. Spider man, having known that Rhino has a mercenary like agenda, stops him and demands him to tell him who is his employer but Rhino refuses to tell and is sent to jail. Meanwhile the board of Oscorp become suspicious of what Norman Osborn is doing and plan to have him removed of the board of directors. Knowing that Spidey would become a threat to him as he recognises the spider DNA enhancements from the genetic spiders, Norman decides to inject himself with a serum and turns into the Goblin. Later Max Dillon falls into a tank of eels and turns into Electro where he heads to time square. During this time the board of directors remove Norman Osborne as CEO of Oscorp which forces Norman to return as the green goblin and kill the board of directors which is reported across New York but not before Spidey defeats Electro and imprisoned him in Ravenscroft. 

With the buyer wanting the super weapon soon, Norman realises that he needs more money to continue so he robs a bank as the green goblin but flees after being defeated by Spidey. Knowing that Spidey is becoming a major problem and that after watching records of Electro in action Norman as the goblin frees him from Ravenscroft and forms an alliance-the same to rhino after freeing him from prison. Norman has finished building the weapon which is a biological bomb that can kill anyone within it's radius and after betraying his unknown buyer, the green goblin decides to use it on New York city while Rhino and Electro hold the entire city hostage to lure Spidey into a trap. Spidey falls for it and is overwhelmed by the three villains but Gwen arrives to help (like in the movie).

 There she and Spidey work together to take down both Electro and Rhino in which electro is grounded and rhino dies. Gwen attempts to stop the bomb from being deployed but is captured by the goblin. The goblin finally lures Spidey to the clock tower and the two fight brutally while Gwen dangles below. Spidey  finally stops the bomb from going off while goblin throws a hail of pumpkin bombs at him.  Spidey slings them back with a web net killing Norman Osborn while Gwen falls down. Since I brutally hate Mary Jane Watson, Spidey saves Gwen from her death. Harry learning that Spidey killed his dad, breaks out Electro where he explains he wants four other guys to help them kill Spidey. The movie ends with Electro saying let's go catch a spider.

Notes:  The plot from the first movie never happened, it is completely different. This is just an idea. Harry was there during the final battle. And the only subplot is Gwen and Peter's relationship. Like I said this how I wanted the movie to go like. Oh yeah in the third one I came up with, Peter dies in Gwen's arms from Harry's sinister six with Aunt May finding out Peter's secret identity as well. this establishes Miles Morales becoming the next Spidey in which it ends with a spider from Harry's Oz formula biting Miles on the hand with him saying ""Oh no""",2015-04-03T16:54:38.000Z,9

Better yet, just check out all the news and articles out there! They are really interesting.

The good news is andrew garfield will be in the next movie, and another good thing they are continuing the franchise because restarting the whole series AGAIN just because it received mostly ""mixed or average"" reviews from critics is a bit of a stretch. And do we really need ¬†a 3rd version of Spidey? I think not. What I REALLY want to know is who's going to be the next villain spidey will be battling with.

How about a movie where Spider-Man, Silver Sable and The Lizard (Curt Connors) team up to save the world against the threat of Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin and Venom (these vilains have also united their forces). It could be a movie like The Avengers: a movie with many heroes, a team movie. Spider-Man would be the acrobatic one, Sable the weapon master, and Lizard would be like The Hulk. Venom could be like a predator, following Spider-Man and attacking him from time to time. Goblin could be a big colossal beast like the Goblin from the Ultimate universe, and Octopus would be a cerebral villain.",2015-01-16T12:27:39.000Z,0

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"In my opinion, if they cut the side story with his parents out and kept the other scenes with harry(to make the second, lesser villain more interesting, which was one of the biggest problems about the movie IMO), then this movie would have been so much better. I think the problem was that they tried to fit so much stuff in there, that there wasn't time to fully flesh out any of it.

I see a few comments saying Garfield is a bad Spiderman/Peter and I completely disagree. I think he is great and this movie being bad was not at all because of him or Emma Stone. In fact, this is probably one of only a few movies where I actually liked the ""love story"".

But yeah, that is what I think. Cool action, a bit depressing, definitely disappointing, yet still has lots of potential for the future.",2015-01-13T14:38:32.000Z,64

What the fuck are you doing I mean Harry killed Gwen and all Peter did was mourn for her I would have beat the fucking piss out of harry and might actually have killed him Dane Dehaan you're going to get it everybody listening I'm putting a $350 million bounty on Dane's head just dead no dead or alive bullshit I'm surprised nobody tried to cut his face off after the premier of the movie you listening Dane?Whoever kills you is going to be filthy fuckin' rich. P.s  I'm only waiting 24 hours any longer than that you don't get a cent anybody who's in leave a reply after I submit this you're going down Dane Dehaan and Marc Webb you're next,2014-11-15T20:15:21.000Z,0
2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Harry in this trailer was way more interesting than the way he was shown in the movie. At least here, his presence and the fact that he's Peter's best friend don't feel shoehorned into the movie just so we can get to the Goblin part. He actually seems more charismatic, mysterious, magnetic and even more of a threat to Spider-Man here - the guy has Peter and Aunt May under surveillance! They had to be under surveillance for a reason but in the movie there's no surveillance and he doesn't even realise Spider-Man and Peter are the same person until he flies onto the scene and sees Gwen, finally putting 2 and 2 together.

This trailer version of Harry is what should have been in the final cut",2014-11-15T01:10:06.000Z,2

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),I just want to make this very clear to all of the uneducated people commenting on this trailer. They are going by the comic book story line. The original spiderman movies did NOT go by the amazing spiderman comic book story line. If you have a problem with them being genuine to the story line ten times more genuine then the original movies then fine. You are still contributing to the movie. You are still watching the movies. The hate you are giving has no effect on the movies at all. I personally love these movies because they are being genuine. First off Spider-Man's first love was supposed to be Gwen how'd they do it in the original spiderman they made it Mary Jane he does not meet her till years after Gwen died. Just an example of how this is genuine to the comic books while the originals where not. So if you are not educated then don't try to act like you are. You have a right to your opinion but don't be ignorant. Thank you.,2014-08-20T08:54:58.000Z,2

Not accuracy, adapting and perfecting their comic books. If it's not a documentary movie or fiction, critics will bash it too.

My hopes for a better Spider-Man movie series have been shattered. I've loved spidey since I was 3 yrs old and seeing this movie made the child in me die a little bit. Yeah, I thought it was that terrible. I fucking hate this movie so much and I'll never get over how much I was let down. I think I almost fell asleep. The trailers showed all the best parts and everything in between was complete shit. You can yell in my face telling me how much you loved this movie but I literally would not care. I am done.

It was directionless, poorly paced, and tried to be everything at once.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"I watched this in the cinema with big expectations since I've watched the trailers a bunch of time. I've also watched the first one and I was severely disappointed with it. But I thought of giving this sequel a chance since the trailers looked awesome. This is the first time in my long years of watching movies that I feel like leaving the cinema while the film was playing. It bored me to death, the film is too cheesy, and it focused too much on Peter and Gwen's relationship. It may be a good flick for chicks, but not to those who seek to see a superhero in action. Rhino, Electro and other villains in the trailers are just a side story. Don't get me wrong, I love Spiderman, and I love all of it's comic book version. But this movie sucks, and if the writers and the director are trying to set apart themselves from Tobey's version, well, they have succeeded in doing just that.. Tobey's Spidey is far better than this Bollywood version of spiderman.¬†
My advice, Do yourself a favor and buy Tobey's Spiderman Trilogy. It's way better than this, believe me. :)¬†",2014-08-10T11:20:14.000Z,0

I thought that Stan lee's cameo was a waste because it had no humor and no real importance in that scene. A little part of me kinda wishes that Marvel could move forward with this franchise and give it the boost that it needs. It seems that even Sony is having to rethink all there previous ideas and that has resulted in the next film getting pushed back to 2018 :-( If they can't fix this then just give-up Sony and give Marvel back spider man!!! that goes for you to 20th century Fox, X-men DOFP was AWESOME!!! but this Fantastic four reboot is a disaster waiting to happen¬†",2014-07-26T16:41:35.000Z,1

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD)," The orginal trilogy was awful with exceptions from spiderman 2 but that movie.still had some really corny moments. The first spiderman was good and i.admit its a classic but it lacked backround info of how he got his powers and his parents. And i thought they did a terrible job on the green goblin. And i dnt understand at the end how he survived getting hit with a bomb???? 

Spiderman 2 was the best out of all.of them. But i didnt like how he lost his powers becuase it got to hard for him and became a weak corny nerd who wouldnt help somone getting robbed because hes.not spiderman anymore! And i thought is was stupid how he got his powers back becuase of mj. I mean rly what about the guy u just let get mugged? 

Spiderman 3 was just terrible they tried to cram so much into it and it was just a mess. I liked how they tried to do venom but they shoulda just focused on him for the whole movie and.not make spiderman a emo guy wearing eye liner. I also didnt like how they got eric forman to play venom. I thought that fezz was just gonna pop outa no where along with the rest of the crew. And making sandman uncle bens real killer was just bad storytelling and a  way just to get another super villian. And there was just too much crying!

The amazing spiderman is the best spiderman movie out of all of them! They showed why peters parents left him with his ant and uncles. And showed how smart he rly was like in the comics such as making his web shooters. They also showed his sense of humor witch also goes back to  the comics witch in the sam ramis triogy really lacked of and when they did show it ir was really corny! They showed how his powers worked for him and had a pretty good backround on the lizard and what he was trying to do.

The amazing spiderman 2 was a good sequel but lacked alot.of backround info! It felt rushed and lacked alot lf backround info Such as harry coming out of no where and then all of a sudden turning into the green goblin in the last 15 min of the movie along with rhino witch they failed to do by making him a robot and having 2 min.of screen time! I also think that electo was good but his reasonings for turning bad was just poorly writtin and i felt like they were trying to hard to make max a nerd and a nobody! The fighting was amazing but i also think they killed gwen off to early and didnt rly explain wat had happend or what happend after she had died the next scene was her funeral.",2014-07-07T13:11:34.000Z,0

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"I like the fact that this movie is good, However, It did feel rushed and at times it did have cheesy love scene's and whatnot. Why is Everyone still bitching about ""Tobey is the best spider man."" Hell to the fuck no, I think Andrew did a Way better job playing spider-man, When did Spidey ""fans"" known Spider-man to be a very serious character? (comics, Tv show, etc.) Never, He always had something wise cracking to say in the comics and TV shows. I like the fact how Dedicated to science in this one than the other predecessors, He wrote science equations on his skateboard in the first Amazing spider-man. He actually Built his web shooters, thus showing how Smart a average kid from Forrest hill, new york really is. And the fact that people complain about how much of a nerd He is not in the movie, This man BUILT web shooters and found a cure for Dr. Connors amputated arm, He resembles the more modern Peter Parker from the 616/Ultimate universes. Tobey fans claimed to represent the ""Classic peter Parker."" NEWSFLASH: Classic peter Parker (Even outside his witty spider-man persona) was still a joking and happy kind of guy. They tried to modernize peter Parker instead of copying from the predecessor, why? They used something called Source material, And actually put source material in the movie. So, I can complain less about the movie.

PS: Most likely the scene's cut out of the movie are going to be on the directors cut of Amazing spider man 2, So really who's complaining, I know I'm not.",2014-06-24T17:28:00.000Z,1

Alright, it was perhaps slightly longer than it needed to be, they might have trimmed it down slightly, but it was so well paced that it didn't feel as long as it was. But I have to admit I expected better acting from Dane DeHaan, for me he didn't deliver to his usually level. Jamie Foxx was passable, he did play maxx Dillion well, made you empathise with him for the sad suck that he was. But¬†Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and¬†Sally Field were amazing and portrayed their rolls with great emotion, especially Andrew Garfield, he makes a great spiderman. The visuals were also great, New York looked amazing plus the web swinging and movement of spiderman was the best I've seen on the big screen yet. Plus spiderman himself was, wise cracking, mouth running and genuinely funny.

Bad movie, it's a superhero movie made for teen girls.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"I enjoyed the movie, really really ENJOYED IT. Good thing I only watched one trailer not the other ones with too many scenes shown. Before I watched it I have read some forum saying there were too many things going on, or too many villains, so I expected it all already so for me its all ok. Its not confusing. And about Harry, its understandable there wasnt enough time for their friendship scenes, the movie doesnt have to repeat everything again what we already saw in the past Spiderman franchise. It is boring if every detail has to be explained. When you watch this movie just use your logic and be understandable. Dont complain too much like you know how to direct a movie or write scripts. Compared to other heavy graphics movies, this movie was much much better. Definitely one of my favorite superhero movies of all time, just second or third to The Dark Knight. And of course, Emma Stone's charisma has a lot of impact in the movie as well.",2014-05-15T06:02:42.000Z,1

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"So as people know there is suppose to be ""Easter Eggs"" in the movie giving clue of what is yet to come in future spiderman installments. There are parts which will seem very easy to spot such as how the trailer and movie are different in reference to Symbiote in the vault being in the trailer but not the movie, also having Dr. Octopus suit and vulture suit in the oscorp vault. Rhino at the end of the movie obviously. ¬†

The main one i am questioning is NIGHT THRASHER dont know if anyone has picked up on this clue in the movie but watch when Peter is speaking to Aunt May look at the t-shirt he is wearing it has ""THRASHER"" written across it with a simplistic drawing.¬†

Love to know peoples thoughts on this and whether it could be something to take note of or just a coincidence.

Atlast when emma stone falls down her head doesnt hit any thing and soon the spiderman webs her and saves her from hitting on floor. Therefore she hangs there and spiderman reaches down from top of clock tower (inside).. I thought she was faited but she died ? How come she die just in a fall ? It didnt even hurt her but she had dream while falling down.. I am totally disappointed in this sence. She shouldnt have died that fast. Atleast it should be like that clock tower some metal hits her head and bla bla. But she hanged safely and suddenly blood bleed and she died. Atleast he must hv spoke something be4 dead. This movie is awesome.. that sence she dying was really a crap.. ending was pretty good wid that little kid.

It explains a hell a lot more about the main character and deplicts him better than the orignal triology. 
Also how are there too many villains? 
How was the script sloppy? 
The main villian was obvious,  ELECTRO!!!
The other villians barely had screen time, if anything the other villians were just a foil. 
I feel like people got to watch the orignal spiderman again and see if they can still say this movie sucked. 
Honestly watching the other spiderman now, all I can say it is cheesy as fuck compared to this new reboot.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"This movie felt so Hollywood it really bums me out. In a few years this film will be a faded memory because all this movie does is boast great graphics which will be 1-upped very quickly. The only parts of the film that feel authentic are parts between Gwen and Peter and that's likely only because Andrew and Emma are actually in a relationship outside of the film. The emotional scene where something terrible happens felt like the only part that really had effort put into it and the whole movie truly feels like it was just made to set up the next films. And if that continues, then each film will just be made to set up the next one. When will time be taken to actually make a good movie with a story that is well thought-out? Instead of weird script directions like Harry Osborn ""needing"" Electro to break back into the same building he was just in five minutes before that and could've grabbed the serum on his way out? And how Electro was treated, he had such a sad backstory and what the film ends up doing with his character just felt wrong. Plus that crazy ""doctor"" that treats Electro was so awkwardly over the top and not in a good way. I really wouldn't mind this film's flaws if it didn't feel like it was just a mess of footage thrown at the screen with animators working their tails off (and probably not getting paid enough) to make the fight scenes look good. But if people eat this movie up and think it's ""epic"" then I guess Hollywood will keep trying to make things easier for themselves because they know people will just eat it up because of how good something looks rather than how good something actually is. Maybe I'm just too old for these types of films since I'm 23 and grew up with the Sam Raimi films that had special effects as an effect rather than the focus of the films (the first two of Sam Raimi's anyway). This Amazing Spider Man movie had two or three good scenes but this just felt like a movie made fast and sold to the masses for how it looks and all the hype they've spent millions creating through advertising. Sony wins in the end I guess. I'll just go back into my hermit cave and watch Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 again.",2014-05-08T22:50:03.000Z,1

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"It still amazes me that this movie got mixed reviews as it has, just shows how harder it is to please people now.

I think many people also went in with the mindset it was supposed to be the same edgy sequel the first one was, trying so hard to be dark and edgy (thanks Nolan). A criminal thing many superhero movies are doing of late and I'm glad the sequel felt like a Spider-Man movie again, I felt like I was finally watching a movie with the comic book wall crawler finally done justice. Making it colourful, delightful and fun over anything else. It felt like a proper family superhero film again, and that's why I loved it. It was being what Spider-Man is supposed to be, I could imagine kids watching this movie thinking the hero himself was well... amazing. It really shown how great of a role model Spider-Man is without constantly throwing it in your face like Man of Steel did.

I'm just relieved it wasn't as dark as the first one primarily though. But I'm genuinely surprised it's got mixed reviews. Whether it's from the amount of villains (which isn't even half as bad as it was in Spider-Man 3) or it simply not starring Tobey Maguire (which actual fans of the comics wouldn't give a shit about anyway since he was completely out of character to how Peter's character evolved) I still find people overbloating and overcriticising. I could imagine if this film came out 5 years or so earlier, it would've gotten critically acclaimed, people are just harder to please now and complain about absolutely everything.Ôªø",2014-05-07T19:46:48.000Z,20

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"I didn't like the movie, it was too boring, it's like two action scenes with more than an hour between them, the rest it's many not so engaging plot lines, and twilight-level cheesy Peter/Gwen scenes

It has some good stuff, I liked the way the villans looked and the action scenes were ok (too sad there's probably no more than 15 minutes of action in the movie)

I also liked how they adapted Gwen's death from the comic¬†

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"A few things i didn't like...
- I thought Max Dillon was a little cheesy and campy. I didn't buy Jamie Foxx playing the nerd.
- I thought Electro was cool but it would have been better if he was still a physical person rather than just being electricity particles. If he still had a physical body it would have been a more believable/convincing death.¬†
- The people of NYC standing around barricades (almost looking like an arena) and cheering on a fight when a mechanical rhino is firing machine guns
- I loved Harry but how he found the goblin suit, was able to be a master of how to use the glider and all of the suit's gadgets, maniacal laugh, etc. Just the overall transition into becoming the green goblin happened very very fast.
- They excluded what looked like a lot of cool scenes/lines from the trailers
- Rhino's accent. I didn't really even mind too much but why cast someone like Paul Giamatti to have him do a bad Russian accent?¬†

All that aside, for me all the positives far outweigh the negatives and i really enjoyed this movie. I'm going to have to watch it over again but it's probably my favorite Spider-Man movie thus far. I just really like this new incarnation",2014-05-06T22:54:59.000Z,0

I mean if u read the comics this movie was pretty damn good it has that Gwen and Peter love story to it and it connects with Peter parkers problems like in the comics but If u are a Sam Rami fan or a Action Movie fan than this movie is not for you! But if you read the comics this movie does Justice. If you read the comics and didn't like this movie than that's your problem because it was¬†pretty good.,2014-05-05T16:14:16.000Z,12

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"I think the problem with modern comic book fans is that they expect the adaptions of there favorite comics to be flawless and 100% accurate to THEIR favorite individual story arcs. This Spiderman is an amalgamation of the original spiderman and the ultimate spiderman comics published back in 2001-02. Its not going to have the feel of the original 60s comics. Also I feel that some fans go into a movie expecting it to entertain them like the comic book would, and when it doesn't do so because watching a movie is a completely different experience than reading a comic book, they immediately pan it. Don't get me wrong, i am a huge comic book nerd and an even bigger fan of Spiderman. Its just when i go see movies like this, i don't judge it on if it is a good adaptation or comic book movie, i judge it based on its quality as a movie, period. If it entertains me and keeps me engaged, then its a good movie in my opinion. For example, i loved the first Amazing Spiderman film because it was a great summer MOVIE. The new Spiderman/Peter Parker (The Andrew Garfield one) made me laugh genuinely and he was entertaining, while as Toby Maguire (please correct me if i spelled it wrong), although he gave an excellent performance that in a lot of ways rivals Andrews, he did not entertain me as much as Andrew. Humor has been an essential part of the Spiderman mythos since the begining, and Garfield's portrayal of Spiderman embodied that more. My whole point in all of this is to say that moviegoers shouldn't judge a comic book movie to its print counter part. Its an unfair comparison and in my opinion at least , not a fair way to judge a movie like this. Of course, if you want to critic a movie like that, thats completely fine.

Needless to say, i do plan on seeing this movie, probably on monday. ",2014-05-03T21:02:37.000Z,1

In my opinion, it had a few too many subplots that could have been condensed to leave more room in the movie for the more important things. Also, the soundtrack could have been better. That's why the original trilogy was great: the music was epic. ASM2 had some epic music in there, but the contemporary songs like Steve Aoki's Pursuit of Happiness and that Phillip Phillips song didn't really fit too well in there. Based on the trailer, we were all led to believe that all three of these villains were going to gang up on Spider-man, when in reality, it was one after the other and they could have done without The Rhino (at least until the next movie)¬†",2014-05-03T20:27:04.000Z,5

Sure they spend a good percent of the movie on the topic of Peter's parents. Why? Because the movie needs something other than Spider-Man running around NY, jumping from buildings, flinging webs at people. ",2014-05-03T17:16:32.000Z,0

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Horrible movie. Spoilers below, but this is my opinion: the logic behind the movie was poorly thought out, and this is my reasoning as to why the writing and movie was horrible, and there was no thought behind the characters except Electro. Dialogue was poor, too much Gwen and Peter, not enough fight scenes (they lasted about probably 20 minutes total for all scenes for a 2.5hr movie), and character development sucked.

Plot was based too much on the romance between Gwen and Peter Parker. Barely any fight scenes, no character development of Harry Osborn or Rhino. The Green Goblin is not supposed to look like a fucking GOBLIN!?!? Harry turned into a Goblin from taking the Spider Venom? How the hell does that make sense?! GREEN GOBLIN IS NOT AN ACTUAL LOOKING GOBLIN....The Green Goblin is a character who has enhanced powers from taking the ""Goblin Formula"", just like old Spiderman movie (with Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe), and he wears a MASK people?!!?!? Also Harry Osborn in this movie was a BIG GIGANTIC BABY, and in my opinion a wimp and gave up his manhood when he screams 'HELP ME! HELP ME! *CRIES HYSTERICALLY* I'M DYING, SAVE ME!!!!"" Then oh, he takes the venom, and finds the glider of the Green Goblin and then all of a sudden magically becomes the Green Goblin?!?! This was completely stupid, and why the hell does Oscorp own all of the machinery for Doc Oc, Rhino and Eagle...Harry Osborn yet alone Norman Osborn were not mob bosses in the comics, and they did not create those characters/villains. Oh and why all of a sudden Harry's 'GOBLIN' features all of a sudden disappear out of nowhere and he says 'they come and go' and there's no explanation whatsoever about this. They didn't even really explain what kind of hereditary disease him and his father had that was making them die.¬†

The whole story and writing of this movie was complete and utter disappointment, I've never been so let down from a movie. The only thing I give to them is that Electro was good, but there should've been more fight scenes with him, and CGI was amazing. Other than that, I think the movie budget was completely spent on CGI rather than the writing development and the logic behind the character development. Next movie only keep it to one Villain not 3!!!!!! Putting 3 villains made the movie worse.",2014-05-03T07:48:09.000Z,0

I have heard all of the, ""Andrew is more like the comics than Toby,"" but Raimi is simply a better director than Webb. Columbia pushed Raimi into making Spiderman 3 into what they wanted, not what Raimi wanted. Raimi did want more money, but come on...the direction he was wanting to go would have been massive for Columbia. They messed up and now the webslinger has most likely had his best days on the big screen. If you don't agree...you're entitled to your opinion, but I don't know...I just can't get into these films.

Plus, Emma fucking stone...come on now. She nails this movie. It's a shame Gwen died (I cried) but the scene was super emotional, and perfect and just...really heart breaking, how it was played out.

Even Harry, for all his preppy rich boy whiny bullshit just wanted to live. I mean, you have a horrible disease, a horrible father and horrible co-workers, you kinda get a little pissed off when a person who could help you doesn't.",2014-05-01T01:51:27.000Z,1

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Every freaking time I hear some guy talk about how the Spiderman movie's ruined forever because Electro's black, I just wanna scream at them to stop bitching. It's annoying and insulting. Unless the story depends on the race of the characters, and race is a vital plot point, then don't get angry about it. Plus, when these guys get called racists and try to defend their arguments, their defenses are just so contradictory. They claim it's not about race, but every argument involves race, otherwise there'd be no arguments. I mean really, listen to this.

""It's not about race"" = ""It's about not changing the characters' race""¬†

""You may as well change everything then!"" = ""A character's race getting changed upsets the entire balance of the Marvel Universe.""

""This ruins the lore"" = ""Changing a character's race makes the story untellable.""

""It's unrealistic"" = ""Black superheroes or villains is unrealistic""

""You might as well remake 'Roots' and have all the slaves be White"" = ""Reality and comic books are equally real""

The reason why superheroes all started out white was because they were made during a time when nobody would make out black people to be heroes. But I guess that this proves something else. The comic book industry has actually outgrown the racist nerds who nitpick on things that have no meaning to the story itself.",2014-04-29T03:30:18.000Z,0

In this...its just boring & they should really ease off on the slow motion <.< over used buddy, just slow down the dosage. Rhino doesnt even show up till the last 2 mins of the ending....(and looks utter crap) as for the other villains? Green goblin jr a mere 3-5 mins on screen no joke. Electro? Less then 20 for sure. The rest of the movie is set around Peter (not much of his alter ego spidey) & Gwen. The whole series is as if they are setting up for something big like the Avengers but unlike the Avengers release incomplete movies with stupid plot twists. CGI might be better then tbh most movies out there but that alone can't save the franchise. Ps. Electric eels? Lol really?  ",2014-04-25T09:22:39.000Z,0

First off they completely wasted Electro... they made him extremely cliche and cheesy, and the sympathy they were hoping for didnt work. The writing was awful, again it was cliche and cheesy and just didnt fit with the film. Green Goblin was executed awfully; Dahn performed brilliant as Osbourne but once he went full Goblin... he just seemed like a cliche'd disney villian that was rather rapey (the smile, lip licking and laugh). Also Rhino is only in the film for about 5 minutes, and ""again"" he is cheesy and act's like an Arnold Schwarzenegger villian. And most of all there is no real presence of a villian in this film... electro has two scenes where he's actually being ""bad"" and Goblin appears in it for around again 5 minutes. This film was awfully directed and the music was even worse for the majority of the film. 4/10. Stream the film online for free if youre that desperate to watch it.",2014-04-24T20:49:35.000Z,0

The plot was a bit jumbled (could've done without the developing Sinister Six plot point, just feels like a cash grab). It's improved upon the first TASM in every. single. way. 'Almost' better than Spiderman 2 (this film definitely has the best action of any Spiderman film to date, though). The only way it's inferior to Spiderman 2 is:¬†
1. Spiderman 2 had a more concise plotline.¬†
2. Music in this film, while a lot better than the first TASM, was still not as good as the old trilogy.
3. Cinematography in this film greatly improved over the first TASM, but still slightly inferior to Raimi's directing (though this one is up for debate).",2014-04-24T03:37:30.000Z,8

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"This movie was a mixture of good and bad.
Good:
The action was timed perfectly. It didn't go overboard nor did we not see enough awesomeness.
The Character development of Peter was interesting.
The humor was incorporated well.
Electro was a great Villain.
Acting is enjoyable.
Special effects and cinematography are brilliant.

Bad: (May contain spoilers)
Harry Osbourn's transformation into becoming a Villain felt rushed. He should have been in the first film to establish his friendship with Peter. The movie just introduced us to Harry and then 3/4 in he discovers Peter's secret and then wants to kill him for not getting Peter's blood to cure himself etc.
The Rhino shouldn't have been advertised because i'm sure most of us wanted more than a teaser at the end. Once again, his entrance felt rushed and I would have liked a small backstory for the person controlling the Machine.
The plot behind Peter's father could have been explained in the first film to allow more time for action.
The constant reminders of the film telling us that Peter and Gwen shouldn't be together because it puts her in danger even though they keep ignoring that kinda gives away her fate....

I give the movie 78/100
- Worth watching if you have liked any Super hero movies or past Spider-Man movies.
- Fans of Spider-Man in general should enjoy this.",2014-04-22T18:17:53.000Z,0

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"I just saw the movie and let me tell you as a hardcore marvel fan it's quite awesome! Just found 2 unforgivable mistakes:

1.-Gwen cuts the f'ing steel strong web spider with her hands when spider man attached her to the police car!!! WTF?! They even show later spider man using his web to redirect a huge water pipe! That shit is strong as fuck!!!

2.-The f'ing spider web is still in the kids project at the end!!! WTFFFFFFFFF!!! Spider man's spider web only lasts a few hours at most! If not the hole f'ing city would be filled with spider web in every building!

And to finish I will say the jokes were plain stupid! They didn't portrait at all the charisma of spidey while figthing. The jokes were forced and lame.

Other than that it's an awesome movie, great music (there's a scene were Gwen and Peter get into a closet and they kiss but it's kind of odd because there's no music), special effects were f'ing cool and the 3D was spot on. Also the Gwen scene at the end was marvelous (although it would have been better if they did the spider web to be attached to her leg and not to her belly like in the original comic) I give it a 9 out of 10.",2014-04-20T10:28:22.000Z,3

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"This film was actually very good, I was expecting, with 3 villains, that it would seem rushed and another spiderman 3 disappointment. However "" SPOILERS "" I really liked Electro and his story and with Green Goblin, I know their wasn't much of him but he is going to be in the next one for sure so character development was not as crucial as Electro. Rhino, on the other hand, disappointed me, but that was what I was expecting anyway. The CGI used when the man is in the suit made me cringe a bit and his voice got on my nerves. Overall this film was very good, I really liked Peter and Gwen and their awkward and romantic situations, especially in Oscorp with the ""cliche hiding place"" and the coffee incident. I will give this film a 8/10. ¬†¬†",2014-04-19T16:25:54.000Z,2

The 3D is really Impressive! One of the best i have seen.
What really disappoints is how the whole movie is structured. 75% Talking 25% Action. It wouldnt be that bad if the action scenes are more spectacular but they are not. Some things could be more well developed ( Goblins Transformation ) and how Electro broke bad. If you're a Spiderman Fan its worth the buck.

AND WHY THE FUCK IS RHINO IN THE MOVIE LIKE 20 Sec!! AND WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT POST CREDIT SCENE! I Was in a Spider man movie and i hoped to see Venom or Sinister Six but no XMEN. The whole time i was like why???? WHY?? Seriously Sony you fucked up with the Trailers and post credit scene.",2014-04-18T09:25:09.000Z,0

If you saw all the trailers,...you have technically seen all the exciting moments. In MY OPINION, Dean Dehaan stole the show and also the chemistry btw Parker and Gwen was really outstanding. Sorry Spidey but you hardly scratched the surface of Captain America: winter soldier. On a bright side, the 3D effects were pretty...amazing!! (no pun intended).

Oh and by the way, there are no end of credits Easter eggs so don't bother wasting time sitting through the entire end credits rather you are treated to a 2 minute never seen clip of the movie X-men: Days of future past in mid-end credits(and damn it looked promising!)¬†

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Raimi fan boys let's get this straight. The most popular complaint is that The Amazing Spider-man is dark. The amazing spider-man was dark because you all forget Peter suffers from depression. He's a lonely guy all he has are his aunt, uncle, and if you include Harry who treats him as an old best friend but pays little attention to him.
After he meets Gwen everything changes. He's not depressed anymore he feels alive and set on living through his uncles words ""With great power comes great responsibility"".
Webb nailed the first one with the little details and the backstory on his past. Making me eager to watch how great the second will be.
Raimi is a good director I'm not bashing him but he viewed Spider-man as more of an opera if that makes any sense. The biggest mistake was casting Tobey (Yes I said it start unliking this but let's be honest) I speak for many people when I say I never saw him as Spider-man. He was a bland weenie of a character.
I never saw that as a 12 yr old boy but seeing the films now they bore the crap out of me. And I just shake my head at every ""joke"" that comes out of Tobey's mouth. To sum it up Raimi didn't make a Spider-man movie but a Raimi movie with Spider-man in it.
I'm more than happy with this reboot.
I welcome all the Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield hating ignorant people to write your hateful comments below. I will gladly ignore your ignorance.

- why everything is so terribly made with CGI? the CGI scenes in the REAL saga didnt look horrible. only in the first one where peter swings around with mary jane, but that moment had no action. now, peter's dodging bullets on slow motion? thats fucking stupid! why didnt he use that in the first amazing spiderman one? also, the action scenes in the amazing spiderman were garbage.
- why is Harry a gay ass emo dude? what was wrong with making him look like a normal person? what kind of company allows those haircuts for their employees?

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"To all the people who do not like the new 'The Amazing Spider-Man' films... Tobey is gone, Classic Spidey is gone,¬†Sam Raimi and all of the old cast and crew are GONE! Listen i understand that some people do not like 'change' or just cannot handle it, when i first heard about these new 'The Amazing Spider-Man' films i was pissed, and i immediately told myself that the new cast and crew were gonna suck and that the films were gonna suck and i am assume you did also.
I watched the first film and found it great to be honest and i also loved it. As much as i liked the Spiderman Trilogy 'The Amazing Spider-Man' in my mind just is so much better than Spiderman 1 and 3 (not 2 ofc). I realized this after i watched the new film with directors commentary and had interesting things pointed out to me. I am a guy who just loves realism (especially when it is a super hero film) the way Spiderman swings in the new films are a lot more realistic, the fact that he has web-shooters is awesome for me (it always bugged me in the trilogy films).
I also like how Marc Webb is focusing more on a realistic swing style, example instead of just effortlessly swinging 'left' and 'right', Spidey may shoot a web on the top of a building and almost run along it making his way up and then excelling to jump and free-fall just to do the same to the parallel building. Marc Webb also mentioned wanting to just have a moment of 'original to the comic books and spider-man trilogy' style swinging, but he wanted it to be realistic, that was why the crane scene was in the last film.
Also i find the soundtrack a lot more suiting and entertaining for this film, although i miss those awesome 2-4 minute kinda like 'what happened in the last film summary's' before the new film began from the 'Spiderman Trilogy'. But i have a problem with how Peter Parker is presented in the new films, 'A' he is kinda good looking so i do not understand how he is an outcast in high-school and he, to me looks like the kinda guy who would just fit right into a group of popular kids, 'B' he should of been wearing glasses right of the bat and not contacts and there should of been a bit more to do with Peter's Photography hobbies and not 'Skateboarding' -_- So i think Tobey did a heck of a lot of a better job with a believable Peter character.
Although on a whole the new story/plot has to be the only thing that makes me want to watch 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' as it is more¬†intriguing than the story in the 'trilogy films' and focuses a lot more on Peter's Parents and what happened to them and more orientated on Oscorp. I want to see a much more interesting plot in the new film, more depth into Oscorp and it secrets, a better orientation with the villains as we know there are 2 and 1 let's say sub villain (i don't want another Spiderman 3, 24+ minutes of venom srsly!).
I want to see Parker working for the Daily Bugle in this film and i want to see more of 'his' life and what he does, i want to see a bit more of a follow up to Uncle Ben's Death and His Parents.
Also i just want to see Spidey with the avengers SONY! So to all the haters out there i advise you just give this film a chance, This film feels like it can only just get better at the moment and i think it is almost shaping up to be one of the best Spidey films yet (IN MY OPINION!).¬†",2014-03-04T17:44:09.000Z,2

In my opinion, this latest Spiderman franchise does a much better job of capturing the feel of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's creation from the 60's. Whoever cast this Peter Parker did an awesome job when they selected Andrew. He reminds me so much of the Peter from the 60's comic book, while still being relevant to 2014. Andrew Garfield, you nailed it. So did Emma for that matter. ¬†And this 2nd installment looks even better - ¬†I look forward to it!¬†",2014-02-06T02:26:39.000Z,0

Just like Woody Allen uses the Manhattan skyline as an ode to pathogenic humor, Stan Lee in a cardinal, template-like fashion used the likes of Manhattan, Queens and the good hot mustard - which Sam Raimi staged in full-blown Broadway style steeped in pulsating, tangible culture clash.¬†

While Mark Webb is certainly entitled to his own rhetoric, vision and error in judgment - this still doesn't feel quite accessible. Nonetheless, I enjoyed Garfield's rendition of Peter Parker in the previous installment and I think Emma Stone is just to die for. Dane DeHaan looks intriguing, too.¬†",2014-02-03T19:33:09.000Z,0

Too many bad guys! Remember in the 3rd movie, they had Harry's Green Goblin, Sandman, and Venom. All of them could have been movies in and of themselves but instead we get short stints with each one. I mean we only got like 5 minutes with Venom. The coolest bad guy in Spiderman and we only got 5 FREAKING MINUTES. Now they are making this one and look what we got. Rhino, Electro, and Green Goblin.

Better Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), better villains (The first green goblin was actually Norman and not Harry), Dr. Octopus, Venom (epic) Sandman, and New Goblin... I hate how the goblin on The Amazing Spiderman 2 looks like David Bowie, that isn't the goblin we're used to.. and really, I'm not racist, but on Daredevil movie Kingpin was black, and in the comics he's white, now they're doing the same with Electro, WTF??? And Rhyno looks like a maniac transformer -.- This Spiderman suit is almost an exact copy of Sam Raimi's one, but with little color changes and Ultimate Spiderman's eyes..and really all villains are from Oscorp? and dr.Octopus claws and vulture wings are already made???? This movie will suck I think.. Sam Raimi's version was waaaaay better - And BRING BACK Mary Jane guys... They're basing this movie on ULTIMATE spider man, but the movie it's called THE AMAZING spiderman it doesn't makes sense..Also judging by the trailer the electro battle with spiderman looks almost the same as the one on the Ultimate Spiderman videogame.. and even the spiderman eyes from the movie looks like the Ultimate ones..And James Franco played a much better Harry Osborn.The new one looks like he's EMO... THIS is not spiderman from my childhood.. BTW the ULTIMATE spiderman comics are cool, but not as cool as THE AMAZING spiderman ones..

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Ok everyone..I think I have figured out how the movie is gona play out..Here it is:¬†

First Half of Film might be like this:
¬†Movie may start with Spidey chasing Rhino in the film to showcase how he has perfected his superpowers..saves Max Dillon on the way..¬†He graduates with Gwen..and still is with her despite his promise to Captain Stacy...¬†He visits Captain Stacy's grave or it could be Uncle Ben's grave to reflect on his responsibility/promise....¬†We see Max dillon being treated like a loser....
Spiderman probably encounters Rhino's threat again..this time around with his mechanical suit...Peter reunites with his old friend Harry osborn...Gets to learn some truth about his father Richard Parker through Oscorp...The reason why Peter maybe under surveillance by Oscorp could be because he is Richard Parker's son or they need his blood to cure Osborn's illness..Harry talks to a dying Norman Osborn about peter etc..Not sure how harry acquires a scar on his left cheekbone..
Peter eventually discovers a secret underground station in the subway as shown in the trailers...realises what Oscorp is going to do with Richard parker's research...I think the above scene could happen either in the middle or towards the end..
¬†
Middle of the film: I think this is where shit turns real..

Max Dillon gets into a freaky accident which renders him superhuman with electric powers..Times Square sequence starts...Spidey neutralises him...Electro probably gets taken by Oscorp and is held captive or maybe temporarily held there...This is probably where Harry actually meets him and negotiates with him to bring Peter's blood to cure Norman Osborn...Electro Escapes and probably is given the suit by Oscorp itself..Harry eventually takes the serum and tries on himself..which results in his mutation to green goblin..

Towards the End of the film: ¬†And now guys..people might ask whether Gwen dies in the movie...I personally think Gwen does not die in the movie...Here is why...the following clue might seem simple but it tells alot.. Observe the scene where Peter fires a web at Gwen's hand and makes a funny quip at her....Look particularly his suit and the condition they are...and compare it to the sequence in the trailer where he dodges the continuos attacks from Electro at the power-plant like place..and when he fights Harry Osborn....His suit actually has differences..His suit looks more damaged when he fights with Electro...Which means that the scene where peter fires a web to her hand, fighting Harry.. might possibly come before Spidey's suit damaged showdown with Electro...And secondly, Gwen's clothes seem to suggest that the scene particularly happens either before/after the Green Goblin fight...Also alot of people assume that the bit where Spiderman lands on a scaffolding and fires a web down with the gears and stuff...they think that it is the moment where he saves Gwen...I think this is wrong!...He maybe actually saving Harry Osborn..who probably gets knocked off from his glider and falls to his death..He may save Harry and send him to Ravencroft...This means that his showdown with electro at the powerplant place is the true climax of the film..this also serves to make Electro the main villain..And I think Gwen ¬†goes to London towards the end of the film..which will probably result in Peter meeting Mary Jane.. And this could probably mean that Gwen dies in the third film..

I could be wrong on this..but all other theories are welcomed..",2014-01-15T15:29:46.000Z,2

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),Everyone Harry is not the Green Goblin it's Norman I bet there is a twist in the story showing Norman becoming The Green Goblin!! Harry is somehow still a Goblin ( Can't remember which )!! I don't think Marc is going to change the franchise much because in the original spiderman The lizard was the first villain and spiderman helped made him!! Of course there has been a twist making electro second but Marc I atleast don't think is changing the franchise like the director of the old spiderman movies did!!!!

If you want to compare, don't compare the one film from last year to the entire trilogy, only the first from both sides.

Spider-Man 1 (2002) has NOT aged well, for anyone who says it holds better than TASM I just think they're lying, I don't see anything in it that makes me think it's a better film. But it is just my opinion.
Well.... maybe aside from the fact it had the Green Goblin (my favourite comic book villain ever) and J. Jonah Jameson who was done BRILLIANTLY by JK Simmons. But they're the only redeeming factors from a movie that has aged poorly.
Spider-Man 2 however, is still awesome. TASM 2 really is going to have a tough time topping that one, not sure it'll be able to but I'm open for it to try. And I'll enjoy it either way since I liked the last one.",2014-01-06T08:17:18.000Z,3

I have a reason to believe that Harry will die and Rhino will be jailed, so that'll leave one empty door because I'm thinking Rhino's suit is in one of them before he gets it. Two doors already have Doc Ock and Vulture, so that was three confirmed doors. Three more doors. Who could they be? Very doubtfully Electro because he's not really wearing a costume. Mysterio's costume definitely has to be one since he is a Sinister Six member. Definitely not Sandman. He doesn't wear a costume. Definitely not Kraven either for the same reason. It's a different team of villains behind those doors. Scorpion could be the other costume and maybe Shocker's gauntlet guns",2014-01-05T19:08:25.000Z,0

Because if Spider Man joins the Avengers, Wolverine would have to join too. Plus, this is only the second sequel. Spider Man needs to battle many of his own villains first. Think of it this way. Spider Man faces so many villains first. They all get locked up at Ryker Prison. Have you read the Ultimate Avenger comic book? I have it actually, but I'm not a big fan of comic books. Sentry gets his own movie and at the end, he gets locked up for murder. Carnage is in prison as well. Electro comes along and breaks out all the villains. Then allow the Avengers tie up with Spider Man as they fight off the villains at the prison. They ask Sentry to help and he takes out Carnage just like in the comic book for a movie.

I doubt Venom would be behind any of the doors. The original Sinister 6 had Sandman and Kraven the hunter involved, but for some reason, I doubt either of them would be behind the doors and I'm pretty sure it would be just costumes behind all the doors. I'm routing for Shocker's costume to be another one, even though he wasn't a member of the Sinister Six. As a matter of fact, Rhino wasn't either. Maybe his costume was behind one door before he got into it. I'm guessing the other villains happen to work for Oscorp at this time. They created the costumes and stored them behind each of the doors, so they will later become the villains and fight Spider Man. Hell, I'll be even happier if one costume was Scorpions.

I'm pretty Sony¬†realized their mistakes with Spiderman 3.¬†The movie¬†didn't do well was because 1. They killed off most of the villians at the end (Giving Venom only 10 minutes) and 2. The combinations of villians were terrible and had nothing to do with each other in the same story. Were in this story they have something in common. Being a part of OSCORP. And guys it doesn't matter if Rhino or Goblin don't have a big part of the film. They WILL NOT be killed off and will for sure return in another film.

Jonah Jameson was always surprised how Peter took great photos of Spiderman in Raimi's franchise, so let's see Jameson hire Mac Gargan A.K.A Scorpion.

His suit was suppose to rememberable and iconic, something kids would love on tv. He even had web cape. Then uncle ben dies and he becomes the webhead we all know and love.

Gwen Stacy, I hope, doesn't die until the next movie, they have to at least let Emma Stone complete the trilogy. They have to kill her though, for the sake of true fans, they have to stay true to what we expect of the movies. It's the same as killing the characters in Walking Dead that die in the Graphic Novels. Some things have to happen for the sake of the story advancement.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"¬†
Quran (2:244) - ""Then fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah Heareth and knoweth all things.""
¬†
Quran (2:216) - ""Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not.""¬† Not only does this verse establish that violence can be virtuous, but it also contradicts the myth that fighting is intended only in self-defense, since the audience was obviously not under attack at the time.¬† From the Hadith, we know that this verse was narrated at a time that Muhammad was actually trying to motivate his people into raiding merchant caravans for loot.
¬†
Quran (3:56) - ""As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.""
¬†
Quran (3:151) - ""Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority"".¬† This speaks directly of polytheists, yet it also includes Christians, since they believe in the Trinity (ie. what Muhammad incorrectly believed to be 'joining companions to Allah').
¬†
Quran (4:74) - ""Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.""¬† The martyrs of Islam are unlike the early Christians, led meekly to the slaughter.¬† These Muslims are killed in battle, as they attempt to inflict death and destruction for the cause of Allah.¬† Here is the theological basis for today's suicide bombers.
¬†
Quran (4:76) - ""Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah‚Ä¶""
¬†
Quran (4:89) - ""They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): But take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of Allah (From what is forbidden). But if they turn renegades, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks.""
¬†
Quran (4:95) - ""Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit (at home). Unto all (in Faith) Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit (at home) by a special reward,-""¬† This passage criticizes ""peaceful"" Muslims who do not join in the violence, letting them know that they are less worthy in Allah's eyes.¬† It also demolishes the modern myth that ""Jihad"" doesn't mean holy war in the Quran, but rather a spiritual struggle.¬† Not only is the Arabic word used in this passage, but it is clearly not referring to anything spiritual, since the physically disabled are given exemption.¬† (The Hadith reveals the context of the passage to be in response to a blind man's protest that he is unable to engage in Jihad and this is reflected in other translations of the verse).
¬†
Quran (4:104) - ""And be not weak hearted in pursuit of the enemy; if you suffer pain, then surely they (too) suffer pain as you suffer pain...""¬† Is pursuing an injured and retreating enemy really an act of self-defense?
¬†
Quran (5:33) - ""The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this, that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned; this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world, and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement""
¬†
Quran (8:12) - ""I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them""¬† No reasonable person would interpret this to mean a spiritual struggle.
¬†
Quran (8:15) - ""O ye who believe! When ye meet those who disbelieve in battle, turn not your backs to them. (16)Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey's end.""
¬†
Quran (8:39) - ""And fight with them until there is no more fitna (disorder, unbelief) and religion should be only for Allah""¬† Some translations interpret ""fitna"" as ""persecution"", but the traditional understanding of this word is not supported by the historical context (See notes for¬† 2:293, also).¬† The Meccans were simply refusing Muhammad access to their city during Haj.¬† Other Muslims were allowed to travel there - just not as an armed group, since Muhammad had declared war on Mecca prior to his eviction.¬† The Meccans were also acting in defense of their religion, since it was Muhammad's intention to destroy their idols and establish Islam by force (which he later did).¬† Hence the critical part of this verse is to fight until ""religion is only for Allah"", meaning that the true justification of violence was the unbelief of the opposition.¬† According to the Sira (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 324) Muhammad further explains that ""Allah must have no rivals.""
¬†
Quran (8:57) - ""If thou comest on them in the war, deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them, that haply they may remember.""¬†¬†
¬†
Quran (8:59-60) - ""And let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip (Allah's Purpose). Lo! they cannot escape.¬† Make ready for them all thou canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy.""
¬†
Quran (8:65) - ""O Prophet, exhort the believers to fight...""
¬†
Quran (9:5) - ""So when the sacred months have passed away, then slay the idolaters wherever you find them, and take them captive and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush, then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate, leave their way free to them.""¬† According to this verse, the best way of staying safe from Muslim violence is to convert to Islam (prayer (salat) and the poor tax (zakat) are among the religion's Five Pillars).¬† This popular claim that the Quran only inspires violence within the context of self-defense is seriously challenged by this passage as well, since the Muslims to whom it was written were obviously not under attack.¬† Had they been, then there would have been no waiting period (earlier verses make it a duty for Muslims to fight in self-defense, even during the sacred months).¬† The historical context is Mecca after the idolaters were subjugated by Muhammad and posed no threat.¬† Once the Muslims had the power, they violently evicted those unbelievers who would not convert.
¬†
Quran (9:14) - ""Fight them, Allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace...""
¬†
Quran (9:20) - ""Those who believe, and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in Allah's way are of much greater worth in Allah's sight. These are they who are triumphant.""¬† The Arabic word interpreted as ""striving"" in this verse is the same root as ""Jihad"".¬† The context is obviously holy war.
¬†
Quran (9:29) - ""Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.""¬† ""People of the Book"" refers to Christians and Jews.¬† According to this verse, they are to be violently subjugated, with the sole justification being their religious status.¬† This was one of the final ""revelations"" from Allah and it set in motion the tenacious military expansion, in which Muhammad's companions managed to conquer two-thirds of the Christian world in the next 100 years.¬† Islam is intended to dominate all other people and faiths.
¬†
Quran (9:30) - ""And the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah; and the Christians say: The Messiah is the son of Allah; these are the words of their mouths; they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before; may Allah destroy them; how they are turned away!""
¬†
Quran (9:38-39) - ""O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place.""¬† This is a warning to those who refuse to fight, that they will be punished with Hell.
¬†
Quran (9:41) - ""Go forth, light-armed and heavy-armed, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of Allah! That is best for you if ye but knew.""¬† See also the verse that follows (9:42) - ""If there had been immediate gain (in sight), and the journey easy, they would (all) without doubt have followed thee, but the distance was long, (and weighed) on them""¬† This contradicts the myth that Muslims are to fight only in self-defense, since the wording implies that battle will be waged a long distance from home (in another country and on Christian soil, in this case, according to the historians).
¬†
Quran (9:73) - ""O Prophet! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them; and their abode is hell, and evil is the destination.""¬† Dehumanizing those who reject Islam, by reminding Muslims that they are merely firewood for Hell, makes it easier to justify slaughter.¬† It also explains why today's devout Muslims have little regard for those outside the faith.
¬†
Quran (9:88) - ""But the Messenger, and those who believe with him, strive and fight with their wealth and their persons: for them are (all) good things: and it is they who will prosper.""
¬†
Quran (9:111) - ""Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain: a promise binding on Him in truth, through the Law, the Gospel, and the Quran: and who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded: that is the achievement supreme.""
¬†
Quran (9:123) - ""O you who believe! fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness.""
¬†
Quran (17:16) - ""And when We wish to destroy a town, We send Our commandment to the people of it who lead easy lives, but they transgress therein; thus the word proves true against it, so We destroy it with utter destruction.""¬† Note that the crime is moral transgression, and the punishment is ""utter destruction.""¬† (Before ordering the 9/11 attacks, Osama bin Laden first issued Americans an invitation to Islam).¬†
¬†
Quran (18:65-81) - This parable lays the theological groundwork for honor killings, in which a family member is murdered because they brought shame to the family, either through apostasy or perceived moral indiscretion.¬† The story (which is not found in any Jewish or Christian source) tells of Moses encountering a man with ""special knowledge"" who does things which don't seem to make sense on the surface, but are then justified according to later explanation.¬† One such action is to murder a youth for no apparent reason (74).¬† However, the wise man later explains that it was feared that the boy would ""grieve"" his parents by ""disobedience and ingratitude.""¬† He was killed so that Allah could provide them a 'better' son.¬† (Note: This is one reason why honor killing is sanctioned by Sharia.¬† Reliance of the Traveler (Umdat al-Saliq) says that punishment for murder is not applicable when a parent or grandparent kills their offspring (o.1.1-2).)
¬†
Quran (21:44) - ""We gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them; See they not that We gradually reduce the land (in their control) from its outlying borders? Is it then they who will win?""
¬†
Quran (25:52) - ""Therefore listen not to the Unbelievers, but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness...""¬†¬† ""Strive against"" is Jihad - obviously not in the personal context.¬† It's also significant to point out that this is a Meccan verse.
¬†

Just be quiet for once, and be a respectful member of the community who watches movies for their sole purpose: to entertain. If you constantly compare and analyse trailers and movies with no actual foundation for your claims then you're missing the whole aspect of entertainment. Don't keep saying that the movie is going to suck badly or really badly when you can't say that until you've seen the actual movie. It's almost as if you tell someone their idea is rubbish before even knowing what it is. Spidey is back, more importantly Sinister 6 is back, what more do you want?

They still have about 5 months give or take to polish it up. However, one thing I hated in the 1st one was the voice inconsistency behind the mask. Sometimes you could hear him clear like he didn't have the mask on & at other times he was muffled. In the mask, he's SUPPOSED to be muffled. Keep it that way. If he wants to talk to Aunt May on the phone, he traditionally (in the comics) raises his mask up to his nose so he isn't muffled.",2013-12-16T15:42:05.000Z,0

- Well would you rather see a 'body-builder guy' in a grey suit? Personally i think a robot suit, as we can see, would link nicely to Oscorp and the death of Peter's parents. We also see other suits, e.g The Vulture. Do you guys not think it would look kind of ridiculous to see a guy flapping around in a green tight suit? Yes it works in comics and cartoons, which we all love very much, but in a film like this something like what's shown' would be more appropriate no?¬†

Although Electro really should be in tune with the comics....kind of contradicting my argument abit but Electro looked badass in the comics.¬†",2013-12-16T01:37:41.000Z,4

Still this version of Spider-Man is great has Tobey version but in my opinion this Spider-Man is the best. I like how they make sense into Peter powers with Oscorp so its al united and make sense.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"List of Probs People have of the Trailer

1. CGI- not a problem, they have 5 months.
2. Harry Osborn- Guys, Dane Dehan was awesome in Chronicle, and don't worry his hair will spike up when he's the Goblin.
3. Spidey Suit- WTF first people complained of the first movie suit and said classic was better, but NOW you have it so STFU it's beautiful.
4. Villain Quantity- Main villain is Electro and it doesn't matter if he black Jamie Foxx is an awesome actor.
5. Rhino as a robot- For those who don't know it follows under Ultimate in which he's robotic. Who knows? it might just be a prototype and he'll be cross species genetics in later films :P
6. Symbiotes- Sorry but Venom and Carnage ain't gonna be here any time soon.

In conclusion, let's just watch the movie in May 2014 then all have a Tea Party to share our opinions about it afterwards.",2013-12-15T10:11:10.000Z,3

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"I'm a comic fanatic and Spiderman expert and not sure if i agree with the Rhino being the way he is and the fact that Gwen Stacy hasn't broken her neck yet as a result of an accident involving Spidey and the Goblin on the bridge ( although this might happen in the third movie when MJ comes i guess?), also Harry being the green goblin straight out with Norman having what looks like his cancer ark from the comics already? My brother and i are in a debate also whether or not the sinister six is involved in this due to the six chambers in the trailer but I'm not sure if I'm totally convinced, its like its been fast tracked in the comic storyline but yeah i am so happy that they finally got his suit with his eyes right so that makes me happy enough.plus i'm not being racist whatsoever but now that its happened to Nick Fury its also happened to Electro now as he is a white man in the comics which isn't a bad thing i'm just a massive marvel fan and now hes black and i'm just tired of them changing it from the comics CANT WAIT though apart from that stuff it does look FARKING AWESOME!!!!",2013-12-14T07:11:58.000Z,1

This happens at around the minute mark. My theory is that Harry just wants to make his father happy so he tests out the serum and gets mutated into the goblin that we see in the poster but something happens and it causes Norman to take the serum and he becomes the true Green Goblin. If it's not that then I think that Norman takes the serum as a last hope to survive and he becomes the GG. When Norman says ""we have a plan for you"" I think he is implying that the Sinister Six is in the works and Norman is warning Peter.

Just remember that in Spiderman 2, CGI was also very when they did the fight scene on the train. What matters is not that they used too much CGI in that scene and in the whole movie but the fact that it looked really awesome. I agree nowadays CGI is overused in movies but it just another movie making tool. The important thing is how CGI is applied and when used properly it can make movies look much better even if the scenes have not actually been filmed but artificially generated by software.",2013-12-13T02:56:40.000Z,0

He is the set up for the next movie. A lot of you guys are far from ignorant , I can tell how you quickly figured out the sinister 6 lead up.

I mean¬†I wasn't exactly thrilled by the costume from the first Amazing Spider-man film but i got used it, and¬†¬†actually quite liked the realistic and raw touch. So why did they change it into this? It looks like something from Ultimate Spider-man the game for playstation 2. It just not authentic at all. I mean yes he looks more like he does in the comics now, but i must admit i liked the costume a lot better in the first one and in Raimis version.¬†
I dont get the CGI either. I hope this is just a first bad trailer.. I mean the movie may be good anyway. But as for the CGI goes i must say the last amazing spider-man already looks 10 times better ¬†than this one.¬†

Getting a real ultimate vibe from this and all you guys being skeptical u have a right to be however lets not start judgin an entire movies quality on a trailer when we don't even know how alot of these storylines are going to play out. Don't worry about the amount of villains because Marc Webb himself said that the rhino is just in there for fun kinda like how scarecrow was in the beggining of the dark knight and guess what that movie also had 2 other major comic villains Joker and Two Face so guys think about all the aspects and possibilities of the movie before you rage. Also don't be so negative because you enjoyed the Raimi films its alright to like both I for one am just glad we are getting more movies on one of the greatest charcters in fiction.,2013-12-11T01:01:52.000Z,2

Then when Harry pulls up the oscorp files there's multiple Easter eggs. Like raven croft (carnage reference?) or the Austrian project.(kraven ?) and when Peter finds the lab in the sub way there's a mysterious black fluid in a tube to left. You thinking what I'm thinking ? And the best part to me is when there's 7 evil lair doors opening. Could this be the sinister 6 plus venom ? I'm so excited for this movie and I'm glad it's got a mysterious storyline to it so you can't see what's coming unlike ramis Spider-mans where you could see anything coming a mile away ,2013-12-10T19:11:17.000Z,1

I know there isn't a huge pool of history to choose from with Spiderman (lies), but the whole ""I'm getting more powerful so my enemies are more powerful so I must be more powerful to protect people who aren't powerful"" thing is getting a bit stale. I also liked Toby a lot more in the roll of Spiderman. I don't think they buffed him up enough, but personality wise he was a lot closer to Peter Parker. That said, some of these action set pieces look really incredible, and it I'm not going to lie and say the ones in the original trilogy were even close to these.

He was nothing, but a shallow and spoiled whiny brat, who only cared for no one, but himself. As the Oblingoblin there wasn't anything threatening about him either (in fact, Harry would probably be one of the lamest villains ever).¬†

No, he wasn't a jock but after the spider bite he did get super strength(check the comics its there). Toby Maguire actually had a similar physique to the original spider-man, comic average build that got enhanced by his spider bite. The biggest problem with this flick for me is ignoring the reason why peter does, what he does - ""with great power comes great responsibility"". Also canister shooters? - this was ret-conned in the amazing spider-man and even creator Stan Lee thought it was a no brainer(he even said that when he created him he didn't include the power to shoot web naturally, in order to focus the readers attention on peters' scientific skill that he will use through out the series), after all he did get super powers from a a spider bite.( by the way - I grew up reading the original spider-man comics and watching the fox-kids cartoon and never liked the web-canisters, so I'm not knocking it for no apparent reason. just never liked the fact that he didn't have the power to make the web naturally.)¬†",2013-12-10T15:51:51.000Z,0

I mean you have Electro, Rhino, and Goblin in this one, Doc Ock's arms and Vulture's wings at 1:13, and then all you have to do is bring back Lizard and that's six! Also, hopefully Goblin will just be a build-up villain in this one and be the main villain in TASM3. And I think I speak for all true Spider-Man fans in saying can Goblin please turn into an actual goblin for once?

If you think about it the other guy who played the old Spider-Man didn't really seem to fit the role. Yes, the old Spider-Man movies were pretty good, but I think that the new Spider-Man movies really make the audience stay at the edge of their seats. This new Spider-Man really captures what the comics were all about and gives it a new perspective on how the role of Spider-Man should be played. The old Spider-Man looked as if he was to fragile and didn't play the part as the heroic type described in the comics or books. This new Spider-Man seems to do the trick.",2013-12-10T05:45:10.000Z,2

""The Amazing Spider-Man"" feels like the comic book actually came alive, while the old trilogy just forced Spider-Man to come alive when it fell apart in many ways. Everybody says they miss Toby, but he fell short as Spider-Man. He was boring and tried to hard to look like a Spider-Man. Andrew though, actually looks like the actual high school Spider-Man, not some man in his late 20's. Yes this looks more cartoony, but that's how it's supposed to be.",2013-12-10T03:37:16.000Z,0

Earth-120703 looks like the best cinematic Marvel Universe. Unlike the X-Men movies (Earth 10005)¬†that just collapsed under their own weight like the 90's Comics did. I mean Origins, X1 and X2 were good but the rest were unneeded pointless storylines and had no actual point except to make money and were dead end storylines. Also kind of destroyed any complex foundation that could of made those movies a lot better. Also if people are complaining about this Spider-Man reboot series,¬†I doubt people aren't as impressed as me hearing rumours that after amazing 4 they are planning on rebooting Spider-Man again back into Earth 199999 (Avenger movie-verse) since there is a deal in place to buy the rights back later in the decade.",2013-12-10T02:44:47.000Z,0

Given the appearance of a bad guy in a glider in this film (we don't know yet what title Harry will take..), Gwen's movie appearances seem numbered. It's a bit of a pity, as I really like her chemistry with Peter, and I don't see the actress who was originally hired to play MJ in this film before being cut for the third movie as having as much of an overall impact on audiences.",2013-12-09T22:46:23.000Z,0

A closer look at images of the screen at :52 reveal Dr. Morbious file(Morbious from the comics, and the canon video game that came out with The 1st film already established Dr. Morbious as loving bats), A Dr. Connors file and a Venom Storage. We also see Harry entering into a lab area(Harry is rumored to become The Hobgoblin) as well so everything is in place for The Sinister Six. My guess is the 3rd film will feature Vulture and Doctor Octopus and will reveal Venom(who will get his own film to further his character.) All parties return for The 4th and final film which will feature The SInister Six with Venom, Hobgoblin, Morbious and Lizard helping Peter against The Sinister Six as at this point they realize just how much the world needs Spider-Man.

You'd figure they'd learn from past mistakes. Electro and Rhino are more than likely getting zero character development and will be evil for evil's sake, and the film will probably spend a lot of screentime developing Green Goblin, rehashing the dynamic we saw in the first trilogy, cramming it all into one film opposed to three.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"The scene where the guy is walking through the hall, you see Doc Oc's tentacles in one case and The Vulture's wings in another. Plus the scene with the guy in the techish armor standing on the glider.

There's enough set-up here for at least another 3 or 4 more movies. If they do it right and they keep making money, this guy could play Spider-Man for the rest of his life and they could make at least 12 to 16 movies. That would be EPIC!!!",2013-12-08T21:18:24.000Z,0

It doesn¬¥t even feel like a movie it feels more like a video game (thank u bad CGI). Lots of scenes are just rip offs of Sam Raimi¬¥s version (just proves how good it was they had to copy it). The villains look terrible and laughable (smurf avatar electro, rockstar drag queen goblin and transformer rhino). Poor cast, overloaded and terrible special effects. if the script is good enough it could save this movie but I doubt that taking in counter that the first amazing spiderman wasn¬¥t amazing at all. ¬†",2013-12-08T21:00:00.000Z,1

Regardless of the fact that Alfred Molina was a badass Doc Ock. What pisses me off are these people bitching about the look of the villains.  Let me explain something. While the last film and this one are call The Amazing Spider-Man, they're based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comics & cartoon. Electro and Rhino look sick.

Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love (Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 1:]
What you doing in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking 'round, always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complaining
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what we do, don't tell your mom shit
This that red cup, all on the lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you something to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admitting is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it, Thanksgiving
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on the wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Charlie Wilson:]
I know you're tired of loving, of loving
No hiding your love, no hiding, no hiding
Just grab somebody, no leaving this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

You're paying to see big dumb Hollywood remakes (say what you will but all they did was change the villains around... same basic idea done worse but with more special effects and ""epicness"") of decent movies by Sam Raimi. Spiderman is NOT some big, epic saga like fucking Avengers (which itself isn't epic either, but...). Raimi captured the perfect atmosphere for Spiderman to be set in; it is a character story more than anything. Yet these movies just make Spiderman Generic Hollywood Action Hero # 235325 and put Generic Hollywood Villains against him with Generic Hollywood Attractive Love Interest and Generic Other Characters for good measure. There is no genuine creativity or heart behind any of this, just a bunch of Hollywood producers shoving in shit that dumb masses wanna see. Ask yourself: if this movie had NO computer effects at all, would it still be a ""good"" movie? Yes the Sam Raimi film had special effects but it was more about what went on BEHIND the fighting and WHY the fighting was done and not just Spiderman beating up Jamie Foxx in a shitty costume (a la Arnold Fuckhislastname as Mr. Freeze) because ACTION!

Fucking hate you people and your lack of wanting something better for yourself. All you do is shovel shit in your mouths and accept it as long as Hollywood sprinkles some sugar on top. Fuck that. This is entertainment at its basest and most trivial levels; if you pay to see this movie and are excited to see it, you are without a doubt a drooling moron. Sorry, that is fact. You can still want to see it but please download it for free... do NOT pay Sony to watch this schlock that looks and feels like a computer program put it together. You are actually killing everything that makes humanity awesome by doing so, and I would punch you between the eyes if I saw you hand money to see it.",2013-12-08T18:59:08.000Z,0

What would've been better is if they stuck with the Amazing Spiderman story. If there is any hope of Spiderman returning to big screens it is either he is in the Avengers 3, or in a reboot except it going with the new Superior Spiderman storyline.

I mean, seriously, how is this new Spider-Man any different than watching Twilight? Only, this is for comic book geeks... not tween girls obsessed with vampires.

I don't know. This just feels kind of boring. I mean, there's no character in any of it that we didn't see in the Fantastic Four. Here's Bad Guy #1, how is Spider-Man gonna stop him? Oh, there's the answer, before we even get to know Bad Guy #1. Sounds like it's really worth 12 to 15 dollars of my money.

Movies are about characters. NOT about how many cool fight scenes our hero can have with the villains.

Love or hate Tobey and Kirsten... but there was CHARACTER in their relationship. There was even character in their first kiss... which has become an iconic image that these latest movies can't seem to top.",2013-12-08T09:23:00.000Z,9

The word (Jesus) was with God, The same was in ¬†the beginning with God. and was God. All things were made by Him and without Him, was not anything made that was made. John 1:1- 3
Jesus is not merely a prophet and He was never an angel nor a spirit being that was produced by God the Father having relations with a female deity as the Mormon church purports. Jesus or Yahshua is God. Yahshua means, Yah or Yahweh (Yah is the contraction form of Yahweh) is salvation or Yahweh saves.
After Thomas, saw Jesus Christ risen from the dead, he said, My Lord and My God to Jesus (John 20:28). Jesus did not rebuke Thomas or attempt to stop him. Indeed, Jesus never rebuked anyone for worshiping Him. The Bible states that you are to worship, the LORD your God, and Him alone you shall serve. If Jesus was not God, He would have never allowed anyone to worship Him.
Acts 20: 28 states: Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the whole flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of God which He (God) hath purchased with His own blood. Who shed His blood on the cross in order to redeem or purchase us? Jesus. Patently, this verse (Acts 20: 28) demonstrates that Jesus Christ is God!
Jesus said that if ye have seen Me, ye have seen the Father and the Father and I are one. Because there is only God who is triune in nature.¬†
The Father is Yahweh, the Son is Yahweh and the Holy Spirit is Yahweh.
Genesis 19: 24 states:
Then the LORD (Yahweh) rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD (Yahweh) out of heaven; In this Scripture we can obviously see that there are two Persons in two different locations who are called LORD (Yahweh).
Furthermore, this is corroborated in Mathew 28: 19:


Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:

Notice: The aforementioned verse does not say baptize them in the names (plural), but in the name (singular). Because the Father is God (Yahweh), the Son is God (Yahweh), and the Holy Spirit is God is God (Yahweh).

Jesus was not merely a prophet, nor an angel, nor did He have a beginning.
When Jesus said, before Abraham was, I AM, He boldly declared His deity. Jesus did not say before Abraham was, I was or I have been as the New World Translation erroneously prints, but before Abraham was, I AM ( ŒïŒ≥œâ ŒïŒπŒºŒπ ). John 8: 58
Afterwards those who were listening picked up stones to kill Him. Why? Because Jesus identified Himself as God. When Moses asked God (YAHWEH) Who shall I say sent me, God told Moses to tell his fellow Hebrews ¬†that I AM sent you. Exodus 3: 14

This is why Jesus Christ's suffering and death on the cross was such a tremendous sacrifice. The Creator (all things were made by Him) died for His creation. This is confirmed by the following verses.

Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: Phil 2: 6
¬†not robbery to be EQUAL WITH GOD! The only way one can be equal to God is if He is God. (The word was God ... Jesus is the word of God).
¬†Phl 2:7
But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:

¬†Phl 2:8
And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
¬†God, Himself- the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, came down as a man and died. God did not send down an angel or a pre-existent angel or spirit being that was produced by Him having relations with a female deity. As we saw earlier in Acts 20: 28 that God, (namely the Second Person of the Holy Trinity- Jesus Christ), purchased the church with His own blood. God the Son (Jesus Christ) came down as a man and shed His own blood to purchase the church (those who have received Christ as their Savior). Why would God pay such a tremendous price? Love! God is not willing (desiring) that anyone should perish (suffer in eternal torment in hell). For God so LOVED the world ¬†that He gave His only Son that whosoever (means anyone) ¬†believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3: 16
How does one receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior?
Repeat the following prayer to God.
Jesus, I ask you to forgive all of my sins, everything wrong that I have ever done, all wrong thoughts, wrong actions and wrong words and for not doing the things that I should have done or said. Forgive me. Come into my heart and live in me by your Spirit. Help me to know and turn away from that which displeases You. Help me to spend time with You in prayer and the Bible and to attend a Christian Church that Honors You and Your word. Help me to live for You as long as I live.
Jesus thank You for forgiving all of my sins. Thank You that You now live in me.
Amen

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Tobey McGuire was the better Peter Parker, for the first two films. It's difficult watching this new guy... well, at least they don't seem so focused on showing his face.

This is the ugliest rendition of Electro I've ever seen, but just like TDKR's Bane, that can be made up for by how well he's written and how imposing the actor is.

The special effects look kind of bad, but sort of like a comic book, which could be a nice plus. Time will tell.

Not to thrilled with Mary Jane replaced by Gwen Stacy, but then they don't want this to be a complete rehash of the Raimi films.

People who say all the Raimi films were bad didn't watch the first two; Spider-Man 3 just left a mark on the internet that people always bring up. The first two were quite good; the first was one of the best superhero adaptions out at the time, and the second had/HAS one of the most impressive superhero fight scenes in existence, with only The Avengers and Man of Steel coming close.",2013-12-08T00:33:06.000Z,0

The re-introduction of more characters from the Spider-man Trilogy is clearly going to raise the level that must be reached in order to compete with the older trilogy- where its first 2 movies were a great success; the second 'Spiderman 2' ¬†is widely regarded as one of, if not the best super-hero movie of all time (how can they better that?).

This film will not fail because of having too many villains. Yes Spider-Man 3 was terrible but not because of the villians, IT'S BAD WRITING. If written well, 3 villians are absolutely fine. If you watch/read interviews with the film crew, they know what they're doing and they've said multiple times that they're not going to use characters that don't need to be there; but all these characters are necessary to make the story that they are building.

And Sony looks more involved in this movie... which, if Spider-man 3 is any indication, does not bode well. Seriously, 3 villains? Didn't anyone learn from Spider-man 3 that it ruins the pacing of the movie? And it seems like a CGI actionfest (again that screams Sony to me). Everyone should look towards Spider-man 2 as an amazing blend of action and storytelling that stayed true to the flavor of the comics. The last Amazing Spider-man didn't feel like ASM at all... more like Ultimate Spider-man or some angsty modern comic that feels so whiney at times. Hopefully I'm proved wrong and this movie is fantastic, but it looks pretty bad right now.",2013-12-07T18:53:42.000Z,0

All that tells me is that you've never read a dang comic book. The guy who loves and supports Aunt May, goes out of his way to help and support people, and has a severe case of the Parker Luck is ""nothing like the comic?"" Oh please. If anything I'd say he was closer (anything's closer than Peter helping you-know-who's death along in the last film and treating May like shit). There's a reason Spider-Man 1 and 2 are frequently on best comic book films of all time lists. Hating on things doesn't make you cool, it makes you pathetic.


To those hating on Andrew, ik the first movie really wasn't that great, and all my fellow comic fans will know that at times it was absolutely nothing like the Spidey we know. However, everyone deserves a second chance, and the first film DID have some good qualities to it, so let's not completely comdemn this film.

One, Jamie Foxx... Two, Paul Giamatti as well... Talents just cashing in if you ask me...

Also, Hans Zimmer is now doing the score? He's been rapidly losing his credibility over the last few years. Making a lot of similar-sounding scores and just being hired for being a popular name now. Where was all this interest when he did 'The Lion King' and 'The Prince of Egypt'??... But nooo, ""The Dark Knight"" is way more important. Fantastic score, but that the only reason they now pulled him in for Spider-Man... Oh, not to mention going up against Danny Elfman (an overly hated but genius composer) his score. There's no contest, he was perfect for that, Hans Zimmer is basically a ""miscast"" out of pure popularity.

Anyway, eeeveryone is going to disagree (except the ones who know what I'm talking about) out of pure ignorance and fanboyism of course. :P
It's just... pf, you can just tell these people are there for the money (probably because of big offers from Sony), but out-of-place and aren't really right for the job, and actually even above this movie.

Unfortunately it's not enough to stand out from what we saw in the early 2000. I don't like the delivery on the lines, the Oscorp feel is very 'Ultimate' and Elektro's lines feel inappropriate. The scale of the character and conflict is being oversold: this is Spiderman, not the Avengers. A personal struggle, not an end-of-the-world scenario.
This is not the reboot we need. The reboot we need sees Spidey incorporated into the complete Marvel movie universe Iron Man kickstarted. Until then it's just rehash of what Tobey did better.",2013-12-07T16:39:18.000Z,0

It does bug me though when people moan and moan about Rhino not being what they want or that there are too many villains. To me this trailer showed that Rhino likely only appears twice, firstly when he is on a rampage in his¬†truck and then again later when he is rampaging in the rhino armour. I recon that electro will have a small background and harry will have the biggest. And I personally think Rhino is everything I hoped for.

2. I have to say making Harry as the Goblin was stupid as they already did that in Spiderman 3, plus it feels like Spiderman 3 as he is yet again threatened by 3 villains & Goblin will be apart of that trio once again
3. Another thing is from what we've seen from this trailer the new Goblin looks like Raiden from The Metal Gear games, also he looks just like his counter-part from Spiderman 3 just with a ridiculous haircut

Ya, i know they own the rights to the movies, but still...show some love. Anyway, spidey is my favorite, and love anything he touches but...icant help but think this is sony cashing in ! Wheres the warmth, the rich character development of the first two raimi movies ?

I grew up with THE AMAZING brand of spider man, so why am i getting the ULTIMATE treatment ? And why does everyone have such douchey hair cuts ? Just questions from a beloved fan. Still going to see it the flick.",2013-12-07T07:05:12.000Z,0

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"This trailer looks awesome, now I could be just biased, because Spider-man is one of my favorite super heroes, but this looks so cool. It looks like they got the posing on point, the costume looks great, maybe the eyes are a lil too big or a lil strange looking at certain angles, but it‚Äôs the costume fans have been waiting for.

The CG looks good, a lil fake, but what are you expecting a real guy go out and perform these stunts? I understand people‚Äôs concern with cg and hey I wish a lot of people could actually do a performance like what is shown in real life, but I‚Äôm guessing the cg is still not 100%, since they have till May of next year of post production.

¬†Tbh I didn‚Äôt really like Andrew Garfield in ASM, yes he has the look of a perfect Spider-man/Peter Parker, tall, skinny, lanky, with a little bit of muscle, but he was way to awkward for me and very quiet. I know Pete is an awkward guy, but he had friends, he wasn‚Äôt completely socially awkward. It looks like Andrew stepped his game up in this one.

I see a lot of people complaining about rhino, Rhino was a guy in a Mechanical suit in the Ultimate version in the comics¬† (which a lot of the movie costumes are based off of) but this does look a lil too transformerish for me. I guess I‚Äôll just have to wait and see. I also think they made him mechanical, because Sony doesn‚Äôt have the best cg artists around, they‚Äôre good, but not the best and the lizard in the last movie looked super fake, but it‚Äôs a fucking 7 ft. tall lizard, so I understand why it looked fake, but I think Sony should try and get the guys who do the Hulk in the Avengers movie, because that‚Äôs as real as a hulk in the movies is gonna get, unless they go back to body builders in green pant. So maybe it was easier for them to make him mechanical.

My other concern is Jamie Foxx, great actor, I enjoy a lot of movies he‚Äôs been in, but he seems too calm to be Electro, the Electro I know is crazy, loud and seems like a psychopath, I‚Äôm hoping they haven‚Äôt showed the best of him yet.",2013-12-07T06:31:16.000Z,1

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Here's the thing that bothers me ... starting with the Batman series with Michael Keaton in 1989, there seems to have been a precedent set, where the more sequels you have, the more bad guys you have to cram into a movie. I think the only one that has handled multiple baddies well has been the more recent Christopher¬† Nolan vision of Batman. Just because it was sort of well managed into the story and not a ""hey, we have completely different goals, but lets join forces to kill the hero"" sort of plotline. The Tobey Maguire sequels are a great example of that. Why did the morally sound¬†Sand Man, who was only doing bad stuff for the sake of his family, join forces with Venom?¬†Just because.¬†Don't ask questions.¬†

So this movie is going to jam in¬†Electro, Rhino AND a Goblin? I have my doubts they will be able to present all of that in a way that doesn't just seem like a bad tradeoff between action and story. The way to make a good movie is to have the story drive the action, not the other way around....

Also, seems like they are trying to avoid the bad guys from the last series, except now the Goblin ... but I would really love to see a re-envisioning of Venom, because Spiderman 3 did a terrible, terrible job with it.",2013-12-07T05:47:46.000Z,0

I really don't mean to be nit picky, and I really don't know how Marc Webb is gonna handle Goblin, I just hope that he handles the character respectfully and correctly.

First of all, the problem with Spiderman 3 wasn't that it had too many villians, it was the bad writing.
Second, whats wrong with the CGI? Audiences have been so hypotised by realistic special effects that all of a sudden if they try to make it look more comicbook-like or colourful it's shit? Nah.
Thirdly, Electro and Rhino look fucking awesome and perfectly fit in to this universe that Marc Webb is creating. They're both based off their Ultimate Universe counterparts because their mainstream counterparts would just look ridiculous. Let's be realistic.
And finally, those saying that Sony are just making this for the money are so damn naive it hurts. If you look up information and listen/read to what Marc Webb and his team are doing. Simply put they're planning an incredible story and it's going to be awesome.

Remember we still have 4 months to wait till release date, stop being so fucking ignorant and wait till the damn film comes out to judge it.",2013-12-07T01:53:56.000Z,4

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"The movie looks awesome from the trailer but I'm worried about a few things:
1) The posters seem to imply Harry Osborn will be the original Green Goblin. If that's true that's a gutsy and controversial choice that could potentially mess up the storyline if not handled carefully.
2) Electro seems to have a smaller role than we anticipated judging by the trailer.
3) 3 major villains in 1 movie? I hope Marc Webb plays this one REALLY carefully because that was a fatal flaw in Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 3"" that helped fuck up the movie.

Given how many villains there are I expect at least 1 to die. I don't want it to be Electro, because he seems the most interesting of the 3 so far, but I have a feeling he's the most likely candidate. Rhino is a later villain and Green Goblin is a very important and pivotal villain for Spidey. He's too important to be offed in one movie shared with other villains taking up screentime. He would require a movie where he's Spidey's only villain before he's killed off, like Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie. Rhino is the villain I'd personally be least upset about dying.",2013-12-07T01:46:24.000Z,14

2. CGI is needed for pretty much all Super Hero Movies GET USE TO IT!?!?!?!?
3. We are living in a world where action in hero movies is more likeable than romance
4. Spider-Man 1-3 were good and focused on relationships with the characters more than Spider-man being the web slinging trash talker we all know.(Not a bad thing) (Spider-man 3 Venom.....Just no)
5. I count 3 possibly 4 villains in this movie, BUT THE MAIN VILLAIN IS (ELECTRO)

Simply Perfect! As always with Sony supreendendo your movies! Funny that the dream is to see the various Spider Man with the Avengers movie.

But the problem is that ""The Spider Man can not appear in the film because the rights of the character in the film is from Sony Pictures, and they intend to do some more films to return the character to Disney owns Marvel, which is currently the studio Avengers. ""

But in the meantime, let's enjoy each of these releases large companies!!

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"""Amazing"" is just a title change to differentiate THIS series from Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" trilogy. Just like ""Ang Lee's Hulk"" (2003)¬†and ""The Incredible Hulk"" reboot (2008). Marc Webb took some elements of ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" along with his own ideas and interpretations and used them to create the new universe for ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". Spider-Man 4 was going to happen, but Tobey Maguire had back problems, Kirsten Dunst didn't want to get her teeth fixed and Rami was pretty much done with the story he told. The series was good only because its what we grew up with. It was great for ITS time. Its 10 years later, YOU are not who you were 10 years ago, so why should Peter Parker/Spider-Man be any different? In the comics there are over 100 different dimensions and universes. Who is to say this isn't a different one all together? This wont be a ""Spider-Man 3"". The problem with that movie was that those 3 villains had no connection and no real reason to team up and Venom was not done justice. The comic books are easily able to adapt many characters and with the right direction and story, so can it be¬†on film. In this film, all of these villains have OsCorp in common. OsCorp is the common denominator, there is reason for these villains to exist. There is a reason why this¬†new series¬†is called ""The Spectacular Spider-Man in other countries. Has anyone seen the cartoon of the same name? It is the same plot! Bottom line, Spider-Man is Spider-Man and this is going to be a great film.",2013-12-06T19:12:38.000Z,1

But i dont know i thought toby Maguire was a better spider man until he went emo. Then that person from that 70s show was venom.(your kidding me) venom is supposed to be a beast a huge mother f'er .

QUESTION: There are Seven or several doors (6 open up from what I see) So, could it be that Harry is looking at The Sinister Six Characters?

Also, taking another look..at 1:18 you see numbered doors 3-4--6-7, is the 5th door the big black one and if so, could the reason it's big be because either Sandman or Mysterio is behind it? ¬†BUT at 1:20 you clearly see a Door 5 and only 1 and 2 are off screen. ¬†AGAIN, I'M LOOKING AT THIS AS AN END SCENE TO WHICH THE SINISTER SIX ARE POSSIBLY REVEALED.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"This does look great but... there is so many villains...and it looks like the writers have bundled all their amazing back stories into one plot point that is Oscorp. So instead of each villain having a relatable background from the comics, the reason for their powers, abilities and move over to the bad guy zone are shoved together together as a creation of a corporation. Electro, Rhino, Venom (0:52 look for venom project), Vulture, Dr. Octopus and Green Goblin. Great characters that could be ruined by becoming instantly two dimensional. ¬†Seems like a quick lazy way to throw some bad guys together, make something like the sinister six and blow shit up.

Having said that I would genuinely like to be proved wrong as I love Marc Webb, Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield and think Spider-Man is an awesome character for the movies. So fingers crossed that trailer analysis I just made is off the mark and we see something great.¬†",2013-12-06T17:37:16.000Z,7

One is the 2nd green Goblin, one is Electro, and the other is one of Oscorp's mechs that somehow spiderman defeats, and it seems to nod in the direction of Rhino in design.¬†
Know what I would think would be funny? If Rhino and Shocker kept having cameos in each movie, as like a 5 minute comedy relief, being like the Abbot and Costello of Spider-Man Villains.
It's sad that in Spider Man 3 Venom replaced Vulture. Vulture would have fit in more as a villian in that movie, about stealing people's youth. That would have led to a more appropriate storyline of forgiveness. You would have had 3 very different villians that all wore green!
THEN, in contrast to the heros learning forgiveness, either have venom be the villian in the next movie who turns good to fight, I dunno Carnage, or make the movie more about Venom vs Carnage than Spider-Man.
Be cool to see Spider Man join the Avengers, along with Wolverine.",2013-12-06T17:19:19.000Z,0

For those that are aware and those that do not take the time to remember old Spidey movie news, if Raimi was not bullied into putting Venom in the film, we would have had a classic Sinister Six culmination in his universe.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Here is one of my opinions why the Spiderman's CGI looks bad:

* They blew up with the budget, explaning why the rest of the VFXs look awesome.
* Or because they made the trailer like this so we can have bad expectations on the trailer, surprising us when the movie be release. The sequel can be bad since it has the same guys that did the first movie, including the same director and writter

If it has a bad writter, they wouldn't care to make the movie bad. That what happened to Highlander 2.",2013-12-06T15:28:46.000Z,1

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Difference Between Marvel and DC movies:

1. DC movies have much more real life emotions, Marvel movies are full of terrible coincidences and unnecessary twists and turns.
2.In DC movies hero can be miserable at some instances and its not that the hero always wins,in Marvel the hero's character is over exaggerated.
3.The picture quality and depth of every frame looks more real than the Marvels all sunny day fairy tale stories.
4.The stories are told in more comprehensible manner which are easy to digest and the reasons for something to happen are very obvious and connected,Marvel movies have reprehensible story tracks and feels absolutely fictional.
5.DC has more grown ups attitude in their movies and does not essentially requires Popcorn,Popcorn is must before entering a Marvel Movie !!!!!

Im a big fan of Marvel and DC both, X-Men , Spiderman with Tobey Maguire is my all time favorite movie but this what i felt and i guess everybody does about Marvel and DC.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD)," I give this trailer 7 out of 10 stars. Could have been better put together, and less of Andrew Garfields long speach. And they hardly really showed Jamie Fox. Let Down. Should been like like a 80% - 20% of screen  time for both.
 Other then that I really liked the preview, it was entertaining, fast paced, and made me wonder. I mean 90% of the gross of people here will see this movie regardless of a 7 out of 10 preview or even no preview.

Can't wait to really dive into this new cinematic Universe Sony is trying to make. Will it beat Marvels? YOU decide. 

And did anyone catch Doc Ocks Tentacles and Vultures Wings half way threw?

Hope they have a tiny nerdy fat man to play him. Haha Would be Awesome! 

I'm rooting for this movie though! Go! Half baked CGI! Make us proud! :D ",2013-12-06T12:48:41.000Z,1

Only problem i have with that is they have tried the multi villain team up before and it didn't work.need i remind you all of the epic failure that was Batman and ribbon, Batman forever and Spiderman 3. The ones i can think of at the moment, not to sure if there has ever been a successful one. I guess it can be said the Batman returns wasn't a total flop but i think that is more the result of Tim Burton and the actors used. I mean seriously, Georg Clooney as Batman, what the Hell were they thinking that's like casting Ben Aflake(sure misspelled) as Batman. Oh wait they did that, good job guys.

The director marc webb listened to you guys and gave you what you wanted, and now you guys are going to bitch about how animated it looks? give these guys a break. This movie is going to be by far the best spider man movie. And the CGI looks fine they will obviously make improvements.

The CGI is probably the only thing that's consistently good about the movies. The cast in all of them are more than talented enough, but they're not given good material to work with. I'm not expecting the films to be as good as the The Dark Knight trilogy, but is it too much¬† to ask for the filmmakers to make Peter Parker appear less depressing, and insert more of Spidey's famous wit in the script ! Andrew Garfield isn't the worst choice for the role, but he needs to make his character more likeable than the previous film.

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"In the original Spider-Man movies, there was no real origin consistency. Peter was bitten by a mutated spider, Goblin was a psycho with uninspired Iron Man armor, Sandman was a freak lab mutation, Venmon an alien, and Octavius stuck with a machine gone wrong. But it seems like for this new universe of the Amazing Spider-Man series - at least from the trailer - they could be setting it up so that some sort of cybernetic/mutative basis behind each empowered villiain. Lizard's gene splicing gas shooter, Doc Ock's tentacles and Vulture's wings, Rhino's armor, even Goblin's jet and Spidey's decidedly non-organic web-shooters: this version of Spider-Man looks like it wants to mix tech AND evolution equally, with Electro maybe as the next quantum step. After that, the logical way to continue the story for the third movie would be creation of the Sinister Six with the full compliment of animalistic villains (add Scorpion, Chameleon, and maybe Shocker for comedy relief). Just one full movie that's straight up pretty much nothing but villain after villain beating down Spider-Man until he just can't get back up. If they establish a consistent origin, they can skip the tedious backstory that bored everybody with Sandman and just get into the action. They can limit that 3rd movie to 1 1/2 hrs if it's just Electro zapping while Vulture holds Aunt May hostage and Scorpion and Rhino rip up the city and Chameleon causes chaos all as a distraction while Dr. Octopus goes after the real prize and Spidey has to race from one end of Manhattan to the other just trying to hold things together.

Then for the 4th movie, continue the bio-tech theme with OzCorp trying creating the ultimate adaptive weapon - possibly utilizing Spidey's DNA (or at least Papa Parker's theories from the first film that Peter and Dr. Conners refined) to create the Venom symbiote. In fact, by waiting to introduce Harry until now, they can practically follow the Ultimate comics storyline, and maybe also set up a fifth movie by hinting that there were a bunch of failed clones of Peter in the process of trying to replicate his DNA for a Clone Saga movie (just imagine the love complications of Gwen Stacey AND Mary Jane who both think they're Peter's only girlfriend and are both right! Imagine it!).

Those are just ideas, Hollywood (but, seriously, I WILL give you that manuscript if you ask!). All I'm saying is that fans prefer a series that's internally consistent (if you don't believe me, google Prometheus), and that by sticking to a coherent set of rules rather than throwing in a new twists just to surprise and shock audiences, it's actually EASIER to write a good story. From the trailer it looks like they've got a good start.",2013-12-06T11:08:30.000Z,0

 1 Corinthians 15:20-22 KJV

But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.

Mathew 12:36-37

36But I tell you that everyone will have to give account on the day of judgment for every empty word they have spoken.¬†37 For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.‚Äù

2 Timothy: 8-9

So don‚Äôt be ashamed of the testimony about the Lord or of me, his prisoner. Instead, share the suffering for the good news, depending on God‚Äôs power.¬†9¬†God is the one who saved and called us with a holy calling. This wasn‚Äôt based on what we have done, but it was based on his own purpose and grace that he gave us in Christ Jesus before time began.


Seek Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ has done nothing wrong to you and he loves you unconditionally. He pretty much handed you salvation in a silver platter and more. What he asks of you is easy and the rewards are great and instant. 

Bless God and God Bless all who read this and may your hearts hunger to know him!

The original Spiderman movies were TERRIBLE they focused way to much on Peter Parker then they actually did Spidey dont get me wrong I know Peter Parker needs a huge role because he is Spiderman but the second and third ones in the trilogy had very little of Spiderman and virtually the whole movie was focused on his romance with MJ. Now on to the matter of Toby as Spidey, he played the nerd part fantastically so yes I give him props to that and honestly it was completely the director's fault in not making Spidey smarrt assy enough. I thoroughly enjoyed The 1st Amazing- Spiderman and this one looks even more AMAZING ;) hahaha and Im glad they are about to introduce the sinister six like on commenter said before me and yes SPOLIER ALERT like the other guy stated Stacy is supposed to die because Green Goblin throws her off a bridge and Spiderman shoots out webs to save her and the whiplash from the abrupt stop breaks her neck and she dies.¬†",2013-12-06T08:21:33.000Z,0

Spiderman - Great movie, made super hero flicks fun for a bit.
Spiderman 2 - Better story, better pacing, better villain, Tobey stops trying and drags the movie a bit
spiderman 3 - Too many villains, noone seemed to care that they were even in this movie.

A. Spiderman - Fresh face, still mopey, obviously influence by Nolan movies. Overall a better set up peice.

A Spiderman 2 - Not out yet, seems to be falling into the too many villains area, however style is decidedly shifted away from nolan and into reproducing Comic Book action: Time will tell, but it looks like after 5 movies they may finally be on the right track.

All the villains hinted at or shown with some positive creative updates/changes that all look good. Electro having a Bluetooth stuck to his head is kind of amusing but fitting.¬†Even if we can't see the Rhino's face when in the armor (which looks like actual armor instead of a suit). Hope the story holds up too, as well as the cast's performances.¬†Only thing I hope we might see is any superhero allies that might eventually come around since let's face it: we all know the Sinister Six team-up is inevitable in Spidey 3 or 4 (or both). Can't wait for May 2014, of which it'll only have 2 weeks to rack up the $$$ and then X-Men: Days of Future Past will come out (ugh, Fox).",2013-12-06T06:33:50.000Z,1

-The Rhino is a mechsuit. Fucking fuck.
-Electro seems like some clandestine super villain wanna be, instead of a greedy, selfish, petty thief with fabulous powers. Plus, he seems pissed about having god-like abilities and that's about half stupid.
-The kid playing Spider-Man cannot play a good Peter Parker. He plays a fine Spider-Man, but his Pete is lame and not in the endearing nerd way.
-So, all things Spidey-villain are made by Oscorp now? I saw Doc Ocks arms and Vultures flight harness and it made me very sad for their future characters.
-The Green Goblin looks like someone mashed the shitty Green Goblin from the Raimi pics together with a troll doll.
-FUCK YOU Hollywood.

Never before have I seen so many easter eggs regarding the Sinister Six, and I think it's great that they're trying to make up for the tons of sequel bait that the last movie did. I mean people complained about SM3 having too many villains, but with the Sinister Six being a possibility it really shouldn't be a surprise as to how many they were planning on cram in there.

I like the more iconic comic take on re-designing the suit and it really matches up with Brian Michael Bendis's Ultimate Spider-Man design which I definitely approve.

Way to distract us with Electro when you really plan on bring in the whole SNISTER SIX! This is an amazing coalition of a bunch of stuff, and I can see already that its going to flow together greatly! This is what the Dark Knight Rises was trying to be in some ways. I love the Sony marvel movies and I don't think this will make me think differently except maybe for some CGI. The first movie made it seem to me like they were going to make the sinister six all humanoid things, like the rhino or vulture, but as we see here they took the technological path. I really think this is a more ""realistic"" take on Spiderman, somewhat. I mean we can now see how so many villains could sprout up at the same time thanks to Osborne. But I really don't know if their just setting the sinister six up here, putting out rhino and electro early, and then Gwen Stacy's death, and the introduction of the Osborne's, then they'll wait till a 3rd movie to fully establish the sinister six as a whole, but because they market this as his biggest battle ever suggest that they're going to take it full on. I'm so impressed with this trailer, I know I'm making a lot of preconceptions based on a trailer, but its quality and what it entails, I just feel sure that this is going to be a good superhero movie. Disney Marvel Movies and DC Movies, they try to make their movies into different genres: comedy, dark, scifi, fantasy, etc. But this truly feels like a SUPERHERO movie, they don't change the character to match a tone, they change themselves to match the character and their world. I'm usually not a big spidey fan, it's just that this is the first trailer, first anything, that seems it will be a full on action packed straight from the comics movie, but with its own modifications that I feel improve it, for example as I stated earlier, Osborne leading the sinister six. This just seems like it is going to get everything right and I'm super thankful for Sony because they aren't trying to sail tickets using goldilocks with abs or dark cloaks and inhumanly deep voices. What I mean is, their advertising Spiderman and his world, not the actors and producers who are in/made the movie.",2013-12-06T04:14:42.000Z,0

Three villains in one does make it a ¬†bit complicated, but even just as a cartoon watcher I remember there being multiple eps with multiple villains. This series is trying to stay closer to the original story so it makes sense for them to take a big leap like this. As for the graphic complaint....really? These graphics are fantastic. I'm not one for all CG, but to say the graphics are bad is a bit ridiculous. Disney funds this series...which means they have tons of money flowing into this thing. WHICH MEANS that they put tons of money into the CG and it probably could be one of the best CG movies yet.¬†

To all of the haters & incoming trolls with ridiculous & irrelevant complaints about Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man or Jamie Foxx as Electro, your opinions already don't matter. I have yet to hear one valid complaint about these two actors, & not ""oh he's too much of a douche & Twilight-y to be Peter"" or ""Jamie Foxx is a horrible actor, Electro isn't even black"". It's about character, not color, first of all. Tobey Maguire will always have a place in our hearts, but he's not coming back, & he can't, so get used to it! I've heard comments like this so much that I laugh at them now, you guys can continue your pointless bitching while us stronger fans support the hard work of a studio's movie.

Also, about the CGI, it's not even that bad. Obviously they're going to tweak it some more before the release, even the PS4 & Xbox One doesn't have graphics this good.¬†

So yeah, if you're gonna hate, then at least be original with your negative points. Good luck! :)",2013-12-06T03:40:34.000Z,6

Plus I also heard rumor that they're going to tie this storyline in with the Avengers and have Andrew Garfield as the amazing Spider-Man in The Avengers 2. It would also be cool if they could put Norman Osborn as Iron Patriot in one of the movies, but I don't think they will since they changed it up and made Rhodey the Iron Patriot in Iron Man 3.But maybe he could hijack The Armor in¬†a later movie or something. I doubt it will be Avengers 2 since the main villain in it is probably going to be Thanos, as seen at the end of Marvel's the Avengers, but maybe in Iron Man 4 or something, or possibly Avengers 3.

I can see him finding the venom serum. And using it due to him getting beaten by the three. ¬†

We got Electro(duh), Rhino, Vulture, Doc Ock, and Green Goblin. That's 5... We only need one more now. XD And the thing I love most that I can see from this trailer is, like Pacific Rim, It's very bright and vibrant!

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),never ever like orginal spider man series. Sami is the best director for spider man to justify the character of spider man . May Sony reboot or make the new one like ASM2 but best would be ever Sami spider man. May technology and visual effect improve in now a days but you can not make the test of original spider man. So my opinion for sony and marvel production please return Sami and original spider man so people can remember the movie in future .

Looks like  #theamazingspiderman  ¬†gets his own, trapdoor, ""Spider Burrow"" (Bat Cave), lol (1:07). (Anyone remember ""cellar door"" from the comics?) Also, we'll see Ma and Pa Parker's final flight (with an on-board fight as well? 1:42), rather than another Stacy death (too soon, IMO). Though I _am_ a bit concerned about what's going on at 2:04.

Can't wait to see who they cast as  #TheVulture  ,  #DocOck  , (1:15) and whoever might help Spidey in his upcoming battle (Black Cat?)

So far, except for the  #Greengoblin  costume (again?), and maybe even the mecha¬†  #Rhino  , I'm all aboard this one. Yeah, they could'a saved some of these reveals for the film, and could'a named the movie ""Spectacular"" or ""Peter Parker"", etc., but this trailer and movie looks amazing.

If this new franchise is closer to the comics then congrats to the director, but I've never really read the comics (except in the newspapers and I also have one book with Venom) and I have always favoured the Animated Series more.

B. But in the trailer there are Vulture's wings and Doc Ock's Tentacles and we can see Norman Osborn the Real Goblin is sick there.
C. Also, there is a spoiler in some web that the daily buggle news stated some bank has been robbed and attacked by shockwave beam that rattles and that must be The Shocker.
D. Dont forget The Lizard from TASM1 he is still alive in jail and the guy who visited him able to teleport like The Mysterio.
So, who are the villains will appear or some are cameos or just hinted in TASM2 :¬†

They show Dr. Octopus's arms and the Vultures wings, and they claim they can create more. Also, Rhino's suit looks mechanical so he could be a prototype to see if the mechanical arms and wings would work properly with a human host. In the first movie, we know Dr. Connors is hearing voices, so we can guess Mysterio is behind it. They would only need to bring in Sandman and Kraven (or the Hobgoblin?).

2013-12-05T13:26:27.000Z,nbp3Ra3Yp74,THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 - Official Trailer (HD),"Yes there are too many villains, but you guys have to realize that's how it was in the comics. In the comic books Spiderman would fight the Goblin in the morning and battle with Venom that same evening. If each movie only focused on one villain there would have to be over 8 films, not to mention all the actors/actresses aging. Then people would complain about THAT. THEN folks would complain that their favorite villain (or hero) didn't make it to the big screen!¬†

The bottom line is stop complaining and just wait and see! This might be good. The trailer looks amazing.",2013-12-05T14:18:06.000Z,2

I know the story and now they are changing it up again to rebrand a new Spider-Man but the are just retelling the same parts of the last Spider-Man story with a new backstory. I Just would have liked a new story without the evil Oscorp as one of the central bad guys AGAIN. I would have liked to see Kingpin as the central bad guy maybe.
