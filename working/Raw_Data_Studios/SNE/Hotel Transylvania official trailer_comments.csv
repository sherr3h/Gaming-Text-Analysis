The Boogie Man and Merlin were set to appear in Hotel Transylvania 2, but they were dropped out. All the new monsters but the Boogie Man and Merlin, which I mentioned in my comments so far, are not the only new monsters it featured. The film featured a number of other new monsters like the Invisible Man's girlfriend. The new monsters that Hotel Transylvania 2 featured did not include Godzilla or El Chupacabra. Godzilla & El Chupacabra had a slight chance of appearing in there but they didn't appear in there. No, they did not. I had hoped they would not forget to add Igor, Medusa, the Swamp Thing, King Kong, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the Phantom of the Opera, but the Phantom of the Opera was the only new monster out of those 6 monsters that appeared in the movie.

Quasimodo and Martha were set to appear in Hotel Transylvania 2, but they were dropped out. There are two reasons why Quasimodo did not appear in Hotel Transylvania 2. Because he never recovered from being frozen by Dracula in the first movie and because Dracula fired him. Opposed to appearing in the film, Martha was mentioned. All the monsters except for Quasimodo and Martha, which I mentioned in my comments so far, aren't the only monsters that appeared in this movie's sequel. Some of the other monsters appeared in the movie's sequel, too. As a matter of fact, Quasimodo and Martha aren't the only monsters that did not appear in the film's sequel.
