0.0006 the galaxy width.  In other words if you could shrink down the Milky Way down to just  the width of perhaps 5 miles which equates to  a walk of around ten thousand steps. Now begin walking and Stop after just 6 steps.....  Congratulations,You have now completed your journey. Yes that's how far they travelled from Earth to the other planet which took over a lifetime .So travelling 4 times around the earth per second (Remember SUPERMAN and LIGHT is twice as fast) It would take about  2,500 lifetimes to cross the Milky Way from end to end ...

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"Passengers, quite simply, shows us the difference between humans and robots. While the latter may lay claim to cognitive intelligence, they fall short and come nowhere close to our capacity for morality, empathy, love and the entire gamut of human emotions - some of our finest and worst qualities as humans; especially as regards decision making, which often have several different complicated layers other than the logical.

When Jim contemplates waking Aurora prematurely, it was borne of a selfish need for companionship, but which to Arthur, the android bartender, seemed only logical - a fitting solution to a pressing problem without the unnecessary handicap called morality.
Again, when Aurora falsely declares that there aren't any secrets between Jim and her, Arthur sees fit to correct that impression, not for the sake of right or wrong, but because of how illogical the claim was.

He's indifferent to how either feels. He is incapable of comprehending them, seeing events only through the narrow lens of logic. Whereas Gus, a human, could empathise with both of them - Jim, for the years of isolation he would have had to endure due to no fault of his, and Aurora, for her righteous anger at the one who decided her future without her consent.

The movie portrays in stark tones this messy business called humanity, all its strong points and imperfections. It doesn‚Äôt always make sense nor is it perfect despite the best intentions (Avalon's malfunction paints a ready picture). And perhaps, therein lies the answer - it's not meant to make sense nor be perfect, we are just to do our part, our share of good (hopefully not bad!) and move on.",2019-04-11T10:30:37.000Z,18

So im wondering
At the end of the movie they find out that the infirmary pod can also be used to put something in hibernation
Why dont they just switch places every year? If they sleep 40 yrs out of the 80, they will both be around 60 when they arrive. Of course they will still be alone... maybe spend 1 year alone, then 1 together. That will make them around 80 when they arrive. I mean, its possible isnt it?",2018-10-08T18:43:39.000Z,19

Like literally, this man has the fucking arrogance to ruin a woman's life just to mildly improve his own, even knowing acutely how awful the experience of waking up like that and having your life ripped away from you is. And she forgives him? Stockholm Syndrome. A complete and utter disregard for the right of a woman to her own life, she is just a tool of support for a man. This movie would have been good if when Jennifer Lawrence found out what an awful thing this guy did, she killed him and lived on the ship by herself, and proved that it was possible without destroying someone else. She could have written a lifetime's worth of novels, alone on that ship, and gone down in history as a lesson to men everywhere what happens when men think they have the right to control a woman.",2018-09-01T14:59:56.000Z,6

Let's stop using Titanic for every romance between a male and a female on movies, anymore. Lastly, the trailers gives too much vibes from Mass Effect, and specifically with Mass Effect : Andromeda, and that only about the cryoponds,  but to my humble opinion, it is even more dark and serious than the game and with a totally different theme in the story line plus, a romance/friendly/platonic? relationship between the two. I am very much intrigued to watch the movie now, I was really interested to see another movie/play another video game with space and survival. - Dead Space was good too.

HEHE‚Ä¶ so they left earth for like a start over with life. they were supposed to hibernate like bears for 120. but Jim Preston woke up early in 30 years of the trip. he can't go back to hibernate, he saw a girl sleeping in a pod, fell in love with her, and like messed up the pod to wake her up. soon, they fall in love‚Ä¶ blah,blah,blah. jim woke up because a big asteroid that slammed against the ship. one of the crew members woke up early, tried to fix the problems with the ship‚Ä¶. and died later. the ship was like broken, and a fire-thing hit the ship and jammed the door (which will make the ship to blow and kill about 5,000 people that were hibernating.) so jim went out in space unjammed the door, and his safety cord (which helps you not get separated from the ship, so you won't wander in space and die) he almost died, but saved the 5,000 people. they basically lost their lives because you can't go bake to hibernate and they were like 20. staying alive for 88 more years‚Ä¶ you would probably die of old age. they died of old age LOL. the girl made a story on the computer. 88 years later, the crew members wake up and heard the story with the 3 people and the ship‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"Kind of disappointed after watching this film. Another movie that didn't know what genre it wanted to be. Did it want to be a tragic romance? A space thriller? Cast Away in space? It tried to be all three but it didn't blend the elements of any of them very well and in the end the movie had no guts to do something a little different. It could have been good, it really wanted to be the problem has everything to do with the writing and maybe a little directing. SPOILERS AHEAD They wrote themselves into a WTF Problem by saying the pods never malfunction, ever. The titanic conundrum. They make it sound like spare parts would really help them out and that's all it is. BUT they briefly mention how when they were put to sleep it they were in a facility and it sounded very controlled and technical. Something their Pods couldn't do. But instead of that being the focus of the problem it's just ""It doesn't break so don't bother with spare parts"". If they wanted it to be more of a space thriller they should've started the story with Aurora waking up and we the audience only know what she knows. Just that he was alone for a year and her pod malfunctioned. It would've been a lot creepier and focused on the emotional development of Aurora being trapped on a ship with a man that essentially hid the truth to develop a romantic relationship with her. After she found out they could've focused on her coming to terms with their situation and sympathizing with Jim as she learns how he felt being so alone. Later in the story instead of Jim just finally figuring out a solution so he can begin to fix problems they just write another character into the story holding a skeleton key and really contributes little to the narrative other than ""Oh yeah remember the ship is malfunctioning? Here's what you have to do and I died with only 10 minutes on screen and you're supposed to feel bad for me because I had a lot of health problems.""
Even though there are a few scatterings of minor malfunctions with the ship they kind of just ignore it. Until the problem gets severe. Even then they waste time to save an Android instead of using that time to save the ship.
 There's no creepy atmosphere there's no real feeling of these characters feeling alone it's kinda written as boredom rather than complete loneliness. This movie has no guts to end Jim so Aurora can further understand his complete loneliness while also learning from it. 

Nope it's just 116 minutes of different genres slapped onto pages with little tendrils trying to tie them together in ways that really don't work. If you know where to look you'll find the seams.",2017-05-12T17:20:52.000Z,6

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"A review of this movie from someone who really enjoyed it:

If you understood how theoretical space travel works, then it will be 
far more amazing and you would respect it a lot more. Many things shown 
in this movie made me wonder if there would be a better alternative for a
 certain function, but the more I look into it, the more things made 
sense. The scientific aspects of this movie are amazing and more 
accurate than I expected. The low gravity interactions with objects are 
well choreographed. The artificial gravity created by the spinning 
sectors of the ship are theoretically accurate as well.

<Spoiler Alert>
Amazing
 movie, but it does have its flaws. Jim could have easily opened 
everyone's hibernation pods, just as he opened Aurora's. Then, he could 
have more company and Aurora wouldn't hate him as much. Also, at the end
 of the movie, it would have been better to see Jim and Aurora's 
children or grandchildren welcoming everyone who just woke up and I was 
anticipating that. This trailer is rather misleading in making you think
 that alien interaction was involved, but none were. It wasn't as 
amazing as I had hoped, yet it was better than I expected.

For me they seriously need to start a more minimalist approach to trailers, just enough to whet, not enough to drown. The first 90% of this movie is brilliant, unique and actually really well acted and I tip my hat to the producer to finally put this script on film. The last 10% which was a rewrite on the original, Hollywooded the f__k out of it and left me feeling like I'd just been licked clean by a thousand kittens not to mention completely wasting on an opportunity to capitilise on the twists that had been developing throughout. 9/10 first 90%, 1/10 last 10%, 8.2/10.",2017-04-28T15:17:04.000Z,0

The trailer says at the end, ""There's a reason we woke up early."" From this point on, I was expecting the android to be that reason, to be a twist in the plot since the android was there and active when Jim woke up first. What a bummer that the rest of the movie played out as nothing more than a romance and the cause of Jim waking up was simple malfunction due to¬†holes in the ship from meteor strikes.

Here i am with a state of the art gigantic tv and all modern cinema can offer is a bunch of cheap predictable guff. Vastly prefer watching ""Five Easy Pieces"" on my old black and white 20inch screen. And i'm not that old at 33. Not comparable films i realise, but if we're talking Sci Fi the original ""alien "" or first Star Wars wipes the floor with this crud. More contemporaneously why didnt they spend all that time and money adapting the book ""Children of Time"" into a film instead of this fairly obvious boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back set against a space/ tech backdrop. Even Children of Time is a pretty average scifi story, but it beats the living daylights out of Passengers. Two hours of my life  i'll never get back.

So they built this entire ship, with all of this space and amenities... for 4 months out of a 120 year voyage? Why not keep everyone but a small crew in stasis for the duration, and wake them up upon landing? You could ship all those people out in a giant space-truck.",2017-03-30T19:43:35.000Z,4

But just ask yourself these questions. How often do have to replace a light bulb/How long do LEDs last? How long would it take to polish a hole in a glass with a rag? How long does it take the moisture in the air to rust metal?

When the guy was fixing the ship he could have found a way to reactivate the hibernation sleep system so that he and his girl should have gone back and sleep again and then waking up when the ship was closing to homestead II and then from there a new story should have begun. The movie ended too quick.  If they returned back to sleep then it would have been possible to make a sequel. The good news is that the movie was very good but the bad news is that the movie ended too soon and should have progressed to at least 5 more movie sequels.

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"A lot of reviewers calling this film a creepy stalker movie and Chris Pratt's character 'morally bankrupt' for condemning another passenger to ' a very slow death sentence', as if they wouldn't wake someone else up if faced with living their whole life alone!¬†It's not a death sentence, it's life on a luxury space ship with free gourmet food, free instant health care, free luxury accommodations on a spaceship travelling through space with a panoramic space-view swimming pool !! I mean, fair enough it does put her in a position of possibly being stuck alone with a guy she might not like, and who probably wants to sleep with her but as it turns out she really is attracted to him., His despair and loneliness is completely understandable and her shock and anger at finding out he lied to her is too. Leaving aside the question of why a ship with 5000 passengers has only one med bay, when Jennifer Lawrence's character is offered the chance to go back to sleep she realises that the adventure she had planned, leaving her friends behind to write the ultimate time travelling story, was an empty attempt to live up to her father's legacy and unlikely to bring her any happiness.Having been faced with the terrifying prospect of being alone herself for the rest of her life if Chris Pratt's character died, she has an insight into what drove him to wake her and is able to forgive him.

Also , if he was going to wake someone because he was desperate then shouldn't it have been some ship engineers that probably could have developed a solution to the malfunctioning life pod. I think he was thinking with his litter head instead of his big head. By the way,  how the hell did he become so technically smart during the ship crisis ??

He was a poor sociological and psychological candidate for such an important mission.  Only a year alone and he was already  contemplating suicide as a solution to his problem , and  when he chicken out on suicide he decides to doom another to his fate like a coward selfish piece of excrement. I gather they didn't screen the mission candidates .

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"Maybe I have an unpopular opinion on this movie... but it was very forgettable. My anticipation for this movie was high: the concept seemed very cool. What we got is the most boring generic good guy. He has absolutely zero character to him. He and the girl are both good looking and there's been put a lot of effort in the CGI fest that this movie is. But the love story is so generic as well, I quit watching this movie when I wasn't even halfway through. 
About the technology and physics this movie seems entirely impossible. I get that it's set in the future, but nothing about the technologies seemed probable, next to that the physics in this movie seemed completely inaccurate. Take for example the seen that the ship's gravitational systems have a failure. The Aurora swims in the pool and the water starts floating in a bubble. Not only is the CGI horrible, I'm pretty certain water wouldn't behave in that way. The movie just doesn't hold my attention because I feel not a single click with the characters and it kills it for me...",2017-03-02T21:22:01.000Z,3

This movie's ending was god-awful! After they went through all that, they're not smart enough to figure it out?!? The Autodoc can suspend someone back to sleep (""hibernation"") so that someone can live to see homestead 2 and not die on the ship. The only problem is that there is only one Autodoc. This is all given information at the end of the movie.

HOWEVER. If they were smart, they could space it out. Space out the time. One person can be in hibernation for 40 years, then they will be woken up by the other person and trade off. Aurora can go into hibernation first for 40 years, then Jim wakes her up and then goes into hibernation himself.

First of all, the sleep pods NEVER fail, so that means it is meant for someone to use once they land on Homestead 2. The problem is, it takes 120 years to get there and the phone call would take 60 years (they are traveling at half light speed).

I thought this was such a PROFOUND film but people just cant grasp it. It tackles a unique issue with moral dilemmas, never experienced in human history.

*spoiler alert* ""Stranded films have been made before"" but not with this kind of depressing outlook, Jim was not expected to die, he had food and shelter, which emphasized his feelings of loneliness. ""People have been stranded before, Jim was just selfish"" No one has ever had the option Jim had. I'd say it was an irresistible temptation. People just fail to understand what Jim went through. Do you know how lonely is it to not have friends? Imagine that but have no anyone until you die, not even acquaintances or enemies.",2017-01-14T01:55:10.000Z,9

I mean he's charismatic and he's great with JLaw, but what he did is a kind of... evil. And the film try to convince us really hard that it was a difficult decision and he had to do it, but come on, it was egocentric. 
The photography and camerawork is pleasant; I really liked the scene involving the lack of gravity; 2/3 of the film is good, you can have some fun, but the final... is predictable and in an attempt to be grandiose, it become corny. A bombastic final which will probably convince many people that was an awesome film without mistakes.

It's still really good, but a lot different than you expect. It's really heavy on the romance, more so than expected. I kinda wish there was some conspiracy reason they woke earlier other than Pod Failure, but there isn't.

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"Guys I'm going to be honest I LOVE the movie in terms of visual effects, the story is interesting, but for the same thing that I liked a lot the information they gave was very superficial, I would have liked them to give more ... if you too leave you with many gaps, leave your questions here and between all of us try to solve them ... if they did not give us enough information, we try to fill them with our theories and I will leave some doubts here ...

1. In the movie let us know that the ship is in ""automatic"" form so from there you stay that ""Irresponsible"", however advanced the technology could be made by humans so it is exposed to have failures , What I would have thought to myself is that for example the first 20 years were piloted or supervised by crew members, after 20 years these people were put in capsules to hibernate and woke up new people from the crew previously trained to do The same (so did not die in the ship and all workers would come alive to the new planet, clear 20 years older).

2. There were only 5000 passengers, so I think it was a limited number so the selection of people to travel would have liked more information about how the election process was, what were the requirements etc ... The character of Chris made it ""discount"" because he was going to render his services on the other planet so we can think that it was like barter type, we give you a place and you give us your job in the future. Aurora had the neatness of the Gold Class so they let us think she has a lot of money to afford her own trip.

3. I read in several forums that said that Chris's character had hired him to render his services in the new world but that would be kind of stupid because the knowledge he had would be 120 years old when he arrived ... But to this I I say no, if we consider that it is a new world where they are going to start from 0 to say type when the man lived in the caves but he was going to have many years of knowledge, do not they?

4. I have a Theory: That the Character of Chris woke up was not a mistake, the ship knew that  had a problem so decided to wake up someone who knew how repair it, an Engineer but with this doubt my theory is coming a bit down ... If the technology was intelligent enough to wake up someone to repair it, would not it have been better to wake up instead of a passenger to one of the crew? The only thing that would support my theory is that the crew knew how to detect the problem and not fix it and that's where the knowledge of Chris's character would come in!

As I said it is a movie that I call quite the attention and I would like to see what opinions, doubts or questions have about it, greetings People = D",2016-12-30T09:56:33.000Z,6

Everyone says the trailer doesn't match the movie because they left out that he woke up aurora, the trailer is supposed to leave things out, ITS THE FRICKING TRAILER. It's not like they are going to explain the whole movie in the trailer and say every detail. I think this movie was great. Most people think OMG ITS HORRIBLE THAT HE WOKE HER UP. Really? It was a year until he woke her up, he was about to kill himself and he knew it was wrong to wake her up, and he tried to stop himself but he woke her up and It's part of the movie so if you don't like that he woke up then you obviously don't like the movie.

The film is just great and imagine this comes from someone who doesn't like SciFi films. It's the first time I really enjoy an outer space film and a spacecraft(Avalon) and, as for a spicy detail, it's the first time in my life that I ever see two consecutive sex(love) scenes in a top Hollywood production.
 The actors performed just GREAT, Jennifer Lawrence is sublime, Laurence Fishburne brings his personal touch to the film, but Andy Garcia could have had a better role.

 In conclusion, this film is so good that I would buy another tiket for tomorrow. Trust my words: Go See It!

The male character, well, both characters, are complete morons, but that is males in most modern movies.
Pratt plays the most codependent male that I think I've ever seen, and for a ""mechanic"", he is not very mechanically inclined.   I must admit, tho, most mechanics become mechanics not due to aptitude, but due to ease of entry into he field.  
Really, he couldn't even handle a year alone?   Christ, guys go out into the wilderness and some spend _decades_ alone to get away from people's bullshit. 
And fat Morpheus is a dipshit too.   He plays a character competent enough that he should have known that he had to wake up a qualified crew member or two to fix the problem.  His character could tell right away that these two passengers were morons.",2016-12-29T11:20:29.000Z,1

I absolutely loved it, even if there's only 3 people (2 for 90% of the movie), and one android, it held my attention from very first second until the end, and I wanted more. I was unsatisfied when it ended. One of my favorite movies! Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence had a great chemistry together. The pool scene when the Avalon lost gravity is absolutely stunning!

Chris & Jennifer had great chemistry that's for sure. Never imagined them doing a movie together. They did most of the acting in this film. Michael who played Arthur also did a great job in this film. When there's only 2 humans in 90% of the film and still makes you interested is impressive. The pool scene was unique. Interesting concept/plot. I honestly wanted to know what happened 90 years later when arriving on Homestead ll but it's ok, at least we got to know a great story. Makes you wonder would you wake someone else up just so you wouldn't be alone and feel guilt for maybe ruining their life and they will never to get to start over on a new planet?

If you want to want to see a sci fi isolationist mystery movie, this is not for you. If you want to see a formulaic love story movie with good effects, see this movie. The ""mystery"" of why they woke up is explained in the first 10 minutes of the movie. The rest is a bland and formulaic love story. When I say you know the entire plot within 10 minutes, I am not kidding. Music is good, acting is good, visuals are great but feel pushed to the side too often. The cinematography, for the most part, is bland and typical. Don't go in expecting anything great.",2016-12-26T20:20:53.000Z,3

JLaw and Chris fans will not be dissapointed, guarantee 100%. There were few moments in film that I consider to be unrealistic but anyway I liked it a lot. Jokes in film are good, people in cinema laughed and enjoyed them (good jokes are rare in movies for the recent time).
Of course, film does not to pretend on deep philosophy (do not expect Gravity or Interstellar here...), but it raises some interesting feelings and thoughts inside me. This film is very light-weighted and pleasant, just relax and enjoy your favorite actors.
I'm thinking of visiting the cinema again. I'm very glad that Jen and Chris did a good movie.",2016-12-22T20:56:41.000Z,0

As an example, that shot of Andy Garcia is spliced in with the shot of Laurence Fishburne, but those 2 never share the screen, and Garcia appears for 5 seconds at the end with no lines (Thanks for ruining that and making it look like he had role to play).

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"I hate that the trailer is so misleading. This movie isn't  a romance. Nor is it an adventure movie. Listen, the guy wakes up years ahead of schedule, and then with nothing to do, he walks around and stumbles upon a pod with the Jennifer Lawtrence character in it. Thinking she was hot, she started to stalk her on the internet, and like tracking her entire life watching all her videos and articles. He then wakes Aurora up, effectively forcing her to live out her life with him.  And then didn't tell her that part and so she didn't know, and after a while she sleeps with him. I kept waiting for the part where he realises he's actually the antagonist instead of the protoganist but no. After she finds out about the dude after months of him cyber stalking her and then ripping her out of er life to force her to live the rest of her life solely with him, she starts running like hell.She's literally running from him but she can't escape. So he chased her down. And because he didn't respect the need for space that she needed after finding out what he did, he broadcasts his 'apology' over like the speaker thing and his apology was something like: what i did was wrong, but you are so beautiful, can you really blame me? I thought that this was all going to lead to the film using his actions to discuss Jim‚Äôs sense of entitlement and his violation of Aurora. But no. And plus, Aurora is constantly sexualised, and is always in some bikini or something sexy for the camera to leer at. Jim though, is never ogled. Instead, his nudity is presented as a joke. She‚Äôs ever-ready for sex, doesn‚Äôt own sweatpants, and is smart and funny, but not so smart or so funny that Jim feels threatened by her. When it comes to fixing stuff, she‚Äôs so clueless her only job is holding the flashlight. Even her rage over Jim‚Äôs betrayal feels part of his fantasy. His guilt demands to be assuaged, so she has to be angry at him, but not for too long. After all, they still have space banging to do.",2016-12-21T12:39:07.000Z,25

releasing this on Dec. 21st, while Rogue One is the huge event-movie of 
the holidays was a terrible decision on the studio's part. 
 
Everytime something like this happens, it results in low performance at the 
box office,and a genre film basically gets mostly ignored by the 
majority of movie goers when there's a huge event movie already out. 

 This movie should of been released in January or March when it didn't 
have heavy competition from a major sci-fi event movie like Rogue One

Though now, that've seen the recap, it doesn't seem like a great movie. A chill one maybe.

Thx

I'll just say that when it comes to white lead actresses I would much rather see Alicia Vikander, Margot Robbie, Emma Stone or Brie Larson as alternative white lead actress options to the unbearably annoying Jennifer Lawrence. I agree with a lot of the comments here that are saying Hollywood needs to stop pushing her... there are way better options out their. But on another note u couldve made the leads an interracial couple... so at least big budget films could finally stop having a diverse SIDE cast with white STARRING actors.

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"Neisseria meningitidis, often referred to as meningococcus, is a gram negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx.[1] As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic and endemic form.[2] N. meningitidis is spread through saliva and respiratory secretions during coughing, sneezing, kissing, and chewing on toys. It infects the cell by sticking to it with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc and has several virulence factors. Meningococcus can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease.[3] It initially produces general symptoms like fatigue, fever, and headache and can rapidly progress to neck stiffness, coma and death in 10% of cases. Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae.[4][5] Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom is that if a case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital.[6] This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is based on the idea that the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death. Septicaemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis has received much less public attention than meningococcal meningitis even though septicaemia has been linked to infant deaths.[7] Meningococcal septicaemia typically causes a purpuric rash, that does not lose its color when pressed with a glass (""non-blanching"") and does not cause the classical symptoms of meningitis. This means the condition may be ignored by those not aware of the significance of the rash. Septicaemia carries an approximate 50% mortality rate over a few hours from initial onset. Other severe complications include Waterhouse‚ÄìFriderichsen syndrome, a massive, usually bilateral, hemorrhage into the adrenal glands caused by fulminant meningococcemia, adrenal insufficiency, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.[5] Not all instances of a purpura-like rash are due to meningococcal septicaemia; other possible causes, such as Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; a platelet disorder) and Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura, also need prompt investigation. N. meningitidis is a Gram-negative bacterium since it has an outer and inner membranes with a thin layer of peptidoglycan in between. It tests positive for the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase.[8] Habitat[edit] N. meningitidis is a part of the normal nonpathogenic flora in the nasopharynx of up to 5‚Äì15% of adults.[9] It colonizes and infects only humans, and has never been isolated from other animals. This is thought to stem from the bacterium's inability to get iron other than from the human sources transferrin and lactoferrin.[4] Subtypes[edit] Disease-causing strains are classified according to the antigenic structure of their polysaccharide capsule.[10] Serotype distribution varies markedly around the world.[11] Among the 13 identified capsular types of N. meningitidis, six (A, B, C, W135, X, and Y) account for most disease cases worldwide.[12] Type A has been the most prevalent in Africa and Asia, but is rare/ practically absent in North America. In the United States, serogroup B is the predominant cause of disease and mortality, followed by serogroup C. The multiple subtypes have hindered development of a universal vaccine for meningococcal disease. Virulence[edit] Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the outer membrane of N. meningitidis. This acts as an endotoxin and is responsible for septic shock and hemorrhage due to the destruction of red blood cells.[13] Other virulence factors include a polysaccharide capsule which prevents host phagocytosis and aids in evasion of the host immune response; fimbriae mediate attachment of the bacterium to the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx.[14][15] It infects the cell by sticking to it mainly with long thin extensions called pili and the surface-exposed proteins Opa and Opc.[16] Meningococci produce an IgA protease, an enzyme that cleaves IgA class antibodies and thus allows the bacteria to evade a subclass of the humoral immune system. A hypervirulent strain was discovered in China. Its impact is yet to be determined.[5] At least 8 complete genomes of Neisseria meningitidis strains have been determined which encode about 2,100 to 2,500 proteins.[17] The genome of strain MC58 (serogroup B) has 2,272,351-base pairs. When sequenced in 2000, it was found to contain 2158 open reading frames (ORFs). Of these, a biological function was identified for 1158 (53.7%). There were three major islands of horizontal DNA transfer found. Two encode proteins involved in pathogenicity. The third island only codes for hypothetical proteins. They also found more genes that undergo phase variation than any pathogen then known. Phase variation is a mechanism that helps the pathogen to evade the immune system of the host.[18] The genome size of strain H44/76 is 2.18 Mb, and encodes 2,480 open reading frames (ORFs), compared to 2.27 Mb and 2,465 ORFs for MC58.[17] Both strains have a GC content of 51.5%.[17] A comparison with MC58 showed that four genes are uniquely present in H44/76 and nine genes are only present in MC58. Of all ORFs in H44/76, 2,317 (93%) show more than 99% sequence identity.[17] The complete genome sequence of strain NMA510612 (serogroup A) consists of one circular chromosome with a size of 2,188,020 bp, and the average GC content is 51.5%. The chromosome is predicted to possess 4 rRNA operons, 163 insertion elements (IS), 59 tRNAs, and 2,462 ORFs.[19] Genetic transformation is the process by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient‚Äôs genome by recombination. In N. meningitidis, DNA transformation requires the presence of short DNA sequences (9‚Äì10 mers residing in coding regions) of the donor DNA. These sequences are called DNA uptake sequences (DUSs). Specific recognition of these sequences is mediated by a type IV pilin.[20] In N. meningitidis DUSs occur at a significantly higher density in genes involved in DNA repair and recombination (as well as in restriction-modification and replication) than in other annotated gene groups. The over-representation of DUS in DNA repair and recombination genes may reflect the benefit of maintaining the integrity of the DNA repair and recombination machinery by preferentially taking up genome maintenance genes, that could replace their damaged counterparts in the recipient cell.[21] N. meningititis colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is rich in macrophages. Upon their activation, macrophages produce superoxide (O2¬Ø) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Thus N. meningitidis is likely to encounter oxidative stress during its life cycle.[22] Consequently, an important benefit of genetic transformation to N. meningitidis may be the maintenance of the recombination and repair machinery of the cell that removes oxidative DNA damages such as those caused by reactive oxygen. This is consistent with the more general idea that transformation benefits bacterial pathogens by facilitating repair of DNA damages produced by the oxidative defenses of the host during infection.[23] With a fatality risk approaching 15% within 12 hours of infection, it is crucial to initiate testing as quickly as possible, but not to wait for the results before initiating antibiotic therapy. A small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is sent to the laboratory as soon as possible for analysis. The diagnosis is suspected, when gram negative diplococci are seen on Gram stain of a centrifuged sample of CSF; sometimes they are located inside white blood cells. The microscopic identification takes around 1‚Äì2 hours after specimen arrival in the laboratory.[3] The gold standard of diagnosis is microbiological isolation of N. meningitidis by growth from a sterile body fluid, which could be CSF or blood.[5] Diagnosis is confirmed when the organism has grown, most often on a chocolate agar plate, but also on Thayer-Martin agar. To differentiate any bacterial growth from other species a small amount of a bacterial colony is tested for oxidase, catalase for which all clinically relevant Neisseria show a positive reaction, and the carbohydrates maltose, sucrose, and glucose, in which N. meningitidis will ferment that",2016-09-30T07:49:32.000Z,2

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"This movie is giving us the experience of a man alone in space trying to figure out a way to survive like in THE MARTIAN, without knowing that it was a plan made from the beginning like in INTERSTELLAR, where he will find his Counterpart, that they are going to figure the mission out like in EUROPA REPORT, to repair the spaceship from outside with some nightmare sequences like in GRAVITY, contemplating the  beauty of the interstellar space like in EVENT HORIZON, they are going to question their own existence and creation like in PROMETHEUS, resulting in that they may be I ROBOT. They will have to make  heavy sacrifices for the remaining ""real"" Humans like in SUNSHINE, this action movie will lead  the protagonist to explore stars like in SOLARIS, to prepare for crash like in MOON. Are they going to encounter ALIEN? Is there going to be an happy ending like in PANDORUM?

9-13-16
Yes, he's a bit of an egomaniac; but I don't care. The country is a mess because politicians suck. The Republican Party is two-faced and gutless, and illegals are everywhere. I want it all fixed!

I don't care that Trump is crude. I don't care that he insults people. I don't care that he has changed positions. I don't care that he's been married 3 times.
I don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly and Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell. I don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslin terrorist. I don't care if the guy has bad hair.

Our country has become weak, bankrupt. Our enemies are making fun of us. We are being invaded by illegals.

We are becoming a nation of victims where every Tom, Ricardo, and Hassid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in.

""I JUST WANT IT FIXED.""
And Trump is the only guy who seems to understand what the PEOPLE want.

I'm sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and sick of illegals. I just want this thing fixed.¬†

Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money controlling him; he doesn't have political correctness restraining him; all you know is that he has been very successful; a good negotiator; he has built a lot of things; and, he's also not a politician.¬†

He says he'll fix it. And, I believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar.

You are welcome to pass this on, or not.",2016-09-22T02:22:47.000Z,4

If you saw a trailer that was ten seconds long, black screen, white text, movie title, date of release, movie genre, and maybe some music that ties in to the story symbolically, would you go watch it in the theaters?

In my opinion, a movie with a trailer that ominous might have a rather alluring appeal, sort of making you wonder: ""What's behind the curtain?""

Plot:


A group of people has gotten a mission to get to a universe, they get put to sleep in freezing bags so they cant grow old and die because the trip will take alot of years.

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"I really don't know why people are saying that they've included the 'whole film in the trailer' and that they've 'spoilt' it. I can tell you, I've read Jon Spaihts' (amazing) script and the trailer doesn't spoil anything. I was surprised of a few things that happened in the script and none of those surprises are in this trailer. This trailer simply shows you that two people have woken up on a spaceship and they soon fall in love. Sure, there's going to be action, it's set in space, it'd be really boring if it just focused on Jennifer and Chris' characters. 
Can't we just be happy that, in the midst of all the remakes & sequels we've had this year (far too many to count), we're getting a film that is fresh and original. It's not like Wall-E, it's not like 'Titanic in space' and it's not like Gravity. Just because they feature romance and it's a sci-fi doesn't mean it's going to be unlike any other film we've already seen. 
Who cares if you don't like Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Pratt? In my opinion, I find Pratt to be annoying but that won't stop me watching this film as I've been looking forward to it for the past year. 
See the film, don't see the film, it's up to you. Please don't moan that it's spoilt everything because it hasn't, I promise you. It's impossible to include the whole film (90-120mins long) in 2min26sec long trailer. Be realistic.",2016-09-21T12:34:06.000Z,9

The guy who wrote it is same guy who wrote Prometheus. When asked what is the best example of a script written, Joel, the manager, mentioned this script titled Passengers, which was being shuffled around Hollywood and had a hard time getting made. I read the script multiple times and indeed it was very visual and well written. It was very clear why the movie didn't get made. The ending was not the strong point of the story. Then I heard this thing got into production with name actors. Seeing the trailer, it seems the script's second half has been heavily altered.

Simply by the look.¬†What I'm sayin is I disike that it lacks true grit, I guess. It looks like the characters are in a five star hotel and not a space-ship.

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"As our system of things continues the downward spiral towards its eventual end, this type of entertainment is going to become more and more prevalent. Why? 

(1 John 5:19) We (as in humanity) know that we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.

(2 Corinthians 4:4) among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers

(John 14:30) I will not speak with you much more, for the ruler of the world is coming, and he has no hold on me.

The world is quite literally under Satanic influence (Revelation 12:9) and as a direct result, his spirit feeds this world. It is a blanket that covers the earth and affects every living human. This power and control give Satan and his followers (demons) a significant amount of fearlessness. However, the one thing they fear is the one thing they cannot control: their eventual deaths (Revelation 20:10). At this moment, Satan and his followers are imprisoned in a cell called earth (Revelation 12:7-12). Their impending death sentence provides them with so much fear that this fear is manifested in the form of films, books, video games, and so much more with one unified message: ""LEAVE THE EARTH."" 

They cannot leave the earth, and neither will we... for now.",2016-09-21T03:50:27.000Z,1

2016-09-20T10:00:06.000Z,7BWWWQzTpNU,PASSENGERS - Official Trailer (HD),"While I don't understand why distributors can't take the time to upload multiple versions of a trailer to different social media platforms, I thought I'd clarify WHY there is a brief five second ""teaser"" before the actual trailer. This is done because on sites like Facebook or Twitter, an ""auto-play"" function is typically the default video playback option. So the studio's thinking here is that they have five seconds to summarize the trailer so that someone scrolling past the video will have their interest caught more efficiently than perhaps seeing an establishing shot, etc. It's a more recent marketing tactic, but it's definitely becoming prevalent. Like I said, I don't understand why the studios don't just take the time to upload a version of the trailer with the extra preview at the beginning specifically to sites like Facebook and Twitter, and then leave the original version to sites such as YouTube. I guess, like I said earlier, it's just to ensure that even if someone shares the video from YouTube on Facebook, they can captivate as wide an audience as possible. Of course, this leads me to question if studios will begin shortening trailers as a whole. You know, rather than spoiling the whole movie in two and a half minutes. The movie trailer industry is great at what it does, but I feel like we need a huge overhaul in regards to the way we go about marketing films these days. Almost every trailer is structured the same, and too many of them continue to spoil plot points or surprising scenes that would've been better seen only at the theater. My suggestion is that, rather than trying to summarize the plot of the film, trailer companies begin to market the aesthetic and tone of the film. Perhaps through showing a snippet of a dialogue scene, and then showing a brief montage of interesting scenes from the film without any actual context.",2016-09-20T14:21:45.000Z,0

Quando se trata de explorar o universos e os seus mist√©rios h√° um potencial enorme de causar suspenses e ansiedade pelo desconhecido, ainda mais quando h√° esse casal sozinho em territ√≥rio hostil! E eu apoio muito esta iniciativa de incluir cada vez mais essa tem√°tica nas telas, desde Interestellar vimos como o filme foi capaz de influenciar gera√ß√µes diferentes e ser refer√™ncia para os pr√≥ximos que vir√£o. Por√©m o trailer basicamente j√° mostra uma hist√≥ria e n√£o a pr√©via como deveria ser... Espero que realmente tenhamos muitas surpresas e que esse filme consiga competir com o Rogue One! :)",2016-09-20T13:43:25.000Z,3
