2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),Honestly they ruined this movie beyond belief. It‚Äôs almost as if the writers have never cared to pick up any of these books. The dark tower is a fantastic story and what a shame it was to witness such a masterpiece hastily disgraced once it finally had its chance at the big screen and to see Roland so degraded in every aspect to his character was shameful. I mean they could have at least taken the fingers off his right hand.,2018-10-12T21:24:59.000Z,15

Also i've watched it after Infinity War, so it helped remove the taste of garbage and give me hope that good movies aren't dead...yet.
Also, i never liked SK writting, but after this i went and got myself the 9 books, the 2 companion books and all the comics (the 15 runs... i don't think there are more). 10/10 ... amazing movie and even more amazing for opening my eyes to a universe that i didn't even knew it existed.

If you want some great movie, this is not it. Story is interesting and they used good actors, but movie is too short to fully connect to the actors and the story itself. There is no twists and turns in movie and i think that would benefit a lot in movie. Also, you dont learn about most stuff in movie, they are thrown at you and i think for this kind of movie, that is required. In nutshell, more background is needed. Havent read the book, but it looks to me that this is really disappointment for the book.... My rating is 6/10 for interesting story but bad ''delivery'' of it",2018-03-23T02:47:25.000Z,3

Is this movie a ""funny"" movie, like ""BLACKULA""?

If not, I demand in this political correctness fury a WHITE actored Kunta Kinte movie adaption, BECAUSE if we are counting the whole history, in all races were slaves, blacks hunted and sold their own people, rich american jews didn¬¥t help their brothers and sisters during the second war, because their were ashamed by their orthodox, poor eastern folk (just a sample: Jews 1939 St.Louis - ""White House had decided not to take extraordinary measures to permit the refugees to enter the United States"", just a fist full of people...), they even financed hitler.

Don't get me wrong, there are issues with the movie, nevertheless it has its moments particularly well choreographed action, scenery is gorgeous and lead stars bring their A game although the script is very cookie cutter generic sci Fi material, but you can give it a pass. Unfortunately it felt like it needed an extra 40 to 50 minutes to fully explain the mythology and provide more satisfying experience of the big screen adaption. It is a rainy night type of movie and you are not missing out if you don't ever see it so make your own judgement .2.5/5",2017-11-30T12:59:54.000Z,7

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),Dreams.. rapidly running out of ideas....I have been waiting to enjoy movies again. Sad for me. Movies.. huhhh.. this made me smile tho... Silly concept ending the trailer however.. one only heals with the heart. So its giggle worthy.. but I think the sensationalism is why I am so prone to films aimed now at an older audience. But I live in hope for somthing magical for the world..so we can keep dreaming. If we are living a nightmare art reflects that nightmare. We all know a change is comming. Where indeed to go for inspiration? Films are just way too rushed and artists and actors are way too traumatized to slip into their roles. Maybe people within the entertainment machine should reach individually to inspire once again.. thats where the magic is. Its all so dissapointing. Blessed~,2017-09-23T22:42:07.000Z,4

I saw this with my friend today, she's easily entertained so she liked it. But I expected better, I would see ads for this movie and thought it looked like some badass action movie, there was only 3 action scenes, and only one of them was actually cool. And when Rowland (The Gunslinger) fights The Man In Black it reminded me of a low budget fanmade film that was uploaded to YouTube by college kids.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"This movie is horrible. 300millions$ for 90minutes adapted from a 3K pages book ...
Music is horrible - where is Hans Zimmer when we need him the most ?
Realisator is seriously noob, so is the scenario. How can you wrote a scenario so shitty from this awesome and huge universe, even HarryPotter managed to make ecent movies from a childdish book serie with zero background WTH.
And what about CGIs ?
Like WTF where did those 300millions went to ??

On a better note : Roland's fighting scenes fit pretty decently with his supernatural abilities from the books... (would be better with CGIs from 21th century blockbusters, not this kind of 80's low budget after effects -_- [yeah Matthew your spells are seriously horrible and make me vomit])

But hey, i still kinda cried when Roland said the famous sentences ... especially at the "" ... i kill with my heart!"" ... waited for this for like 10 years ? more ?
Talkin about famous sentences from the book, this movie should've started with the poem quote ... ""Roland went to the dark tower etc..."" (english isn't my mother tongue so dunno how to translate it sorry pals)

Very disapointed but also wanting to watch it again everyday till the blueray comes out (so many delted scenes !!!! you all can see that many scenes from the trailer aren't in the fial version, watch it again if you don't trust me, may be like 20 more minutes i hope.

Also, Matthew is so fukin under-used -_- and non-original version are HORRIBLE (the ""all your friends DIED by MY hands"" sounds awefull in every other versions -_- D': )
Still ""glad"" they"" corrected the ""knight"" in final version ... they aren't knights wtf did you even read the book before starting to plan makin money wasting a fukin awesome and major piece of art of 20th century fantasy book ???

Regards,
a butt-hurt Stephen King young fan ^^

Not sure who else could've pulled it off to that degree. Sam Jackson gettin too old, Tom cruise just doesn't work in these types of films, Bruce willis' ""always confused"" look wouldve been stale after the 2nd fight scene, vin diesel would've made it feel like Pitch Black part 6. Will smith would've cracked too many jokes lessening the roughness of the gunslingers personality/character. Maybe nick cage 10/15 years ago could've pulled it off.

This story could have had the epic unfolding of a true tale, a story unwound to the limits of knights, gunslingers, science fiction, and horror. Yet fell so short of the written word. The only way to tell this was the same story I read as  young man was because of the character names. The tale lost its heart. We now have a kinda of cool sci-fi story full of low grade action and no meaning.
I have been reading Stephen King since I was 7 years old. That is 40 years of truly being entertained by Mr. King(thank you) yet I was so excited to see this story come to life and was just so very disappointed. It could have been so much more.

Big pass for me, here's another ""Psycho with a gun movie"". Hollywood is becoming a playground for the lame. All of these whinny pampered celebrities are becoming a major turnoff. The roles were probably chosen due to political correctness and the last thing anybody wants right now is Queen Latifah, Oprah Winfrey or Will Smith  and wife complaining about racial overtones and undertones.

He looks like the gunslinger and he is what I expected. Just because he‚Äôs not Clint Eastwood Jnr does not mean he‚Äôs been badly cast. Other than that the film looks great. The action looks well choreographed, the casting all looks great (I‚Äôm a big fan of Matthew McConaughey as The Man In Black) and the story seems to be a big enough departure from the books so it won‚Äôt harm your experience of the movie if you have or haven‚Äôt read the books.

However it's Flagg I have most been interested in seeing, considering how many books and stories he's been in through the years, and MM seems to have gotten the Man In Black for this story almost perfect. Having first read about Flagg in his intro scene in The Stand ""Randall Flagg, the Dark Man"" walking down that road at night, then seeing the interpretation in the film to this ""The Man In Black fled across the desert and The Gunslinger followed"".",2017-08-01T17:47:23.000Z,4

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),Read all King's novels...most have been butchered as films. Ironically his short stories have been much more successful. Rolland was described as a Clint Eastwood character so the casting appears more political than anything else. There were Black characters in the series...are those roles being color blind in casting too? I suspect not.Long needs to develop more Black characters in his books but has not done a good job so far...shame on him...,2017-08-01T17:43:23.000Z,3

 ""I love it [Elba]. I think he's a terrific actor, one of the best working in the business now. For me the character is still the character. It's almost a Sergio Leone character, like the Man with No Name. He can be white or black, it makes no difference to me. I think it opens all kind of exciting possibilities for the backstory.""

So there you have it. If the character's creator, (the one person that understands that character more than anyone else in the world), is satisfied with the casting, we really can't complain, now can we? Besides, Idris Elba looks pretty fucking cool as a space cowboy.",2017-08-01T06:04:36.000Z,25

Characters from The Stand (including King's favorite go to bad guy Randall Flagg), Hearts in Atlantis, Salem's Lot etc etc. are included throughout the seven novels.  An absolutely genius move on King's part financially, since to truly get the full force of the Dark Tower, you really did have to go back and read all of his older work that led up to this.",2017-08-01T02:04:09.000Z,5

Lots of people are complaining abut the movie for no reason other than it was not the exact adaptation they wanted. And it's a garbage argument since, a movie like ""The Shining"" was a garbage adaptation but a GREAT movie. Did evryone just forget that there was no way that this one movie could adapt the whole 7 books ? I didn't read the books, and I don't care, I just want to see a good movie. Also people are saying this is a sequel ; If it is, then it means most YouTube comments here are just dumb complaints with no logical sense.
If you feel like this movie betrays so much the original book, then just think about it as a story set in a universe parallel to the one of the dark tower books, and stop thinking that this movie should be the exact same dark tower you read.

As someone who started reading King at age 11 and bought the original Gunslinger novel when it was first released in the 80's (as well as each subsequent sequel) this is just infuriating. Hollywood is deliberately trying to emasculate whites by taking our greatest literary and cinematic protagonists and blackwashing them. This is the same as the proliferation of cuckold porn in which an impotent white male character watches sheepishly as black men screw his wife. It is all designed to strip Whites of our pride and dignity, and our collective identity. PROTEST HOLLYWOOD'S WAR AGAINST WHITES BY BOYCOTTING THE MOVIE.

I think Idris Elba will do a great job, he's a talented actor.  Loved him since he burned the screen as Stinger Bell on The Wire.  I wonder if this movie will the the first in a series, or are they going to try to jam all the book into one movie?",2017-07-21T12:19:24.000Z,4

It looks like they are going to try and cram 7 books into one movie. Jake and Rolland are all in the preview but no Susannah  or Eddie. They are kinda important with them being main characters and the books is about a group of people bound by destiny and all. Also is this Jake 1 that dies in the first book or Jake 2? Just saying. If its going to be just one movie they are going to butcher the story and its and leave it an empty shell like a burned out car.,2017-07-15T14:18:43.000Z,5

I hate how they have to give main characters, in the movies these days, super human strengths and abilities. To me, the books were a realistic characters stuck in a surreal fantasy world rather than a superhero in it. Roland was highly trained shooter and boy scout but a highly flawed ""human"".  In fact, Roland would sellout his own mother to reach the tower and was the very definition of good-bad guy.",2017-07-14T15:57:38.000Z,5

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"As far as i know, this is not a movie about the 8 books. But rather a 
story about a fictional 9th one. Stepehen King tweeted ""Last time 
around"" So this probably takes place where the last book has ended. And 
after Roland reaches the top of the tower. there is a line "" You go 
black, you change color"" (maybe not exacty like this, but i read books 
in Hungarian) So it is possible that it is a never ending fight betveen 
good and bad, and they change roles each time. Or it is also possible 
that Roland has to save the tower in the key world. There are many 
worlds...
So anyway. I would not say that this movie is fucked up, 
just becouse Roland is black. Or I dont see Eddie or Susannah in the 
trailer. Im rather excited about the possibilities .",2017-07-14T07:55:51.000Z,6

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Hmmm...I'm provisionally on-board, though with serious misgivings.  Idris Elba has the chops, though I'm not sure the presence, to pull-off Roland.  Jeffery Wright would have been a much better choice.  And while Matthew McConaughey certainly seems to check-off many of the boxes, he's just plain wrong for Randall Flagg.  I think an unknown actor with some sort of ephemeral, otherworldly quality would fit the bill.  As for Jake, if what we saw was any indication, they just plain fucked-up with him.  Big time.

As for the plot and world changes, I don't know man.  What they did to the story looks like it could be interesting, but it seems such an overhaul and simplification...I don't see how it could possibly do the original story justice.  Plus, I don't think the filmmakers understand it's a dying, worn-out _universe_, not just world, that Roland comes from.

I guess I'll just try to forget the books while watching this.  That seems to be about the only way there's any chance of enjoying movie adaptations about 95% of the time.",2017-06-28T07:19:13.000Z,5

I have nothing against idris elba, I think he is cool , but godammit he is not Roland !!

and it is a shame really
I mean the books are pure gold
the movie is probably going to be remembered as a mediocre box office hit , something like ""looper"" or a tom cruise movie
if you're going to make a book into a movie (which nowadays is sooo so common), at least do it fucking right, damnit

This is supposed to be the next iteration of the cylce - the one where Roland didn't lose the Horn of Eld at Jerico Hill.

The loyal readers that have waited for years to make the series into a movie is severely disappointed the producers did not honor the book and the writer.

This is what he looks like in the book illustrations.  I waited so long for someone to make a movie and this is the crap they create.  Very disappointed will not waste a dime of my money on this.  Instead I will once again wait patiently for some producer will make the movie with the characters looking like the illustrations.

Stephen King can support all day long, but that doesn't mean it's good. Look at the turds he's supported like the abortion TV adaptation of Under the Dome.

As soon as Ron Weasley and Lavender Brown got together in film 5 she suddenly became white. Ancient One in the Dr. Strange comics was an Asian MAN but they cast Tilda Swinton...

Will there be a sequel ? And for Roland, Mcconaughey could have made a good Roland if we go for the given definition in the book and considering Clint Eastwood is so old now.

He is a very good actor and I think that he can pull off this role. I always imagined Matthew McConaughey as Eddie, but whatever. 

I know a lot of people are up in arms, but see if this makes sense to you - he's not Roland as you know him, he's an alternate Roland: the same, yet different. It's like James Bond - they're all James Bond, the same and yet different. 

I also like how they've handled the plot - instead of this being based on the books that we've read, this is (SPOILER ALERT!!) Roland's next reincarnation on his perhaps-not-any-longer eternal quest to save the Tower. 

I'm jazzed for this movie to come out and I'm hoping as much as anyone else that it's amazing. The characters and the world that we fell in love with while reading the series deserve nothing less than awesomeness.",2017-05-22T19:01:31.000Z,7

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"I am utterly disappointed with this upcoming film. First off, the gunslinger's white. He has blue eyes, too. Stephen King mentioned this many, many, many times throughout the series. Also, it's not all about the man in black. Where's Maerlyn? Where's Eddie and Susannah? Also, why the heck is Jack going through a hole in a random place to get to Roland's world? He died to get there! And then he went through a door to get there after he died again! This is how physics! Where's the two missing fingers? Roland lost two fingers! The trailer indicates that the movie is based off of the NOVELS, not just the first one. This means that all the other stuff must be there.

They take a much-beloved novel or classic film and try to rework it, change it, when so many people adore the original. So the new interpretation suffers because people want faithful retellings. They should have simply made a cool movie about a burnt-out fantasy warrior trying to stop Armageddon in multiple worlds and they would have had a winner here. If they had simply not associated it with the Dark Tower, this would be an amazing-looking movie.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Also, why cant they respect a characters PHYSICAL appearance? I think that the way a character looks is just as important as his personality. To begin with, this book even goes to great lengths to describe rolands unique physicall appearance. Why do you thinik that Eddie, sussanna or Jake arent so well described? Sussanna is just black and beutiful, eddie is white and has brown eyes, jake is blonde... and thats all we know. The rest is up to our imagination. But rolands appearance is constantly being described. They are constantly reminding us of his cold blue eyes, of how much he looks like  Clint eastwood. And you cant read more than 20 pages without his characteristic cold blue clint eastwood eyes being described along with his pragmatical personality. Its just one of his main, characteristic traits.

Imagine if they made a black, fat and short sherlock holmes, or a white nelson mandela. Canonically we all have the image of a white ronald in our heads, and this movie is ruining just that. I accept these things when a characters physical appearance isnt well specified, like Hermione for example. She has never been specified to be white, or to have a specific look. Everyone can imagine her as they want to. But in EVERYONES head, roland IS WHITE.Ôªø",2017-05-20T03:28:25.000Z,12

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"I was 100% positive that Matthew Mcconaughey was Roland and Idris Elba was the man in black. I recall thinking what outstanding casting choices those were. I'm shocked to see the parts were casted the other way around. It has nothing to do with race.. certain actors just fit certain roles better. Idris imo has a very limited repertoire as an actor, but he plays one-dilemsional characters extremely well, especially bad guys. Roland is a outstandingly completed figure, Mcconaughey would really have to bring his ""A"" game, but he would fit the part well. This is kind of like casting a movie about Martin L. King with the Doctor himself being a white guy. Or a Ghandi movie with Ghandi as a mexican. Now obviously Roland not being white doesn't approach that same level, but it's still the same brand of silliness. It's a shame Clint Eastwood is far to old to play Roland, it would of been one of the all time greatest fits of actor to character. Elba plays basically the same exact guy in every movie he has ever been in, I must say I'm not looking forward to his portrayal as the Gunslinger, as I already know exactly how it will go.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"As a long time fan of the books, I pretty much have to see this, but I'm definitely either gonna love or totally hate it. I have a question though, Does this seem like a friggin harry potter movie to anyone else? or at least somewhere between Potter and Tomorrow-land? even down to the trailer background music, not that I have a problem with the potter series, just not my style, which is probably what I liked about dark tower, It kinda felt like my harry potter series, especially when describing it to someone who had never heard of it. Whereas that series got like eight movies, and it had less overall pages than dark tower, and they didn't feel the need to change large aspects of their story. this just screams PG-13, like a lot of the decisions on the changes weren't ""artistic"" as much as profitable, I get it, it's a ""sequel"".... I probably don't just speak for myself when I say, I don't really want a sequel... after reading a story of over four thousand pages multiple times, I liked the story the way it was, ya know, good...I guess my point is, if you used some of your precious time to read this, is that the twilight people get their series, the Hunger games, the divergent or whatever, get theirs, and this is what we get? I Don't even mind the casting either, I mean not really, Idris Elba was really good in Luther, but check out who they picked for Roland's dad, FUckin lol

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"what truly makes me feel sad, dejected and disappointed is not that this movie doesn't follow the plot or lore of the dark tower, but that because this movie was made, we will never see stephen king's actual vision of the dark tower realized as a movie. 

The dark tower is just to cool not to tell it exactly the way stephen king told it.
the lord of the rings movies followed tolkiens plot almost exactly to the letter, and they are good movies. to mangle or simplify the lord of the rings would have been seen as blasphemous, but people dont have the same respect for stephen king as they do for tolkien, but they should, the dark tower is one of the very best fantasy epics of all time, up there with lord of the rings.

They should have made the movie about the first book in the series. if the audience liked it they can keep making sequels, the way harry potter movies are handled

they should NOT have tried to condense its plot and themes into a single movie, the result is clearly a neutered, simplified and quite frankly crummy facsimile.

I dont really care who stars in it as long as they perform their roles well. its not about casting. this whole concept is flawed. Stephen king should be more protective of his intellectual property.

:
:
:
""The finite mind cannot grasp the infinite..."" - The Man In Black.  This has never been more true than now reading all the hate from (fans?) of King's work.  King himself warned us of this before the Coda at the end of the final Dark Tower book. He warns us not to continue reading. He warns us that nothing he writes within the Tower could possibly fulfill what great expectations we, (the constant reader) have for Roland at the Tower. But we insist. We are Tower junkies like Roland himself. So, King writes it because we MUST see what is at the Tower. And that is the point of the ending. WE are the reason Roland is thrust back to the beginning. In essence, WE the constant reader, we FORCE Roland into that Tower when King warned us to let it go. We did it anyway. 

Now...this time Roland has the horn. I believe that the horn represents hope. I believe that this being the final time around, Roland carries the horn as a symbol of hope. He will right the wrongs from the times before, hence NOT allow Jake to die in pursuit of the Tower. The horn will balance out Roland's obsession for the Tower, and he will make the right choices. In fact, an alternate ending may come of this, where Roland reaches the Dark Tower, is granted entry, but simply walks away. 

Take care of your Ka-tet, (the people in your life that matter most), and let go of the obsession which resonates from the Dark Tower.

Which is actually pretty exciting if you've read all the books. :3 Also, yes Roland was white and that did play heavily into him earning Detta's trust later but if they cut anything from the film adaptation, it will be some of Detta's ...rougher edges and that was the only real important aspect of whatever Roland's skin color may be. Not that I think they should cut anything, but you know they will and if it IS truly meant as a sequel, that opens the doors for any number of things to be different this time around. Anyway, Idris Elba is an EXCELLENT choice for Roland! You don't need blue eyes for a piercing gaze, people. Plus, with all the whitewashing Hollywood has done in the last year alone, imho everyone bitching can suck it. <3 (RIP Ghost in the Shell </3)",2017-05-12T03:14:36.000Z,10

You cannot take 7.5 books (several thousand pages) and make them into a 2 hour movie and treat the fans that read the books.  

I like the concept in a way, but it would have been better as a series on some premium network.  Combine the first 2 books into a season and go on from there, that would surely get enough people to like it enough to make another season, then another and another, etc.  You cannot start from the middle and then expect people to jsut understand.

Hell, even in KING'S own words ( King read on    the early books on tape) that Roland was a thumbnail sketch of Eastwwods man with no name character, I'll never be able to get past that and I'm still not sure if I even want to watch the movie. 
Indris Elba is a very, very good and versatile actor, I don't want to slight him, excellent in The Wire, Prometheus and a movie (i  only saw part of) where he broke out of jail to get revenge on his woman.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Roland is described as not only looking like Clint Eastwood but also looking eerily like the author himself, Stephen King, who resides on the key world. Idris looks nothing like SK, Roland, nor Eastwood.

Roland is based on a real French paladin, does that imply that the original Roland, Charlemagne, and possibly Arthur Eld are also darker skinned? Its very likely this will never be addressed, as a fan of the books this is unacceptable, you cannot change the story and characters without it reflecting on the background canon and mythology.

\\


Back to the original Roland, his king was the aforementioned Charlemagne. In the year 1,000 A.D. the locals dug up Charlemagne's dead body, they feared that the Devil would rise up to Earth and it would be the battle of Armageddon, so they needed the dead king to fight and save the world. This is real history.

Rolands weapons and horn are based on the real Roland's; Durendal and Olifant. These were real, these are real, so to say that its a new universe and those things never happened or they happened in a different way is a cop out, it doesn't address the how or the why, just what happened much later.

\\

Odetta Holmes is also based a real person, if they change Roland then there is a good chance they will change, remove, or otherwise alter her character. This would be insulting to Odetta Holmes and the struggles she went through to realize in her various works of art and activism.",2017-05-11T01:51:49.000Z,6

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"This movie is going to end up like 99.9% of the rest of Stephen King movies:  watered-down, banal, third-rate trash which will easily be forgotten.  Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" was the only excellent Stephen King film adaptation.   Honestly, the ONLY director that would have made a splendid Dark Tower series is Quentin Tarantino.  ""The Dark Tower II: Drawing of the Three"" was like reading a Tarantino script.  Skilled directors like Tarantino or the late Kubrick are the ONLY directors capable of accurately conveying the tension, metaphysical otherworldliness, and downright perverse depravity of a Stephen King novel and conveying it in cinematic form.  I bet this lame Dark Tower movie is going to be rated PG-13 as well, and complete with mindless explosions and lame CGI monsters.",2017-05-11T00:58:56.000Z,30

SPOILER WARNING
SPOILER WARNING

At the end of DT7, Roland reaches the top of the Tower and is horrified to learn that he‚Äôs completed his journey many, many times before. The voice from the tower, which I presume to be Gan, says ‚ÄúThis is your promise that things may be different, Roland ‚Äì that there may yet be rest.‚Äù He is pushed through the doorway back to the beginning of his trek across the Mohaine Desert, but this time he has the Horn of Eld. This is significant, as the Horn of Eld is a symbol of Roland‚Äôs lineage, his purpose and his companions. He was destined to wind the horn as he made his way through Can-Ka-No-Rey (the field of roses at the base of the tower), but in the books, he loses it when his friend, Cuthbert, gets killed at the Battle of Jericho Hill.

Now Roland has the Horn of Eld, it means that everything can change. With the Horn of Eld, he may be less inclined to watch his ka-tet sacrifice themselves for his quest. This is why the trailer shows things that do not happen in the books. Jake doesn‚Äôt die to get to Mid-World, he finds a doorway, like he does in The Sailor arc of The Drawing of the Three, and I‚Äôm willing to bet that Roland doesn‚Äôt make the same choice as before when it comes down to saving Jake or finding the Tower.

I liked quite a lot about the trailer. I enjoyed seeing parts of Mid-World, the Mohaine Desert, Gilead and the portal. I liked the glow in Roland‚Äôs eyes and his guns when he fires. It‚Äôs a good compromise between the bombardier-blue eyes he has in the books, and it also highlights that Roland‚Äôs abilities aren‚Äôt entirely natural to new audiences. Roland looks badass in his outfit, but it does seem a little too pristine for someone who has spent a good chunk of time wandering across an inhospitable desert.

There were a few things I didn‚Äôt like. Jake shouldn‚Äôt have to explain the importance of the Tower to Roland, and Roland should need no encouragement to reach it. However, judging by the obvious ADR done on the dialogue, I do wonder whether that was added to the trailer to explain the basic story. Explaining the Dark Tower to someone can be exhausting, as many fans will attest. 

Also, what were the orc looking things fighting for Walter? They clearly aren‚Äôt Taheen. They don‚Äôt look much like slow mutants to me either. These might be a new addition to the series as cannon fodder for Roland and Jake. That might be a bad call, as the DT books had action in them, but was generally a much slower-paced affair. I‚Äôm hoping they don‚Äôt turn it into an action film with less character development.

That town they were in at the end, that's either Tull or Pricetown, right? Am I forgetting any other settlements?",2017-05-09T16:35:08.000Z,11

However, I'm sorta bummed thinking that they might spend the entire back half of this film in the normal world, as opposed to the Dark Tower world.  Obviously the visuals are on point, it's just a shame if they spend so much of it in our world.  Granted, this is ""Dark Tower"" and not ""Gunslinger,"" so perhaps it spans more than just the 1st book (which might be too ambitious for just one film).",2017-05-09T00:12:14.000Z,0

The Odetta character and their conflict is pivotal in the most climactic situation which is long before they ever get to the tower.  Makes me wonder how the people who thought they needed to modify so much of the actual story, are gonna short shrift the person who gets the role that Odetta manifests in.  That character is really the strongest one in the book.  The character that encompasses Odetta, and another part of who she is.  Black Roland sounds hot, but then how does that work with the relationship that is an intensely huge part of the story?  Maybe don't call it The Dark Tower, but indicate it as an alternative fan fiction based on The Dark Tower.  ...another part of Roland, perhaps how he deals with being separated from the woman who contained Odetta, sometime after the end of that, book.  ....because, ""spoiler"" the philosophic theme is...",2017-05-08T22:17:14.000Z,2

However, I cannot say I'm excited after this trailer. It's a difficult series to adapt, but honestly it feels like this was made by someone who just heard from someone else what the dark tower series is about. I actually think people who haven't read the books will probably enjoy this film more then those who have. To me the Dark Tower series is about characters, 'weird patterns' and the idea of madness. This just seems like hero's journey and action shoot em up. Admittedly watching an interview with Mathew Mcconaughey  he seemed to understand the man in black character but his dialog in this trailer didn't really show it.",2017-05-08T06:49:27.000Z,5

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Someone mentioned they left out Suzannah because of the ""cringe-worthy"" nature of King's depiction. Suzannah was transformed in many ways over the course of the seven books. She had some mental issues at first because of having a head injury. Maybe King''s point was that every human being, regardless of ethnicity or class, Suzannah was from a well to do Black family by the way, ¬†can have mental health issues and still be a real hero as Suzannah becomes . I just think they didn't want to deal with her romance with the other main character, Eddie, who was a poor white¬†guy with a heroin addiction.¬† Hollywood will glamorize violence, but they won't deal with complex issues except in the usual clich√© ways.",2017-05-07T19:29:13.000Z,10

What I loved about the book was the inter-racial romance between Eddie and Susannah. There are deep thematic reasons why Roland should not be black having to do with how King was weaving the story.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"For anyone unfamiliar with the original story this looks fantastic. For those who have read the books, yes, Roland should be white and yes, changing his race does have a significant impact on the story because of racial elements within it that will have to be changed. With that said, Idris is an amazing actor, and from the trailer, it looks like he has absolutely nailed the part, as well as anyone possibly could with physical traits that disagree with the author's description (and die-hards' preconceived notions) of the character. Every movie adaptation changes parts of the story, and as long as they are able to do this while keeping the feel and the overall plot somewhat true to the original (which remains to be seen) I don't think this is a problem. The only issue I have with it is possibly the motivation of the studio to cast Idris. If they cast him because they felt he was the best person for the job, and that casting him was worth the blowback from the picky fans and the changes that needed to be made to the story because of the expectation of a great performance from him, then I applaud them for taking a risk and not excluding him on the basis of race. If, on the other hand, they chose him _because_ he is black, to make a statement to those who try to make everything about race and to gain popularity from those who complain about racism where it doesn't exist, then I think it was a poor choice. Unfortunately, we may never know why they did it, and we will just have to wait and see how true to the source the movie ends up being, and whether it's still a solid movie despite its departure from its roots.",2017-05-07T02:50:34.000Z,14

McConaughey - all wrong for the role. The kid playing Jake - too old and probably mostly wrong for the role. Roland's guns - wrong patina, no etching, and wrong as described in the books - seriously, they looked way to plain. Also, where the hell is Roland's hat?

No way am I paying to see this. I can tell it's for mass audiences and NOT for fans. I wait till it shows up on HBO so I can rip the rest of this film for free.",2017-05-07T02:44:39.000Z,4

The first movie should have been subtitled _The Gunslinger_ but I can live with that. As for changing Roland from white to black, that doesn't bother me in the slightest.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),Unlike the hope I have for IT there is a built-in awful representation of a beloved series I fear. Roland of Gilead deserves a better telling. A miniseries the scope of Game of Thrones would be epic. I'd love a flashback to his battle with Culthbert on the hill.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),This is so wrong on so many levels starting with the casting of Roland. I have read all 8 books and can't count the times that they state that Roland has blue eyes. Why isn't Matthew in that role. I don't understand why Stephen King lets Hollywood totally butcher his fantastic stories. I wouldn't go to see this abomination if they paid me! I was so excited when I first heard about the movie now I am disappointed. These books should have been made into a mini series that stayed true to the story. So Sad.,2017-05-06T19:21:44.000Z,13
2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Anyone who has been following the news for this movie since it was pitched in 08 (maybe 09?) know then that this IS NOT A RENDITION OF THE ORIGINAL 7! Stephen King himself approved of Idris Elba being Roland, and has stated this movie is a continuation AFTER the 7th book.

Any fans of the original books KNOW what happens to Roland at the end of the seventh, and this movie takes place after the last sentence of the last book. King has even stated that Roland does posses the Horn of Eld, so that should be a sign to people what this one is about! 

We already know that Jake died once (though I think he died 3 times in the series all together), and we know that there is a nexus of multiple universes, and that at the end of the seventh book Susannah, Eddie, Jake (and it is implied Oy) have fading memories of what occurred. It wouldn't be surprising if the memories Jake is experiencing in this trailer are the memories he is trying to hold on of his last trip with Roland.

Alright no more spoilers! I'm done.",2017-05-06T19:08:34.000Z,10

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"I think it looks great, but I get the feeling the part where Jake says, ""your world is gone, but mine isn't,"" like Roland needs encouragement to reach the Tower, was put in just for the trailer to explain what is going on to new audiences. Notice the lip sync is off in places. Makes me think different dialogue was recorded for the trailer. There's no way Jake has to explain the importance of the Tower to Roland. That's the only thing I find off-putting. The whole, ""Jake not dying and instead finding a NCP doorway to Mid-World"" thing is plausible in the existing lore, so I don't have a problem with it. Ka, like the wheel.

The trailer generally looks great. I'm looking forward to see where they go with the story, because the trailer indicates massive changes. But it also brings into question whether we'll see Eddie or Susannah. 

Interesting idea for the guns' inscriptions to glow, along with Roland's eyes. I suppose you need something visual to see Ka and the White at work where you can't describe it.",2017-05-06T18:51:25.000Z,1

If it's exactly the same, then what's the point in even watching it?

Forget about the source of the story and judge the film based on the merits. To me the trailer looks pretty amazing.

Originally, I was a little curious about the casting choice for Roland. This was only because it would change the dynamic between he and a certain ""drawn"" individual. 

After some reflection, in the end, I don't think that it's really that detrimental to the story.

I hope the film does amazing. I want them to see it through to the end.

I still think I would have preferred it done as a series on HBO. With what they've done with ""Ice and Fire"" it seems that they could've done wonders with this as well.",2017-05-06T09:39:36.000Z,11

This is not following the story lines from the book. If you finished the series, you should understand that and what the Horn of Eld means, and the last thing Gan says to Roland. This film is a continuation of the story, as Roland has been through the same cycle many, many times and always makes the wrong choices. 

This time around, he has the Horn of Eld, which is the last remaining artifact of All World That Was, aside from Roland's guns. It has the potential to change his path, as having the Horn means almost the entire timeline of the DT could have massive changes. This is why things are happening differently this time, and why this should almost certainly be Roland's last journey to the Tower before he is granted peace.

I figure it at least gives us the chance of a better ending for Roland. He deserves some redemption.",2017-05-06T09:06:59.000Z,7

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"If you read a lot of Stephen King's commentaries about the early days of him writing the series, it's fairly... bland. The first book (The Gunslinger) is also fairly bland compared to the others. I remember him reminiscing in one of his novels about various trips to a cabin in the summer during stormy weather, coming back to the original manuscript and touching it up to the final version of The Gunslinger that's available today. To those just watching this this trailer for the first time thinking for a great action movie, there's a TON of backstory and exposition that makes this universe come to life. This first movie is more of a re-imagining of the series than it is a faithful adaptation. This is coming from someone who has read the Dark Tower series once per year for the past 15 years.

That being said, this trailer has me fairly excited to see how this iconic series is re-imagined in our modern age. For reference, King started writing this series in the '70s and finally finished it in the early 2000's. I won't spoil things for anyone who hasn't read the series, but it goes on some fairly strange tangents (that sandwich sauce [book 6]). Thumbs up if you get that reference.

I feel like this movie is going to pay homage to the original novel (The Gunslinger), but take obvious liberties as it's ""supposed"" to take place after the novels (ie, Roland in NY before ever meeting Eddie). The whole novel series is fairly complex in its timelines. Feel free to debunk me on this.",2017-05-06T01:08:40.000Z,3

P.S. They originally planned on having Javier Bardem as The Gunslinger, but, who would want to watch a movie with a french cowboy? And they wanted Russell Crowe as The Gunslinger in case Warner Bros. picked it up. But he didn't for some reason. So, boom. Idris. Meaning he wasn't really a first choice. So, yeah. That may be why. Not some whale backed Feminazi campaign.

They were the law and had a code of honor they followed. They were not supernatural and neither were the fucking guns. This looks like more Hollywood bullshit. Also, Roland was NOT a hero figure. He was not out to protect the worlds from evil. He was a petty, selfish twat who cared about one thing and one thing only reaching the Tower. The entire series is about addictions of different sorts and how we treat others in our journey through life.

This way, I can draw parallels between the journey that we read in the books, and this telling of it. I don't know, I guess that's me looking for silver linings, but I'm excited none the less. Been waiting for this movie for YEARS. But I am kind of worried that it looks like they are trying to cram too much into one movie. I know they are hoping for enough interest to go forward with either more movies or a series, but I don't know. But then again, it's hard to tell from a trailer. I hope they don't try to cram too much into it though. =/",2017-05-05T04:31:55.000Z,6

It's quite obvious this isn't it. This work could be so well done. The trailer tells me it isn't. What I see is a cheaply made, fast-tracked, hollowed out version of some of King's deepest, most personal work. There were seven novels. No way to compress them into one flimsy movie without losing everything they were really about. Love Idris Elba, but he is no Roland; nor is Matthew McConaughey The Man in Black. And it's nothing to do with race at all. Just poor casting, evident weak characterization and watered down storytelling. So disappointed with the look of this. Bummer.",2017-05-05T03:38:55.000Z,17

I really, really care about what appears to be a butchering of the main themes; mystery, despair, struggle against futility and destiny. I believe Roland (in the books), and by extension the entire series, to be an allegory to 'Do not go gentle into that good night'. 

This trailer feels like a teenage movie something akin to the Maze Runner etc. and that depresses me. Even if it is meant to be Roland on the next time around (an idea that would give loads of creative licence), it should still have the same atmospheric feel to it.

Obviously I can't be sure until the movie is released but as of right now, I'm worried that it has been dumbed-down and bastardised.",2017-05-05T01:15:04.000Z,18

 I'll give it a chance.  From what I've read prior is that this story happens outside of the story in the books.  If you remember at the end of book 7, Roland starts back at the beginning, this time carrying the horn of Eld, which he didn't have at the beginning of the first book.  Each time Roland starts over something else has changed.  This is one of those restarts; most likely the final one. It's very possible that a lot changed throughout his journeys, including his appearance.  Funny thing that I just remembered, back in 1998 I had a dream that they mad a Dark Tower movie, however, Morgan Freeman was playing Roland in it...  Interesting.",2017-05-05T00:46:51.000Z,8

The interiors were shot in a studio in England, and the real inside of Timberline is actually a lot cooler, though less mind-bending.

Fun fact - the Kubrick film used Room 237 instead of Room 217 from the book at the request of the lodge, because Timberline HAS no room 237, and they were afraid patrons would be afraid to sleep in a room associated with the movie.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"As I'm currently reading (again) chapter VII of the Dark Tower series, after watching this trailer all I can say is: ""What in the names of all Gods have you done, Hollywood?""  I mean, this looks very much like the typical film adaptation of a good book: You take the names of the main characters, some elements of the plot and then re-write the script completely differently so that the original book is nearly impossible to recognize. Yeah, we're been told that this is a sequel, so this is supposed to be the chapter VIII? Nope! From what I saw in this trailer I find basically no reason to go and see this film. For me, it just isn't a part of the Dark Tower story I have read and loved for so many years. It might be a good film. Even great. But Dark Tower? Nah, just and reflection of a dark tower in some insignificant parallel universe.",2017-05-04T21:03:46.000Z,10

The story of Jake, Roland, and the Man in Black all happened in the book The Gunslinger.  Jake coming through the portal in the house doesn't happen until The Drawing of the Three.

For that matter, where the hell were Eddie and Susannah during all this?

I couldn't care less if they cast Jackie Chan as Roland of Gilead as long as they're faithful to the story. From what I've seen authenticity to the written work doesn't seem to be a high priority.

This would have worked much better as an HBO series.",2017-05-04T19:23:16.000Z,6

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),Ive read the entire series 3 times including wind through key hole. And there is actually a short prequel to the gunslinger in one of kings collections can't think of the name right now. Anyway people calm down this is a sequel and being Hollywood things will be different. If it turns out terrible so what that won't taint the series if people watch this who have never read series and hate the film then think the series sucks that shows how silly they are. You must read the books and judge them and then judge the film but remember it's a sequel,2017-05-04T19:20:48.000Z,4

When you read these novels are you looking for pictures or putting yourself in the prospective of the hero??  I can see if the Charater was based as such in a Comic Book or biography.  Heck I was upset at the remake of Evil Dead which the Original hero was Ash who was a male. Though I had to think about it was a re-make and not a re-boot! I would be more upset if the movie was way away from the novels. That would be the REAL Issue than a charater of a fiction novel race. SMDH,2017-05-04T17:41:25.000Z,6

In the first few seconds of this trailer, we see the Gunslinger perform an impossible feat.
Somehow tossing a load of six cartridges into the air, and then moving his revolver to intercept them and perform a reload in mid-air, as it were.

Now this would be vastly unlikely under any circumstance, but the revolvers pictured are solid-frame single-action models which would NOT have a swing-open cylinder (were it not for CGI).   Rather, these weapons are loaded singly through a ""loading gate"" on the right side of the frame.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"What about Eddie or Susannah? I think Matthew M. would have been a great Eddie.!.Elba is pretty gangster as Roland..Shots of Gilead look tough..üëçü§†Looks like the story got condensed, so the series premiering in 18' sounds like a good idea..I always thought a show like The Sopranos would be a good way to do it. You could take your time and focus on details, switch up talented directors, ect..
 In the first book The Gunslinger, there's a favorite scene of mine were Roland & the Man in Black make paliver in a Gogetha..""An ancient killing ground."".It was essentially a pit in the rock filled with bones of all kinds..The man in black instructs Roland to gather wood and Roland said he found himself complying & gathering wood like a mere servant or peasant..!!üëâüôÑ 
 Roland doing that air bullet reload thing really takes me back to the books..The Lobstrosities, Tull, Ludd, Tik Tok Man, The psycho train, people going toadash..ect, ect..Alot to work with there..",2017-05-04T16:43:01.000Z,3

And there doesn't seem to be any mention of Eddy or Susana at all, but I get it if they have to cram an ending into a 2 hour movie. That was kinda the point of the books, there never really were well defined endings.

Overall, could still be a good story and the action should be worth a watch. I'm hopeful.",2017-05-04T16:18:06.000Z,10

If this film was marketed on its own merit then it would look good and be exciting to see and would have the fans of The Dark Tower series nudging each other and maybe even tutting about how they have stolen the idea.

But to put this as part of Roland's legacy...sheesh. Never!

I was hoping that one day HBO would adapt it in the same way as Game of Thrones. They would have done a sterling job.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Ok, here's my take. SPOILER ALERT BLANK SPACE



I had always assumed that after each restart things only changed a tiny bit. A myriad of tiny changes that will eventually lead to Roland's salvation. But that's always been my own assumption. What if things actually change A LOT each time? What if every time Roland goes after the tower it's almost a completely different story? Maybe Eddie and Susannah never even show up this time around, and are left to enjoy their reward for their actions in the last loop. This is a continuation after all, not an adaptation.

I'm just as interested to see how the Roland/Detta dynamic will now work as anyone else (if she shows up), but it's also true that not many actors are of a caliber to play Roland. Idris is definitely on a very short list. I'm very much looking forward to seeing what he does with the character.",2017-05-04T14:20:21.000Z,3

Walter. The man in black played by Matthew Mcconaughey is the same person as Flagg in The Stand.

Walter or Flagg is at fault for the majority of horrible events happen in King's works. He moves through time and planes of existence either destroying out of enjoyment or for moving the pieces in place to obtain power or change events.

98% of King's works have to do with The Dark Tower. The readers of the novels would tell you that it's just as if not more epic than the Game of Thrones novels. 

Many characters from King's works pop up in reference or as characters themselves.

Dark Tower has always been the focus. There are very few works that are not attached to The Dark Tower. 

IT is a demon from the same world as Roland. I would be shocked if there were no exchange of references in both movies.

The Mist is attached to The Dark Tower.

It's based on what happens after the end of the storyline of the books. Which, to my understanding, was a perfect loop. Adding to the underlying despair of the story and our hero. Since none of the movie studios had the balls to bring the actual story to film, King now tells us that Deschain is no longer stuck in a loop, but that things change with each run through. Leaving us with a hope that the series did not originally embody, and what is sure to be the bitter taste of sell out in our mouths. It is not a reboot like Star Trek, as King would have us believe. But a departure from his original storyline, which robs us of what made this story what it was in the first place. Replacing despair with a sense of hope that things can change for the better. That Roland mayhap find peace. And escape his fate. Leaving our hero to abandon his post, fading from memory. All the while, trying to dupe the reader into believing that everything works out for the best in the great finality of it all.

No, no claims to the actor (absolutely, he's trying to do his best) but I has it to the scenarists. AND his eyes ALWAYS were blue (frozen steel as it was written in russian).

But does the studio and filmmakers even comprehend the complexities on paper don't translate into the movie media? I hate it when they make a movie out of a Stephen King book. Short stories, yes. Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, Stand by Me, Carrie, are all phenomenal movies because they come from the small kernel of the idea in the mind of King. But full fledged novel are impossible to not screw up, there's just too  much detail. Sadly, I will not watch this movie even with Idris Alba and Matthew McCoughney.

It's really disrespectful to cast a black person for that reason.  Also, the really interesting relationship between Roland and odetta, her being black and him being white is pretty much out the window now.  But I guess if neither of those aspects are going to be in this movie, then they can just make up anything they want.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"(HERE BE BOOK SPOILERS)

To people who accuse book fans of 'whining' about casting of Idris Elba as Roland: you obviously don't understand what it means for the plot of the adaptation. It means that even if Eddie Dean and Detta/Odetta/Susannah Walker appear in the sequel (and I think it's a safe bet they won't appear in this one), the relationship between members of the ka-tet will likely lose in complexity in nuance. It won't be fraught with racism, bigotry and mutual distrust (unless Susannah is cast as a white supremacist or something?).

Similarly, it does not bode well for the portrayal of Gunslinger himself. Let me remind you that the book Roland is as anti-heroic as they come: he is obsessed with reaching the Tower and does pretty horrific things in order to achieve his goal. I guess the jury's out on this, but I just can't see the black lead character murdering an entire village or betraying Jake and letting him fall to his death. It would be ironic if casting a black actor as Roland would lead to the whitewashing of his character.

I'm well aware that this movie isn't intended as a faithful adaptation but rather a sequel to the book series. But turning Dark Tower into a straightforward, good vs. evil, black vs. white (har har) fantasy romp still does not feel right to me.

Still, when viewed on its own, this does look great. Elba's acting and choreography are amazing, the role of RÃ∂aÃ∂nÃ∂dÃ∂aÃ∂lÃ∂lÃ∂ Ã∂FÃ∂lÃ∂aÃ∂gÃ∂gÃ∂  Walter Padick fits McConaughey like a glove. Was thrilled to see glimpses of the King metaverse in the trailer;)

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"*SPOILERS AHEAD*

I'll hold my full judgments for the actual movie, but a huge part of TDT story arc is Roland turning from this ruthless person who seeks the tower for unknown reasons (?), into someone who comes to find kinship and loyalty in the Ka Tet he ""draws"" along the way. 

In fact, Roland's ruthless behavior in the first book is only overshadowed by The Man in Black. If you didn't understand his true motives, when you read the first chapter of the first book it feels like he brutally murders an unarmed farmer for nothing, and is forced to murder a woman who was cursed by the knowledge of the secret of death. Roland is partially insane because he gazed into Maerlyn's grapefruit for far too long. His sense of justice was distorted by it.   

 Idris Elba, on the other hand, seems like he's a hero fighting for ""justice"". I like his chiseled looks as much as the next person, but I agree that they should have made him look more haggard for this particular film. He feels like he exists outside of his decaying world, and is not a part of it.   

 Also, the interdimensionality gaps for characters like Jake have more horror and subtlety aspect in the books. I wish that they played Jake so that his visions were more disjointed and his behavior was more erratic before he resolved the break between worlds. I mean, the kid threw himself in front of a car and saw himself falling through a chasm of eternity. I don't just want other characters to feel like he was insane, I wish that the audience also felt  like HE could actually be totally insane. The confirmation of his ""rantings"" through an earthquake was a bit eyeroll for me.  

Roland is awful chatty in this film and provides a lot of exposition, and I understand why people like that in movies but...  

Thus far, it feels more like a straightforward action film with some jump scares interspersed and a DT flavor

Also, the tone seems kinda off... The books are horror/fantasy with a splash of sci fi. Marketing the movie as an action film just adds to the confusion. I wish this trailer were created more like a horror film and less like an action film. 

In fact, to me, right now, Westworld feels more like TDT than TDT feels like TDT 

I know trying to condense these books into something watchable has been a chore. I understand why they made certain choices and concede to big Hollywood on (probably a lot of) decisions. 

I just hope they did not forget the face of their fathers.",2017-05-04T06:28:52.000Z,4

The long version is, well, longer: It involves not only Deschain following a bad guy called The Man in Black (aka The Walkin‚Äô Dude, aka Randall Flagg) across the desert, a psychic boy named Jake Chambers (Tom Taylor), a woman in a wheelchair with dissociative identity disorder named Odetta/Detta who has tactical sex with a demon and uses the sieve of Eratosthenes to find prime numbers, a heroin addict named Eddie who fights a gun battle naked and defeats an insane train named Blaine with dad jokes. There‚Äôs also a place in New York called the Dixie Pig where cannibal vampire things eat people, and a place in Mid-World called Calla Bryn Sturgis that‚Äôs patrolled by robot wolves. And Oy, a smart, lovable, loyal, toddler-version-of-a-talking-animal who looks like a slinky raccoon and whose eyes are rimmed with gold and if you have read the entire series and your throat doesn‚Äôt lump up at the story of Oy, then you might as well just make a reservation at the Dixie Pig and let them eat your heart because you aren‚Äôt using it anyway.",2017-05-04T04:57:42.000Z,6

If they wanted to change Roland to be black...that's fine...whatever.  They do it all the time in Hollywood.  But after seeing this decision in action for the first time, I'm not as optimistic.  Major plot points from the books aside, I just don't think this works.  And this is coming from a huge Idris Elba fan.  Roland best resembled Clint Eastwood - which after all is who he was written after.  But Roland also resembles Denzel Washington's character from The Magnificent 7.  I think if they would've pursued that route as a character base, there wouldn't be 3/4 of the disappointed Dark Tower fans right now.  I hope I'm proven way wrong on this.

Looks good. I understand why people are upset but having just re-read the gunslinger, adapting just that book into a film I think would be so boring. The medium for that story fits in a book. This movie being a sequel to the whole book series is starting out more action packed and the effects of all worlds coming down is emphasized clearly. Also, hopefully the Crimson King get portrayed as the big baddie that he's supposed to be (or at least referenced more, he only was talked about very minimally in throughout the series and only showed up at the end). With Jake drawing pics of the Gunslinger and all, I think it's portraying that he somewhat remembers the Gunslinger from previous cycles(called Shine or something in the movie) Hopefully Roland remembers also cause the whole reason he has to go through this journey again and again is because of his character and how he would be willing to let others die so he could reach his goal. I'm hoping this movie ends with Roland and Jake on a beach and a door in front of them...ready to Draw the others.",2017-05-04T04:14:43.000Z,3

All of this screaming of racism, because people want a character to be portrayed the way he is described in a book, is not only an irresponsible use of the term racist/racism, but it's foolish and ignorant. Please educate yourself before commenting. There's an old saying that states, ""It is better to keep your mouth closed and give the impression that you're stupid, than to open it and remove all doubt.""",2017-05-04T03:56:07.000Z,10

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"I hate to admit I'm a bit...mixed on this.  On one hand, despite some people here, I love the casting of Roland and The Man in Black (yes I'm totally fine with Roland being black, Idris Elba is one of the best actors in Hollywood).  I also really love the idea of this being a sequel of sorts to the final book (readers know what this means).  

However...the tone of this doesn't really match up with the incredibly grim, dark tone of the books.  This seems a bit too glitzy and show-offy.  I'm also not getting the impression that this is a hard R movie, which it absolutely needs to be, perhaps more than the vast majority of R-rated films to come out in recent memory.  The Dark Tower deals with absolutely grotesque themes, extreme violence, insanely vulgar dialogue and more than a healthy serving of sex and nudity.  Making it appeal to a more mainstream audience would be a deathblow, in my mind.",2017-05-04T03:46:51.000Z,5

Aside from that, and maybe some dialogue, this looks NOTHING like the story I read. Sorry, Idris. I really do like you, but it seems Mr. King sold out on this one.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Ok so as a fan of the original book series, (as well as the ones that are tie ins, like insomnia, everything's eventual, hearts in Atlantis, etc), I can understand the frustration of some of the commentors. But there are a few things to keep in mind here. As for Roland being black in this movie, I too did have concerns because what ramifications would that have on Susannah's character since much of what made her who she was was an undertone of isolation being the not only the only female but also the only black member of their ka-tet. In this movie that's going to be a non issue since her character is not in it. Now whether this becomes a franchise & they eventually do more movies or not may change that. That being said, Roland is a rather difficult character to cast for & Idris is one of the few people whom can pull it off. So I think it's only fair to give him a chance. Additionally, you also have to remember, for those that really DID read the books, Roland has the horn of Eld in this movie. that is very important because the only point in which he has it in the books is when he is standing in the Mohine desert AFTER reaching the tower at the end of the 7th book. in the story arc of the books, the horn of eld was lost on Jericho hill & only returned to him at the end as he began a new cycle, immediately forgetting the last. this movie IS that new cycle. sure I wanted to see Eddie, Susannah, the people of Calla Byrn Sturgis, Callahan, Patrick Danville, even John Farson, all those people too. The raid on Algul Siento, Jake & Callahan storming the Dixie Pig, ol double ugly getting eaten alive by monstrosities, & maybe that is all still to come in future movies. or maybe that will be in a tv show format where honestly books tend to better translate to film anyway. however it's clear that this movie is not an adaption of the 7 cannon novels, but a continuation from where they ended. this movie is starting not at the the beginning of the gunslinger, (book 1) but at the end of the dark tower, (book 7). in short, new territory. So go into it with an open mind.",2017-05-04T01:42:13.000Z,28

Stephen King doesn't care that he's black. To be fair, he originally envisioned Clint Eastwood as Roland, but that was when Clint Eastwood was in his prime as a spaghetti western kind of guy. Doesn't really matter now because Eastwood is a beast of a director. 

""For me the character is still the character. It's almost a Sergio Leone character, like the Man with No Name,"" while remarking, ""He can be white or black, it makes no difference to me. I think it opens all kind of exciting possibilities for the backstory.""

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"There's definitely a few problems here in my opinion. My issue specifically is with the nature of the dark tower that is depicted in this. I feel like in the books it was something beyond comprehension, a constant thing in the background which drives everyone in the books almost to the point of obsession, the centre of everything that is. It just seems almost a little clich√© the way they depict it here, although It's just a trailer so that might be an early judgment. I also feel the series wasn't as focused on fight scenes as much as this, it was always sudden bursts of violence which almost shocked the reader. Obviously they have also smashed many parts of the book into one story which is a little disappointing but understandable because of the length the movie can't really do an epic like the Dark Tower series justice. 

I don't know what all the complaining about Roland is about though, Idris definitely got the feeling of the character, I don't think his race is really an issue. It's pretty refreshing actually, and if the movie is trying to keep a distance from the exact story of the books then it does make sense to change it up a little. To be honest I'm just happy that this will more than likely encourage a wider audience to get into the books. I feel they never really got the praise they deserved.

For example, the boy gets horrifically killed in the street and then magically wakes up in the desert. He does not get swept of on a magical adventure. This is definitively just cramming the whole DT series into fantasy story telling conventions.  It looks like they are stripping away the really special aspects of the story for a run of the mill summer blockbuster flick.",2017-05-04T00:26:15.000Z,8
2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),Idris Elba's casting as Roland is an obvious red herring to stir up Internet controversy so that people will go out to see the movie to prove that they aren't racist. The producers obviously took way too many creative liberties with the source material and the end result is inevitably going to be mediocre. I have a sneaking suspicion that this movie was made by jamming a bunch of half-assed dark tower references into some rejected fantasy-action movie script that a studio exec found at the bottom of his file cabinet next to the baggies of cocaine and used condoms. the only purpose this movie serves is to prevent the studio from losing the movie rights to the dark tower. Remember that shitty Fantastic 4 movie that caused the exact same controversy by casting a black guy as the human torch? That movie was made at the same time that Fox was about to lose the rights to Fantastic 4. It's a shame that Idris Elba got conned into starring in this abomination. He's a great actor and I hope this doesn't destroy his career.,2017-05-04T00:26:14.000Z,4

Also said by Stephen was that during most of the books written during this time period he was a ""raving alcoholic"". I more than likely will not go see it because it seems to be another horrible adaption of the books. If it was a good adaption of the books it would make no difference the color of the lead character for me.

It seems like there was a lot of focus on the boy as opposed to Roland. The fact that they also toss in the Tower and the Beams and make it all about one confrontation to save the world just feels lazy. 
Hopefully, I am wrong, and all the stuff in the trailer is just action highlights from the film and not its core. So much of the stories in the books were about Roland's journey and how the world had ""moved on"", and how he had to constantly adapt in a world that kept becoming more and more Savage. He only used his guns when he had to. He didn't just kill everything in his path. Hopefully this stays mostly true to that.",2017-05-04T00:21:05.000Z,4

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Ok, so it seems that this entire movie will have nothing to do with the original story from the books. That is very disheartening, as I wanted to see that story be brought to life at some point. 
But it would at least partially explain why Roland is suddenly black, because the Dark Tower is basically holding the multiverse together and in one of those worlds, Roland could defintely be black. I'm ok with that now. 
But there's still a lot about this trailer that makes me fear that this will just be a run-of-the-mill overly stylised action movie which compresses too much of the mythology of TDT into an incoherent mess and is more concerned with over the top action-scenes. Gunslinger shooting without looking? One of the essential parts of the mantra Elba is reciting in this trailer is ""I do not aim with my hand, [...] I aim with my eye"". Gunslingers are great shots, but they aren't Jedi. Same goes for the silly mid-air reload.
I'm now willing to give this movie a chance, but my expectations after this trailer are VERY low. I do however like the eastereggs about other King works in the movie, and I think McConaughey as Walter/MIB and the actor they have for Jake are fitting for their roles.
I'm just still sad that they didn't try to adapt the original source material. I would've loved to see the original Ka-tet in action. Without Eddie and Susannah, there's just something missing.",2017-05-04T00:11:10.000Z,12

Many times it's arbitrary or the written source isn't very descriptive about the main character in that way.  People are disappointed in this case because so much of Roland's identity, look, and attitude were very much a Clint Eastwood type cowboy.  When you read SEVEN books and have visualized that character for literally decades in that manner it can be a little jarring to have it flipped on it's head.  Personally I'm fine with it.... but I was also a bit surprised at the casting.  It's not racism at all.  End of story.",2017-05-04T00:06:04.000Z,47

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"this isn't a direct adaptation of the books, but actually a sequel to them...  After Roland finally reaches the Dark Tower and faces off against a villain known as the Crimson King. It‚Äôs there that he discovers that he‚Äôs gone on this quest before, many times, and is sent back to the beginning of his journey by a being known as Gan each time. In prior quests, Roland had left the Horn of Eld with a dying compatriot after a battle. In this latest version of the quest, he kept it with him, which changes things for the next cycle of the story.

The implication here is that the film is set after The Dark Tower (the novel): Roland has been sent back to the beginning of his quest, and the events of The Gunslinger will play out in a slightly different way. As we saw in the trailer, he meets Jake Chambers, and is going after The Man in Black.

I envisioned this story to be told in both movie and television formats.  That is a bit risky given the amount of material, but it can work.  Books 1, 3, 5, & 7 would serve as movies, with the 7th book being split into two movies.  There are five movies there.  Books 2, 4, and 6 would be adapted into three television series, preferably on HBO or Showtime.  There are three seasons there.  This would have to be filmed consecutively as LOTR was to account for the length of time the book series runs.

Now, the trailer does seem to show a few things. They try to showcase Roland's prowess with his revolvers and it doesn't really sell me on it per se. Frankly I think a worse casting decision was putting Matthew in the movie. He lacks the playful sadism to play Martin.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),It looks terrible....this was the Stephen King novel I dreaded most becoming a movie. The books don't translate well to the screen and should've been left in the imagination of its readers.  Elba can play an awesome hero and we know Mc Conaughey can do epic bad guy.....but the look of this trailer.....they both seem miscast. You can already see bad CGI in use......strays from the story.......this is a movie that was forced to be made that never should have been.

For the naysayers of Elba being cast as Roland,  I wonder if I was more biased by the art on the covers and King's interviews of him wanting to write his own western, than actually knowing what color he was in the novels.  I think too many of pictured a grizzled Clint Eastwood, or at least I did.

1. Gunslingers weren't knights, they were gunslingers. 
2. Why would Roland point a gun at a child? 
3. Why is he firing SO MUCH at NO ONE!? He conserved ammo because it was hard to find. Reload CGI is cool, but still haven't seen him load like in the books.
4. The man in black is the minion of the Crimson King. He isn't the main bad guy. Also, the man in black only slows Roland down. He doesn't really try to kill him, IMO. 
5. The bad guys want to control the Dark Tower, not destroy it. 
6. Apparently the tower connects only our world and Roland's? Where are the roses? Or did I miss that?
7. Jake is psychic, and he can see Roland, ect. 
8. The thinny looks like a Stargate, not a thin place. 
9. Roland's Dad is the Allstate guy! 
10. Roland rarely misses. But he can't use his ears to sense where that bad guy is. Like a toddler's understanding of echolocation.

I know it was King's call all around but this complete reimagining of the Dark Tower is going to have an impact when it comes to bringing in new fans through this film. Elba is a strong choice for this role and what I saw here his work as Roland definitely fascinates me and I will go see this film, but for decades Roland was a kind of Clint Eastwood doppleganger, how come nobody is complaining about black washing a figure from a major twentieth century franchise which has an already cult like fanbase, has become a part of our shared cultural mythology in it's own way?

I just don't understand how they could take something as fully-realized and laboriously descriptive as TDT series and relegate it to some big-budget sci-fi action blockbuster that takes FAR too little from the source.

I feel Eddie was a bigger part of the story but isn't recognized yet...How about a shot of Susannah....?  The Man in Black wasn't quite shown this much in the books...Would have liked to see more of Gilead...
  I'm curious what part of the series this film is stepping into? Looks like there jumping around a little, which is to be expected.. I gotta say Elba is pretty gangster for Roland..üî´ How about some throwback stuff with Alian and  Cuthbert...I always thought a cable show like The Sopranos would be a good way to do this story..You could focus on smaller parts and really get detail oriented..So, it sounds like the continuation by series in 18' is a good idea..These books have always been a big part of my life, so I want them to be done correctly, by an artistic director, and everyone involved in the project..

It feels like a quick cash grab on Stephen Kings books and they're hoping that star power and the name only will get people to watch the film. They explain a little too much with this trailer, especially with the purpose of the tower. I like a little mystery to it, when I go to watch a film. Now I know it's going to have some sort of doomsday apocalypse scenario and the heroes must do something to stop it. Come on! Terrible first trailer.

Based on the Best-Selling Series by Stephen King, comes a dark sci-fi action film about a cool gunslinger who can do any shooting skills to become a loop post apocalyptic hero. Idris Elba will be cool as the main lead and tags along with the young boy who knows about the prediction. McCoughney looks cool as a villain and the rest of the plot seems cool for a different Stephen King setup. Of course I got a cool poster from my nephew who worked at the AMC theater and I thank for him for giving some anticipation to see this movie.

Besides, the books are about multiple worlds.Every fan of the series knows that. Perhaps in this world, Roland is black, Jake is a little older. 

Also I've been searching up the movie and The Man In Black is holding the Horn of Eld in one of the toys. So this means that this continues the story of the books, not go along with them. Roland having the horn at the end could have dramatically changed event that goes one in the timeline.",2017-05-03T21:37:48.000Z,0

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"As far as character selection goes, while Idris Elba is a good actor, it is known to those who read the books that Roland Deschain was based on Clint Eastwood.   Clint Eastwood is old, he's 86 now.  A suitable replacement would be Viggo Mortensen.  He has the look, and he's a good actor.  Plus, he's 58 now, and the only time Roland was ever truly portrayed as young, was in memory flashbacks and in Wizard and Glass and in The Wind Through the Keyhole.  

And for everyone saying Roland was never truly portrayed as white, yes he was in Drawing of the Three when Detta referred to him as a Honk Mofa and also sensed his complete whiteness, and in The Dark Tower it was while he was with Irene Tassenbaum that it was further revealed that not only was he white, he may have had Native American blood as well.

And for everyone else saying it has already severely deviated from the books, yes it has!  It was supposed to!

If you didn't actually get to the end of the books, you missed a major clue.  This is a continuation of the book series, and that has been acknowledged.  This is not a typical film adaptation.  This is using film to continue and hopefully conclude one of the best series I ever read, and what can easily be argued as the best work of Stephen Kings writing career.",2017-05-03T21:37:30.000Z,0

I understand some people's plight for producers to stick to the authenticity of characters and plot lines from the books but MY LORD, you dont have to be nasty about it. IDRIS ELBA did a GREAT JOB (based on the trailer). Shouldn't you want the BEST actor for the job to pull off all the exciting bits from the book? If the color of his skin is going to ruin the movie for you and prevent you from actually enjoying it for what it is then YOU ARE RACIST!!! I'm pretty sure after a few minutes of the film, most people would even forget that the main character is supposed to be white.

Some of you people even go to the extent of attacking Idris' body of work. Its such a shame that as time progresses people have not. Our way of thinking has to change. We should have tasteful disagreements not a nasty racist rants.",2017-05-03T21:16:49.000Z,18

Some are, but most just want to be true to the written word they have already experienced.  I love Elba and I think he is awesome but, i don't think he should be the next James Bond either.  James Bond is a white secret agent - always has been!  While he's a supporting character, not a main character, imagine they remade Rocky and made Apollo Creed white???  I know I'd be pissed!  Not because I'm a racist! Rather, Apollo was originally a black character - and I liked it that way.  I be pissed not because they chose a white guy.  More so that they changed the context of the story that I enjoyed.  
What really needs to happen is black writers need to come up with better story lines that will appeal to broader audiences.  This years ""Get Out"" is a prime example.  We have to figure out a way to get stories other than gangs, drugs and violence on the big screen.   Then black actors would have more prospects and opportunities to play interesting characters that are written for them. 
I know Hollywood is f***'d up but it can be done!

Idris Elba is a great actor, and I would enjoy the movie if its good regardless of how close it is to the book if its told right.",2017-05-03T20:23:45.000Z,0

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"I just spent about twenty minutes reading all the comments, just to get a better gauge on what other people's opinions on this trailer are, their insights into the discrepancies between the books and this film, etc, etc.  So I've read that people are considering it a ""sequel-ish"", being that time travel, teleportation and the ending of the literary saga allows for such things after Roland passes through the Tower Door.  But these don't really interest me as explanations, nor does this film being some amalgamation of Books 1, 5, and some new re-imagining that some Hollywood scriptwriters put together.  Seeing this just confirms my fears that I won't want to see something I've looked forward to, and that's not saying it will be a bad film, it's just not the film I want to see.  

This reminds me a lot of I Am Legend, since Hollywood has made that incredible story into a film three times, and all three were ok films, just ok at best; but they never seem interested in capturing the grit and horror of the book.  That's what this looks like, it looks like a good film for most people unfamiliar with the source material, but from what I as an insanely committed fan of the book series hoped for, I'm just not seeing it in this trailer, nor have I felt it when reading about the making of this film.  To everyone who see's it, I hope it's good and you enjoy it, but I just know I won't, so I just won't ever watch this.

The books will have to be my wealth spring, since it looks like Hollywood has miles to go yet, before doing this epic true justice.",2017-05-03T20:22:56.000Z,0

Being a reader of the books and remembering the ending of book 7 referencing The Horn of Eld and taking 3 seconds to pick it up would of made all the difference 2 the end of Rolands tale. After he enters the door he is back at the begining of his journey in book 1, but the 1 big difference is, he has the horn this time. He touches the horn on his belt and the voice of Gan or the tower says "" this is your sigil. This is a promise that things may be different Roland- that there may be rest yet. Even salvation"" A pause and then: "" If you stand. If you are true."" If this movie is a sequel to the books or a continuation after the books thats the direction i think it's going. This could be his final journey to The Dark Tower and if it is i whole heartedly stand behind it. I can't wait for this 2 come out!!!

For anyone complaining, you guys should know that this movie is a sequel to the books, anyone who's read the ending will know that the tower causes a timeloop everytime the gunslinger enters, only that in the final pages, The Gunslinger has the helmet with him in this timeloop along with his memories, suggesting at the end that it will be the last loop, set photos of the movie, show the helmet, suggesting that the movie is about the gunslinger breaking the loop and not a straight adaption of the books

Elba is a fine actor but he just doesn't fit this role, especially¬†after so many repetitions of what the Gunslinger looks like in the novels (the phrase ""faded blue eyes"" has been used over & over).

Within 1 minute so much was wrong with the story that I could barely keep watching. The dark tower series is a very deep, confusing and twisting system of books that have the reader constantly wondering what will happen. Not to mention most of the stories happen in multiple storytelling ways, and much of what is found out about the settings is learned through the main characters thoughts only. The books make  you care for the characters in a way because so much of the series do not have a straight forward emotional statement from the characters. Even the main character speaks about his emotionlessness throughout.

The series of books had action but it wasn't an action movie. I hope the  director gets that... I'll also add, Stephen King's a great writer but a total crap director, and the more control he gets over his films, the worse they are. Hearts in Atlantis, the Windcatcher - both excellent novels. Both horrendous films... And it kinda looks like that kid can't act? No offense... It's a really hard part for a kid to play. Here's an excerpt from the original story:

""Jake opened his folder to take a final look at what he had written on the topic My Understanding of Truth.  He was genuinely interested in this, because he could no more remember writing his Final Essay, than he could remember studying for his French final.  
 He looked at the title page with puzzlement and growing unease.  MY UNDERSTANDING OF TRUTH, By Jake Chambers, was neatly typed and centered on the sheet, and that was all right, but he had for some reason pasted two photographs below it.  One was of a door - he thought it might be the one at Number 10, Downing Street, in London - and the other was of an Amtrak train.  They were color shots, undoubtedly culled from some magazine.
 Why did I do that?  And when did I do that?

I'm not joking. It didn't even occur to me until I took a look at the article's comment section, and even then I didn't care because I loved the choice so much. For years, I had heard so many casting rumors, from Javier Bardem to Russell Crowe, but none of them ever felt quite right. With Idris, I can't think of a better fit for the character working today. Not only does he have the gravitas, I fully believe that he can sell both the fact that this guy is older than he looks and his rather mysterious personality.",2017-05-03T19:03:56.000Z,113

Idris Elba is a fantastic actor and I think he will do a good job with the character.

However the tone and feel of this trailer seems way off from the books, like by allot. The books were always more character driven with allot of word building throughout. They tended to be a fairly slow burn with a couple of decent action scenes spread around, that's how it was in every book. The first book in the series, though it has been awhile sense I read it, only had like one big action scene in it, the one right at the start.

 This trailer seems to show off what looks to be a fairly generic action movie, and is way off from any of the books.
Hell, *Spoilers* don't read if haven't read the books yet, In the book Roland doesn't even go to our more modern world until the second book, and he didn't go there with the kid, and it was after he got his fingers on his right hand tore off, which then got infected, and he nearly died because of it.

I won't judge the movie based on the trailer, as I truly hope the movie is good, but if what I'm to expect from the movie is similar to what's mostly being portrayed in this trailer then I am going to be extremely disappointed.",2017-05-03T18:53:53.000Z,0

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Trailer looks awesome. But obviously, people are not reading articles about the movie.

From EW: ‚ÄúThe hardcore fans of The Dark Tower series will know that this is actually a sequel  to the books in a way,‚Äù director and co-writer Nikolaj Arcel says. ‚ÄúIt has a lot of the same elements,  a lot of the same characters, but it is a different journey.‚Äù

Without doubt, the most significant story change is the absence of two major characters who, in the books, were pulled from our world to join Roland‚Äôs quest: the reformed heroin junkie Eddie, and the amputee with multiple personalities, Susannah.
Constant Readers who‚Äôve been following the production have probably noticed that no one has been cast in those roles yet. The bad news: they won‚Äôt be. Although‚Ä¶ an allusion to them may be in the cards.
The good news: if there‚Äôs a sequel, they are guaranteed.

From Collider: For those of you still concerned that this adaptation won‚Äôt be in line with King‚Äôs vision, the acclaimed author had this very frank statement to share:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm 100 percent behind it ‚Äî which doesn‚Äôt mean it necessarily will work, just that it‚Äôs a good way to try and to get into these stories.‚Äù

But like others said it could be another cycle, so it doesn't have to be faithful. As long as they actually do that I can see the movie working, it gives it more room to do whatever. But I'm still mostly just expecting a popcorn flick.

GOOD SIGNS are the attention to detail though. The 7 beams supporting the tower, the red graffiti, Roland's line about shooting, that building Jake get's to mid world with that portal is in seems a lot like the one Callahan died in (the restaurant).",2017-05-03T18:35:38.000Z,0

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),People lay of Idris and McConaughey both have shown in recent years to be capable actors. Irrelevant of the actors looks if they can portray the personality and temperament of the character that is all that matters. The real issue is if they try to shove such a large book series into such a short run time. A rich story that would have been better served as a TV/Netflix series and is being shamed with its runtime here. ,2017-05-03T18:36:52.000Z,0

(Feel free to name others I've missed.)

But at the heart of the film, it's about a post-apocalypse western/sci-fi with the set design of Wild, Wild West. That's all you need.

I'm going to enjoy this film for what it is, because it is impossible to make anything but an adaptation of King's Dark Tower. The literature is Game of Thrones on bath salts. If you've read the series, you wouldn't even WANT to see a movie or series that was true to The Dark Tower's mythos.

A lot of people are crying foul because SPE is turning this into seemingly another shoot'em up that doesn't follow the plot of the book and I am in that camp.

Every time Roland goes through the door things change and it's inferred he's gone through the door many many times. SPE can just claim this is one of a near infinite number of cycles where things are just different from the one we read.

Going through sometimes, we don't know what to do.
Going through and help us Lord to still worship You in Spirit and Truth.

Going through, sometimes it feels like you are not there.
Going through, Lord help others understand sometimes we are not prepared.

Going through even when people are trying on us to depend.
Going through even those who think we might not be alone fail to realize we all still need Godly friends.

Going through even when we don't understand or unable to  see. 
Going through because it is only by means of what the Lord did at  Calvary  can save, help, and redeem you and me.

Have the expectation that the movie will be nothing like the book. Think of the movie being more inspired by the book...using the same characters, some of the same plot, and some of the same setting. Then you will be more likely to enjoy it. 

I can't think of a single movie adaptation that was 100% faithful to the book. It will never happen.",2017-05-03T17:28:31.000Z,0

I've read them soo many times.  Movies are not books and books are not movies.  When did a movie ever faithfully recreate a book?  Never.  It's not possible because the mediums are completely different and a movie is an artists interpretation of a book.  Much like how you may have envisioned Eddie or Susannah/Odetta when you read the books is not the same as how I envisioned them.  Stephen King has said that this is more like a sequel to the books than a film adaptation.  That's great!!! Keep the books pure and give us an additional part of the story.  Spoiler for those who didn't read the books, but the story goes on.  As the books say, ""There are other worlds than these"".  This world we see here is different than the world we know from the books.  It doesn't mean it's horrible or wrong.

I was a little miffed at first that they cast an african american actor to play Roland because he is so clearly described as a white man with bright blue eyes, but Idris Elba is a spectacular Actor. If you haven't seen Luther then you don't even know...
That being said - true fans of the books will let this slide. They know that this is not a direct adaptation but a sequel. And that many things can change on different levels of the tower -  and at different cycles (in the books 2 non-relative characters are blood brothers in a different version of New York so a families race changing is not hard to believe at all). I have no problem with it, and I for one, have gone from cautiously optimistic to overtly hopeful.

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"I always thought one of the coolest scenes in the book was when Eddie had to shoot his way out of a drug house butt-naked. That's courageous. But the entire Gunslinger mythos has always inspired me for some odd reason. To have guns that are forged from the swords of Arthur Eld, to wield them as the Gunslinger did, to have been raised in a culture where the Gun is the way of life...all of these things create an almost mystical world full of technology, dereliction and decadence from a time not entirely separate from our own. It's almost as though the things we've discarded have fallen through to Roland's world. It's where the pillars of our own universe--and many others--are firmly rooted. I don't know...I just feel like we're all looking for our own Dark Tower and some are more driven than others. And there are those of us who are driven to extremes that some would say border on lunacy. Whatever our Dark Tower might be--whatever it is we're looking for--sometimes we have to discard the things most precious to us to find it, to scale the stairs and to reach the top. I know Roland the Gunslinger lost a lot in the books. Love and sense of self being but two things out of many. He's seen a lot and he has a kind of 'frontier wisdom' that I hope comes through in this cinematic adaptation. I'm holding out for ""Cool Blue Shooter's Eyes"" such as Roland had in the book. Roland, for me, has become an archetype for one who has lost it all just trying to find his way in the world, utilizing skill sets that some of us may view as archaic but that in his world are indicative of an old and ancient nobility. The books got a little slow, at times, and were somewhat difficult to finish. But I did finish them. All the way. To the very End. Be careful what you make your Dark Tower out to be.",2017-05-03T14:30:41.000Z,0

2017-05-03T13:19:17.000Z,GjwfqXTebIY,THE DARK TOWER - Official Trailer (HD),"Okay. Just saw this for the first time. Here's my opinion. First, Matthew McConnaghey definitely knows how to play the bad guy. I can tell from these few clips. I think his  version of Randall Flagg aka The Dark Man aka The Man in Black is gonna be really interesting. Much better than Jamey Sheridan in The Stand miniseries. Second, where is the fantastical element? You definitely don't know this is a work of fantasy judging by this trailer. It makes it look more like a gangster flick. Just scene after scene of Roland shooting guns. Though that shot of Jake going through the wall was pretty cool. They should've showed fields and fields of roses or something. Or had the Beatles singing Hey, Jude in the background. But overall it looks pretty decent.",2017-05-03T14:30:34.000Z,0

As far as the source material, this is a sequel to a series, that has a multiverse, cyclical repetition, and divergent timelines.  If they said it was a sequel and then changed nothing, the would be worth getting mad about. As far as Detta Walker and Roland, Detta was universally rude. And she'll probably still use race against Roland and Eddie. I understand changing the source material bothers people, but the Dark Tower series is based heavily on everything changing, other worlds, etc. Does Roland being black really seem such a radical departure?",2017-05-03T14:04:15.000Z,0

Most people won't have even read the book prior to seeing it. A lot of THOSE people will be using their cell phones or will be obnoxious. 

What I'm saying is, if the color of someone's skin being a wittle bit darker than you can handle turns you off from the movie then just sit it out. As for most of us, we can actually have decent reasons for enjoying or not enjoying the movie. 

I mean none of this is real anyway and some of you are butthurt. üòÇ",2017-05-03T12:25:43.000Z,0
