The characters dont have as much impact. that clarence guy in the original is scary as hell and the scene where they torture Murphy always gets my heart pounding.  Its such a build up while Murphy tracks the gang down, and of course the scene in the construction yard when he gets that spike in his neck. Man the original had some serious balls. The remake is just too flashy and action focused, it doesnt have any of the dark, gritty violence or atmosphere of the original. I dont think the remake is the worst remake i've ever seen, its still a lot better than the shitty Total Recall remake. Shame they always have to go for the PG13 rating. The Dredd remake is the only remake released in years which actually has the guts to make it gritty.

I didnt like how the remake focused more on his family. I thought it was better in the original when they pretty much brought him back as a machine and his human soul is still alive and trying to regain some memories and his family assume he's dead.

Weller's robotic motion, his death scene where he gets shot up violently, the fact his family is dead and he can never connect to them, the satire on 80's politics and corporate consumerism, the theme of resurrection.
