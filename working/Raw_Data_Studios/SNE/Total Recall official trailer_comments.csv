- The font for the title is exactly the same style as the 1990 film.

- The mere fact that they called it 'TOTAL RECALL', when the story is called 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale'.

Basically remakes make more money to the masses for hollywood then original scripts. People are more likely to go see a remake of a an older film from the 80s or earlier, because they are familiar with the storyline. Compared to going & seeing a new movie with an original script & leaving disappointed, they think there is less likely of a chance. Sadly its shown that in the movie ticket sales to be true.

One is the fact that the movie does look aswome on it's own. Special effects look solid, action looks top notch. It would be worth seeing....if you NEVER seen Total Recall.

On the otherside I am angry, outraged by Hollywoods constant rampage to rape every orignal franchise in movie history. My mother (God rest her soul) is probably rolling around in her grave because this was her and I's favorite action movie of the 90's.

2012-04-01T23:46:05.000Z,GljhR5rk5eY,TOTAL RECALL - Official Trailer - In Theaters August 3rd,Thats what im saying and arnolds version isnt a master piece cause they in a sense ruined or never relavated on the poltical themes or psychological themes of the original novel that arnold version was based off. The author by the way was Philp K Dick and if he saw arnolds version he would have been vey pissed. He didnt mind blade runner cause it stayed true to his concept but the arnold version of total recall didnt stay true to dicks themes and his stories NEVER HAVE HAPPY ENDINGS!!!!,2012-04-05T03:06:41.000Z,0

First yes trailers are suppose to make hype. However it not made so that you could make a judgement upon the movie.
In most trailers there not even any real content in them. 
Trailers says shit all about a movie, and any one who not half brain dead
would know this. 
Second the Original had very little to do with the actual book. So I see it as a movie with a semi close theme and nothing else. This might follow the book.

2012-04-01T23:46:05.000Z,GljhR5rk5eY,TOTAL RECALL - Official Trailer - In Theaters August 3rd,"Looks like they took away the Mars part of the movie.  And looks like a lot of CG as opposed to the original which used practical effects making it look more real and less like you are watching a video game cut scene.  

I liked the original where it left weather it was all real or in his head up in the air for the audience to decide.  I don't think this one will be as subtle.  ",2012-04-02T15:36:26.000Z,0

2012-04-01T23:46:05.000Z,GljhR5rk5eY,TOTAL RECALL - Official Trailer - In Theaters August 3rd,"This is based on a short story of the same title by the late Philip K. Dick, one of the best science fiction writers OF ALL TIME.  The reason it may seem unoriginal is that his ideas have been reused countless times in modern science fiction.  This was one of his better stories of the dozen or so that I have read.  Did I mention that he also wrote minority report?  You should probably check out his work.  Some of the best science fiction I have ever read. Thumbs so people see this please. Thanks",2012-04-02T01:32:53.000Z,0
