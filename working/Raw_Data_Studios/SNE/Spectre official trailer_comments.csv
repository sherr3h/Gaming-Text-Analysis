That's a preview of how your next Bond instalment will do.  Now take a look at the box office results for that movie that doesn't shove SJW and agenda down audience's throats despite mainstream media's attempt to demonize it.

Craig has verbally shit on the entire Bond franchise with his recent comments, and hates making Bond films.  This is what fame, money, and celebrity do to people. They forget how desperate they were when they accepted a certain role, and once the fame and money hit, then they're suddenly are too good for everything.
