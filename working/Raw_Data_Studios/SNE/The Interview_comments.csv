*Soojee Pyo2* years ago (edited)
Uh, I am from South Korea, and while I myself laughed watching this trailer, I have to say you guys went WAY too far. First of all, Kim Jong-un is NOT President. He is an ABSOLUTE DCTATOR. His grandfather Kim Il Sung was the evil one who invaded the South and caused the Korean War. Here in the trailer, that's where it is said as Jong-Un saying ""yes, it was given to my grandfather by Stalin."" "" ""In America it's said Stallone."" Please don't laugh at that. And  Kim Jong-un is not a person to be fooled around with. He has thousands of his own people in concentration camps. You know the average amount of calories a person eats per day over there? 850!! Yes. 850!!! That's the standard of living over there. And don't take Jong-Un's words lightly. This movie makes him look like a stupid nerd. He is NOT!!!!  I am very sure South Koreans will not appreciate this movie, because they know about Kim Jong-Un. He is not a person to be used as a satire, just like Hitler wasn't. Many of you will say, ""hey lighten up, it's just a movie."" But you don't know the circumstances between North and South, or what's going on in North. You have gone way too far..",2017-07-09T22:19:14.000Z,1

1. This wasn't an official government approved propaganda film to poke fun at Kim Jong Un and try to provoke him.
2.

Free King James Bible - just click on my photo, then the link below. Friends, most people today aren't going to church any more. Even the Christians in the churches, many are not reading the King James version (it's important you use this one) Bible every day, trying to live their lives according to it, praying by the hour, not the minute, fasting, almsgiving, living lives of self denial. Our governments and political systems are a mess. The rich are generally selfish and not helping the poor, just trying to take over the whole world so they can make even more money. I don't think God is going to put up with this much longer. Jesus Christ said He would come back again, and I think it's near. It's time for all of us to repent because I don't think we have much time left. And will it be a rapture and a seven year tribulation as many of us have been taught for many years? Remember, that's just a theory. Jesus Himself taught that He would take up the children of the devil first and cast them into hell. then put the rest of us on a new earth He's bringing with Him.

I myself liked this movie and thought it was funny because it's a comedy. People need to step back and just accept its a comedy. If you don't want to see it don't see it. It's made for entertainment and if this is not your type of entertainment don't watch it. You're giving more publicity by making such a big deal out of something so small. yes the movie had its ""inappropriate and offensive"" moments. But a lot of comedies do.

Is like if you are in a group were they are making fun of the one that can explode in any moment, and you are too afraid to ask if it is right or wrong (I am not giving my opinion here if it is correct or not). So, North Korea HAS an army, but, you know what? U.S.A. ALSO has an army, an so do most of the powerful countries in the world. PLUS, the movie is just a movie, the real deal is behind it (if you are not aware of what am I talking about Google ""Sony hack"" or similar, you can also find a PDF in the official website, if you are interested in.) The content of the movie now doesn´t matter, what does is if it IS realised or banned, the people behind it, and the reactions.
You may think, ""Well, but we are talking about a Dictator! He can do whatever he wants to!"" Yes, and No. He IS a Dictator, and I am aware of what he and his family did and do to North Korea, but that doesn´t mean he is the king of the world. He can´t just make (for example) South Korea dissapear, becuase there are a LOT (as said before) of different countries out there with power (and no need of a dictatorship).
So, as a ""kind of"" conclusion: this is pulling a little bit too much (in my opinion) the MORAL situation of North Korea. But FISICALLY, there is a really big chance of nothing happening (which obviously do NOT take out the other chance).

2014-11-25T00:30:14.000Z,KpyVENBPj5c,The Interview Final Trailer - Meet Kim Jong-Un,"I find ""The Interview"" funny, especially with the line:"" The Leader of North Korea is a master manipulator of its people"". This is exact reflection of the US government way of manipulating of its own people. I can't decide just yet who is more naive. The people of North Korea or the people of the USA. Most likely both. Although I could be wrong. As Homer Simpson points out ""when you manage to fit 8 hours of television a day..."" you can't see propaganda being sold to you. Typical American way of selling propaganda to its people by trying to be funny while planning to assassinate yet another sovereign Leader of a foreign Nation. Same way as US government executed leader of Iraq Saddam Hussein, leader of Libya Muammar El Qaddafi and countless others who didn't want to dance to US government's music over the past 60 years or so.
Hopefully there will be (as I have no doubt there are some) few awakened Americans who have learned how to read between the lines and who are able to see this ""comedy"" for what it really is. 
And a true ""heroic"" Hollywood finish of the ""comedy"" with Kim Jong-un having his head blown off. How typical?! 
Overall it wasn't funny at all. Except of course the easiness of downloading and watching ""the interview"" for FREE. I thought that would be a bit harder to do in State of Texas. Especially because it was shown only in ""selected"" cinemas across the USA.",2014-12-30T12:15:53.000Z,0

Not only is North Korea hated by its own civilians but it's hated by its neighbors as well. The day that North Korea threatens any American right will be the day that America Wipes them off the face of the earth; The only reason it hasn't been done yet is because North Korea has an communist alliance with China.
North Korea knows they are no match for America(s) and her allies.

Will this movie begin World War iii (WW3)? probably not, but if it did, it would be the shortest war our planet has ever witnessed.

I'm pretty sure even Seth Rogen knew this thing was fucking garbage before it was even released. This is like The Purge, where the concept is interesting and everyone wants to see how they've done it, but the creators already know that that's why everyone is going to see it and figure they don't have the put any effort into it at all because hey, by the time the audience figures it out they'll already have paid for it.

Bland characters, scenes that go nowhere, casual racism, toilet humour, terrible pacing and character development, unrealistic bullshit, and about thirty different occasions where it makes you realise that it actually had potential if even just one person tried to give a shit about making this movie. If Kim sees the movie at all, chances are his reaction is most likely going to be him having a chuckle at the fact that there's people who are actually eating media like this up.",2014-12-28T20:59:01.000Z,0

If there is problem in north korea, nobody should make any movie that uses it or its leader as subject matter, especially not comedies. That would be racist. And any movie that I arbitrarily deem racist or unfit will justify acts of vandalism, suppression of free speech, and threats of terrorism.

And as the self-styled leader of Palestine (whatever that means), ""we"" shall send food or stuff to help them. Or maybe we could send them some of our Iranian-made rockets because random stockpiling of weapons and attacks upon non-combatants has worked miracles in solving hunger problems.

Congrats to the hackers who did stop this shity movie to get in theaters. (oops...I mean to say delayed the release of the movie by a week or less). Anyway, keep lighting those torches and burning those books! Today we achieve a 1 week delay, but that still means ""we"" are one step closer to making free speech illegal! Yay!

Wow.... all I can say is..... wow..... What talent...... syke. #1. Dumb idea, dumb movie, they might as well have used another head-of-state that didn't have 2 million soldiers at his beck and call, not to mention *POSSIBLE* nuclear warheads pointed toward Japan and the U.S. and it still would have been pretty much the same humor, if you find any that is, and, #2, This really means that any possibility of assassinating this terd bag in real life now seems strange, far-off and basically it can't happen, which is too bad. I haven't' seen the movie but I'm pretty sure they don't show scenes of starving North Korean children that die from illnesses that can be cured here with simple, cheap medicine you can buy in a pharmacy. They pay their military and atomic warfare ""bills"" before they feed their citizens, which is fucked up and a trademark of a communist society.

I thought it would just be short skits and scenes of them making fun of him. Yet the whole movie was around making fun of his character as well as an assassination plot. That to which was the basis of the movie. That would literally throw me off as well. I can see why he took offense to Americans saying this. It was as though inviting the need to start a war. Someone makes a movie about judging me.  Be it cruel or not, and saying you would kill me. Idk I would be flustered as well. 

I do not condone his violent acts on his people, so please do not try to spin what I'm saying. I'm saying as an individual or ruler. I just would not take kindly on a group of people or foreign nation in his hand. Stating even in satire that they would want to kill me. I can see why he stated those ridiculous terrorist threats. A lot of movies do satire like this a lot more tasteful. This was just downright..... Lets just say their approach was not properly laid out. They could of done a whole lot more to make it more appealing for the audience. ",2014-12-27T13:16:46.000Z,0

North Korea has more milirary power than what we give credit for. They posses nuclear weapons and most importantly they have desperation. With Prolonged poverty and social isolation they are not afraid to start the biggest and scariest war of the history. Since they are already starving to death they are willing to go to extremes.

And since when was it cool to mock other countries president publically and theatrically? Even though its NorthKorea the intentions behind the movie was immature and unmannered. Think about it. What if say China made a full movie making fun of our country and our president?? Its quite offensive indeed",2014-12-27T02:13:08.000Z,0

2014-11-25T00:30:14.000Z,KpyVENBPj5c,The Interview Final Trailer - Meet Kim Jong-Un,"This is a piece of shit movie that makes a comedy out of an evil regime that routinely executes its people for minor crimes, knowingly starves its citizens, and buys luxuries for its elite rather than fixing its economy. It reinforces racist stereotypes of a group people who have no choice in what their leaders do. But people are arguing freedom of speech for a movie that trivializes and makes a joke out of all of that. They are supporting the fact that over and over the media gets to come out with this stuff that makes North Korea the funny joke, that takes away from the reality of the situation because people would rather laugh about fatty Kim Jong Un and nukes and durrhurr than acknowledge that there is a country actively starving and executing its own people and that we do nothing about it. People are ignoring the fact that if any other country had done this about an American president, it would have been labelled propaganda, but because it’s American-made, it’s comedy.It breeds a generation of people who think North Korea is a joke rather than an issue.
Seeing it doesn’t make you a champion of freedom and doesn’t count as a brave act of defiance against a dictatorship.

Yes, North Korea has long been ruled by an eccentric dynasty of portly dictators with bad haircuts. Yes, the propaganda the regime regularly trumpets to shore up its cult of personality is largely ridiculous. And yes, we on the outside know better, and can take comfort in pointing fingers and chuckling at the regime’s foibles, but it takes no valor and costs precious little to joke about these things safely oceans away from North Korea’s reach. When a North Korean inmate in a political prison camp or a closely monitored Pyongyang apparatchik pokes fun at Kim Jong Un and the system he represents—that is an act of audacity. It very literally can cost the person’s life, and those of his or her family members. To pretend that punchlines from afar, even in the face of hollow North Korean threats, are righteous acts is nonsense.

The day will soon come when North Koreans are finally free, and liberated concentration camp survivors will have to learn that the world was more interested in the oddities of the oppressors than the torment of the oppressed. The Interview is a bad movie that trivializes one of the worst ongoing human rights violations on our planet right now, and its distribution, as integral as it is to our First Amendment rights, will change absolutely nothing.

Yeah, we all think it is funny (not really as I just watched the movie on Youtube) but I can assure you that Kim Jung-Un would not be amused, especially if this movie proves to be a big hit on the screens and internet. It will only prove to him that Americans are collectively giving him a big middle-finger and are thus collectively guilty of insulting him and his family. It then becomes PERSONAL. Since he doesn't give a shit about his countrymen, he may just decide to be the biggest SUICIDE BOMBER of all times order the missiles launched. Will Muricans still be laughing then?

Because of run away production I can no longer afford to go out to the movies like they used to.i  usually would  go to the movies at least 24 times a year . This year I have only gone 5 times.

There is simply too much garbage on the silver screen for me to waste my time on. So ""The Interview"" would not have been on my radar screen but for North Korea's terrorist threats and Hollywood liberals' being so shameless cowed by those threats.
One more reason to dislike North Korea: it caused me to lose two precious hours on a dump of garbage. It's not funny to have Rogan and Franco sophomorically arguing against each other endlessly about non-issues; it's just annoying.
The only thing approaching anything being funny is the movie routing Rogan to Northeast China through the Southwest of China, with the Guilin landscape in the background. It's the same as routing someone's flight to Boston from China all the way down to the Everglaze of Florida. 
The only people approaching anything likeable and believable are, ironically (and they make a big fuss about this word in the movie), Kim (Randall Park) and, much less so, his female media handler, Sook (Diana Bang). And, interestingly, Kim is the only person whose voice is not jarring to the ear.
""The Interview"" certainly reinforced my resolution not to waste another minute of my life on a bad movie. ",2014-12-25T20:06:14.000Z,0

MAYBE, if they had cast Sacha Baron Cohen as the interviewer (or Chech & Chong) he/they Might have saved the film.   I think Sony made up the whole Hack story, because they new the movie stunk and hoped (and they will now) to get their money back based on the publicity.   Also, unnecessary heavy usage of foul language and 4 letter words, that adds nothing to the film.  Definitely not for the under 18 children due to language.

And no, this stupid movie won't cause a war. Yes, they may have missiles that can reach to USA or whatever, and they can certainly INITIATE a war, but then what? They don't even have food to feed their soldiers to maintain a war more than a week. So they'll start a war over this movie? Come on. Mr Kim Coocoo and his entourage's utmost priority is to maintain their power, and in order to do so, they WON'T start a war to jeopardise it, especially with USA. So, calm down. They occasionally fire some cannons to South Korean territories when they need some attention to get some food. That's all.

1.Movie The Interview"" comes out about killing North Korea Leader
2.Sony gets threatened, shuts it down in theaters.
3. North Korea Internet is hacked, shut down.
4. Piratebay gets raided and shut down.
5 Sony announces the release of the movie ""The Interview"" for online streaming on theater release days.
6 Sony having maintenance on their PSN network right now as we speak exact time the interview is released.
7 News reports A Brooklyn judge cut loose a gang member who had posted online threats to gun down cops in the hours after two NYPD officers were executed in their patrol car — ignoring prosecutors’ pleas to keep him behind bars, The Post has learned.
8. Now Lizard Squad a fake hacking group is bragging as if they are the ones responsible for shutting these major networks down including xbox too now. LOL Oh my God this is getting comical and a complete obvious lie.

Do the fucking math people!
Bottom line ""The love of money is the root of all evil"" ALL EVIL
Not only is this about money this is about controlling the masses and doing a test run for online profit andf internet censorship.

With all the police brutality and the anger stirred up in millions of Americans they will use some gang members words on the internet to demonize everyone else who might say things out of anger or frustration.

 Sony is a part of this scheme. This internet release of the movie is also a test run on censorship in so many ways because something this big being released on the internet comes a plan to make sure people pay and sure enough Piratebay gets raided a couple weeks ago.

This is also a test run to see how many people will pay online for a theater release movie. A movie they fear may lose money on due to less people showing up to theaters and torrent file sharing. Sad these fucks are so greedy. they don't realize they wouldn't have lost much money in the theaters. IN fact because this movie struck so much controversy they may have gained more viewers in the theaters. And because of this being released online now with this controversy it's guaranteed to make historical amount of money more than likely and they will act like they have proven how much money they have been losing from piracy.
FUCKIN LIE. It is;
1. the controversy
2. xbox &sony hacked (lol ya rightl, not this time liars. How much you pay lizard squad to get away with criminal admission on twitter you lying scum bags)
3. The normal Convenience of staying at home and streaming alread
4.  and the excitement of being able to see theater release movie with that convenience
that will draw in record online amounts of money.

This was a scam nothing more and our government is in bed with these corporations just like antichirst obama was in bed with the automobile bailout and Bush's Clinton's got their hands in it as well.

The simple fact that piracy and piratebay plays such a huge role for these greedy fucking bastards we have to connect the dots and see who is really up to no good here. I'm putting my money now on SONY AND MICROSOFT bowing to the new laws going into place for internet censorship to silence the truth movement that exposes their lying asses.  Just like Microsoft needed apple years ago, and still do, now that the gaming streaming consoles are getting more popular & advanced we need to look at how Microsoft and Sony play a friendly role here just the same.

Lizard Squad is a dis info CIA funded project as far as I'm concerned to leech out any real threat to their globalist agenda to enslave a free society. Socialism/Communism at it's best coming to a town near you with militarized police uniforms now and more intimidation then you have ever seen. No thanks to punk thugs and gangsters rioting in the streets all you bastards should do a few in prison and it's sad you morons can't see how you are the ones they use to bring in the order. That's their motto ""order out of chaos"" ""and the racial war as well ""divide and conquer"" This entire ""Internet hacks"" is real but at the level they lie about is a complete joke. Their technology is so advanced it would sound kooky to even talk about some of it. All this is about is controlling the masses and making money while doing so.

Think about it, All of a sudden on the same day Sony decides to do maintenence on a holiday during hours everyone is playing they announce tonight the online streaming release of the Interview for xmas tomorrow. LOL Connect the dots people. This entire thing has been a complete scam from the start. Seeing how much money they could rake in online while cutting out middle men, theaters, licensing etc etc while also tempting torrent file sharing people to take a break and pay for an HD quality movie online tonight. This is a test run people., This is exactly why Sony PSN is down for maintenance

All of this happening as we speak.
LOL Shame on you Sony. Pathetic. I use to think you weren't as corrupt as Microsoft. Now I see you're just another player in this satanic corrupt system seeking to censor and control the internet/people.

Dont forget people. all these things I mentioned above are taking place today all in the nick of time to buy a movie online during the biggest holiday of the year and you dont even have to go to the theater now. Whats next? Google buys Sony seeing the one who controls the internet controls the world soon enough.",2014-12-25T04:23:05.000Z,0

Somebody tell me again why both the U.S and South Korea send substantial aid to North Korea, a country who threatens to bomb us both with nukes at least twice a year. Or why their leader who is supposed to hate America also seems obsessed with parts of our culture. I don't care how they feel in North Korea about this movie, but in America we pride ourselves on freedom of speech. We shouldn't have to sacrifice the ability to watch any comedic movie in the US because of their feelings which have been far from rational throughout their entire history. The more and more I look at it, the more North Korea reminds me of Imperial Japan with its fanatic loyalty to its leader, its inhumane cruelty (labor camps), and its neglect of most things unrelated to the military which in North Korea's case extends to not feeding its people. If this is an ""act of war"" like they claim I would sure love to see them act on it. Cause if they do China won't be helping and the U.S would crush North Korea  in the same manner as the Iraqi military who outnumber U.S forces in the invasion but suffered from a 170:1 kill to death ratio. The U.S has other issues to deal with (the whole fiasco in the middle east, internal issues etc), but if North Korea ever gave us a reason to jump them up to #1 on our ""problems to solve"" list, they will have hell to pay. ",2014-12-25T03:48:18.000Z,0

But people aren't that stupid anymore, they won't go to war without a very good reason to, even if you try to force them with conscription, most people would tell you to take a f*ckin hike.

However, I did not find it appropriate of them to write a movie like this now. In Some Like It Hot, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon's characters witness the St. Valentines Day Massacre of 1929. But the movie was made in 1959, so there is 30 years separating the movie and the actual events. If in 30 years this movie was released, this movie could have been rather extremely funny under any clause or still extremely disrespectful and uncalled for. What I'm saying is, they did not pick the right time to make this movie. And this movie makes all Americans look extremely ignorant to the cruelty happening in North Korea, and our military's part in it as well. ",2014-12-18T17:40:18.000Z,0

Are the lives of any one human on this earth worth THIS?

Do you truly believe that NK would risk losing everything they have to fight the West, yes the West not the USA because you sure know that if it ever happened, Europe would step in as well. Heck, i even believe China would betray Korea, the West is as important to China as water is to humans. China needs its exports, if it fought against the West they would most likely lose everything as well. Let's not forget Japan as well, another pain in the ass for the Koreans. They are completely surrounded, the West, South Korea and Japan. They would lose so no, a war won't happen. Just curious on what the Russians would do...

Overreaction is an understatement at what has happened but what can you expect from a delusional brainwashed country like NK? I feel for the poor folk who live there and can't get out, just wish all those stupid communists who run things over there would just get thrown to space and allow the NK people to be free. Unfortunately they have been brainwashed so badly that they believe if something like this happened, we (WW3 allies) were the bad guys. We just have to wait it out and see what happens, but i highly doubt that and people shouldn't worry because WW3 is not soon. At least not in the next 20 years, if it does happen it 'll be around 2060-80 when Petrol is out and we'll have the oil companies on a rockus and everyone fighting for it.

Wanna talk about ""stooping low"", look at the way North Korea is run, a big fucking baby who wants to feel superior and important to the extent that men can ONLY get certain haircuts, all of which resemble their dictator. 

Look up the conditions of prisons in North Korea. Prisoners often end up eating grass, dirt, and drinking their own piss to survive because so many die from beatings and starvation. 

A joke comedy about assassinating a piece of shit dictator is nothing. Look at how many movies there are about killing Hitler. There's a great example.

1. This movie was made by a BUSINESS, not the government. There are no laws against making a movie about killing a leader that is currently alive. It is a creative choice, not a political one.
2. North Korea does not seem to understand point #1, and even IF they were to attack a NATION because of what a few people at Sony believe (Which isn't an accurate representation of the entire population) they would not win because...
3. N.K does not have the ability to send a nuclear warhead across the Pacific. We would level the country within the hour.
4. The movies premier should NOT have been cancelled. This was a threat of terrorism, and we do not negotiate with terrorists. There wasn't even negotiating in this situation. They threatened, and America backed down.That not only portrays us as WEAK to N.K, but it also reinforces the notion that if you threaten someone/something, you will get what you want. Its rewarding a negative action in the same way giving a baby what it wants when it cries, just on a bigger scale.

Show the movie - nothing is going to happen.

It is incredibly racist, hurtful and also horrible in the fact that North Korea is a place of death, hate, and horror. Example one. Yeonmi Park. In North Korea, her friend's mother was executed for watching a Hollywood movie. The day she escaped North Korea, her mother was raped just to save her daughter. Her father died in China when they had escaped and she had to bury him at thirteen years old. In North Korea, there are camps where people are killed without a second thought. Example two. A North Korean survivor, name unknown. He told of a pregnant woman who had given birth in one of the camps. She was beaten for the baby's loud cries. She was then forced to drown her own child, her own flesh and blood. No, this movie is not funny, it is not humorous. This movie only shows that the North Korean's pain is only to be laughed at.

First of all, Kim Jong-un is NOT President. He is an ABSOLUTE DCTATOR. His grandfather Kim Il Sung was the evil one who invaded the South and caused the Korean War. Here in the trailer, that's where it is said as Jong-Un saying ""yes, it was given to my grandfather by Stalin."" "" ""In America it's said Stallone."" Please don't laugh at that. And  Kim Jong-un is not a person to be fooled around with. He has thousands of his own people in concentration camps. You know the average amount of calories a person eats per day over there? 850!! Yes. 850!!! That's the standard of living over there. And don't take Jong-Un's words lightly. This movie makes him look like a stupid nerd. He is NOT!!!!  I am very sure South Koreans will not appreciate this movie, because they know about Kim Jong-Un. He is not a person to be used as a satire, just like Hitler wasn't. Many of you will say, ""hey lighten up, it's just a movie."" But you don't know the circumstances between North and South, or what's going on in North. You have gone way too far..",2014-12-06T05:25:56.000Z,845

Do you think Kim Jong-Un is that bad of a person? I think not.....he detests America and all of it's allies for the many, many years of war crimes and instigating wars all over the world. Try reading a North Kkorea newspaper sometime, we are being told that exact opposite. The same follows Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, Bhutto and the many others that the American public was told are the axis of evil when in fact they are nice people. Fidel Castro sent all those people over here on boats because they were associated with the CIA, the CIA tried to ruin Cuba. Also we were being told that Chavez was an evil one and it turns out that was a lie....make reference to the film by Oliver Stone ""Across the Border"" For years our politicians have been embracing war criminals and the real axis of evil while at the same time telling us that the good people are the evil ones.
