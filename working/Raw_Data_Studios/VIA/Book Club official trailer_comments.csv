The makeup artist should have been fired; all of the female leads looked about 15-20  years older than they do in ""real life"" (don't get me started on Jane Fonda's hair color).",2019-08-17T19:10:41.000Z,0

This rubbish is tossed out there as light-hearted comedy but all I see are intelligent women being mocked.  The trailer alone makes me vomit and the last thing I would do is spend one dime to see this flick.  She's smart enough to be a judge but not smart enough to figure out her computer?  What an insult to every intelligent woman on the planet.  The whole script reinforces the idea that a woman can't possibly be whole without a man in her life.  It mocks older women, suggesting they are weak, stupid and desperate and must be look and dress a certain way in order to be acceptable to a man.

2018-03-02T08:00:41.000Z,LDxgPIsv6sY,Book Club (2018) - Official Trailer - Paramount Pictures,"I am torn about seeing it. I can already see it is problematic and yet I love the idea of a movie centered around showing how love and sex does not end at 50 or whatever age. You know what I mean? I dig the fact that they are showing older women as still relevant and sexual and 3 dimensional. I LOVE IT. And it does look entertaining. BUT....I have so many concerns. 1. Promoting that damn 50 shades of Grey book. YUCK. It has received enough damn attention and it's so problematic itself - not a true representation of BDSM and promotes an abusive relationship. 2. These are all white women/men. So over the all white casts of so many movies. Just when Hollywood makes some progress in diversity in some areas, they take two steps back on others. This movie could have included some POC easily but it doesn't. Yuck. Still torn. Could have also been nice to include LGBTQ in some way. I am trying to challenge myself as a cis white straight woman on what we see in media so I think about this stuff. I love they are tackling ageism here and I get that is the focus and that is ok.....just pointing out that it is possible to be more inclusive. Something like ageism is universal so it could easily be addressed with a more diverse cast.",2018-05-10T17:35:18.000Z,0

It would be so refreshing to see Diane Keaton ONCE be cast as something other than a blundering, neurotic mess, Candice Bergen as something different than the ""powerful sage,"" Mary Steenburgen as something other than the mouse who ""pipes up!"" every now and again, and for the love of Pete can Jane Fonda ever be anything other than the sassy, sex seeking missile?
I'm not saying it has to be high brow, but couldn't it just aim to not be THIS predictable?
And the men...Ha! As if any of the men cast in these roles would be dating women their own age!
Yes of course there are some men who date women their own age, but Don Johnson's character wouldn't be one of them...
And I'm not even saying that he'd be dating a 20 something because that isn't necessarily so, you can bet the woman would be in her 40's and at the most 50's, if he is supposed to be in his 70's.
And wait a minute; why are the women in the show supposed to be in their 70's, but the men are only in their 60's?
There's just no way, and so it sucks any hope of believability out of it.
Wanting more is just naive on my part because there is undoubtedly a large audience who will expect nothing more from it and won't care or notice that it is the same drivel they've been handed a hundred times before.
And MORE with the tired 50 shades ""naughtiness?""
A chance to advertise the franchise because probably the same studio.
This is why I'm a moron for ever expecting more from Hollywood.
