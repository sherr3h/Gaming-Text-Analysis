Rewatch this movie as many times as you like but you'll always find something new that you hadn't noticed before. for me, it was noticing how bored the guards looked while looking for the missing patient bc they've done this so many times before. ive never watched a movie that mindfucked me this much. i questioned my reality that i was living in and i ending up crying lmfaooo. definitely recommend to anyone who like psychological thrillers and plot twists.",2019-07-20T10:44:25.000Z,1

I might be totally wrong but what I understand is, the doctors were actually good, they really tried to help him and it worked. In the end, Andrew finally knew the truth but he pretended to be sick because he chose to ""die as a good man"" (he didn't want to accept the reality that he murdered his wife)
And probably after ""pretending"" for a long time, then he finally really forgot his identity again, since the doctor said that the experience also worked months ago but he regressed. It might be a repetition",2018-04-10T15:10:01.000Z,11

Read below to continue..



When he asked if its better to die as a good man or live as a monster and the way he came to the authority with no resistance and the look he gave when he quickly glanced at the bald doctor it was as if to say he was cured but he put on the act with dr Sheehan so Sheehan would think the role play was a failure. Reason for this is because he finally accepted reality and didn't want to go on as a monster so he preferred to die a good man, or at least have the brain surgery which would have either killed him or extracted the horrible memories. Living on in his past life as a Marshall was no longer an option because he knew it was a facade.

The experiment of role play worked, that's why he had to pretend it didn't, so they'd lobotomies or kill him but either way it's an end to laeddis' pain.",2017-07-23T05:24:58.000Z,2

2009-10-16T10:40:12.000Z,5iaYLCiq5RM,&quot;Shutter Island&quot; - Official Trailer [HD],"In my opinion, ""Shutter Island"" is a fitting title. Take the generic definition of ""shutter"" for example:

Shutter- each of a pair of hinged panels fixed inside or outside a window that can be closed for security or privacy or to keep out light.

Similarly, Shutter Island is private, isolated, and secure.  Viewers constantly question what the staff of the island is hiding throughout the movie. We suspect something sinister and dark, and the patients are ""shut inside"", unable to leave.

Also, ""shutter"" sounds a lot like ""shudder"".",2017-03-04T03:54:29.000Z,0

And then the men in the white clothes came to bring him to the beacon where they do all the experiments with Edwards brain.

I mean I don't even know what to believe myself but I guess that's the thing about this movie. We don't know what to believe anymore. This movie is literally brainwashing all of us! genius genius genius...",2016-07-14T06:46:43.000Z,132

2009-10-16T10:40:12.000Z,5iaYLCiq5RM,&quot;Shutter Island&quot; - Official Trailer [HD],"Such an amazing plot with a great twist.

I think DiCaprio did a great job playing the main character but I think his performance is better in other movies..

I am reading the book this movie is based on... reading it and I am still confused.


after watching the movie a 2nd time I decided i think Teddy was not insane the entire time.


I say this because I have encountered doctors who are NOT entirely honest with the patients who come for help.


doctors can be really bad people. you never know! some doctors don't give a DAMN if the patient really has an issue or not; it's only the huge salary they are after.


I believe the Rachel in the cave was indeed Teddy's imagination - it's simply not possible for a person to constantly hide here and there without getting caught, without getting help on an island where a mental hospital is situated. What would she eat? Drink? Both the movie and the book reveal how easily Teddy and Chuck were found regardless of where they were on the island.",2015-08-18T10:51:50.000Z,1

Ich habe noch Stunden nach dem ich ihn geschaut habe daran denken m√ºssen.
Die Macher von Shutter Island haben das echt gut hinbekommen.. 
Wie auf einmal alles einen Sinn macht wenn man ihn das zweite Mal sieht.
Wie man ihn dann auf einmal mit anderen Augen betrachtet. 
Und wenn man ihn das erste Mal gesehen hat, 
Mit zu erleben wie ein ""Verr√ºckter"" das alles erlebt. 
Und die Sicht von ihn verstehen kann. 
Der Film hat einen dazu gebracht selbst nicht akzeptieren zu wollen, dass Ted in Wirklichkeit Andrew ist.
Verr√ºckt (:

Teddy came to a realization that he had indeed created another identity for himself to relieve himself of the stress and guilt associated with his previous identity, Andrew. Due to the realization of his current situation Andrew decided to re-enact Teddy (his fake self) in order to be lobotomized, meaning he will be relieved of all memories etc. Why? Andrew had grown tired of fighting the memories that haunted him. The memory of his children whom were murdered by his beloved wife, Rachael. He decided he would rather be lobotomized in other words become a ""ghost"" (clean slate).",2014-04-26T05:02:08.000Z,0

The movie pulls you in with the mystery of the story,like a Monk episode.You have to follow each clue that the movie gives.To me those clues were:the impossibility of the escape,Di Caprios characters traumatic past and his dead wife appearing in his dreams soaking wet,but in actuality she died in a fire.

2009-10-16T10:40:12.000Z,5iaYLCiq5RM,&quot;Shutter Island&quot; - Official Trailer [HD],"One of the best movies ever.
Dicaprio deserves an oscar for each of his performance,fucking great actor.
I really respect him for trying so tough to overcome (successfully) his glorious physical appearance.
Each of his roles becomes a master piece because of his acting dynamic (which is simply unlimited).
For those who know him only as Jack Dawson i highly recommend you to watch all of his movies starting by ""What's eating Gilbert Grape"".
He is a legendary actor.-",2012-10-04T20:07:08.000Z,0

I think they really wanted us to think or to take or own conclutions about the film so I say Edward o Andrew wasn't wrong, but the thing is he just accept doctor's theory because he didn't know how to get outta there, they got him before he got them.

2009-10-16T10:40:12.000Z,5iaYLCiq5RM,&quot;Shutter Island&quot; - Official Trailer [HD],Read the book or see the film but don't do both becase as usual the book is better and it will make the film seem like less and like a summary. The book built a better tension. Maybe it would work to see the film first and then read the book but I don't think so because investing considerably more time than movie duration into something you already know the ending of doesn't seem like a good idea.    ,2012-06-07T14:31:10.000Z,0

He was hallucinating shit towards the end because of withdrawal.

They hoped that by failing to uncover his mind-control conspiracy, Andrew would see reality and return to it permanently. ",2011-12-13T05:35:07.000Z,0

but thats exactly the thing! you don't know if that is true or not. its also possible that teddy asked too many questions about the hospital's methods, so they made him think he had gone insane by making up a sotry about his past. they could have made chuck go crazy in order to affirm it. both plots have little elements in them that dont quite fit, like how chuck couldnt handle his gun, or the ""real"" rachel solando living in the cave. or how george nois was found!",2011-11-21T02:00:44.000Z,0

but at the end of the movie, you never actually know whether or not they were a real mental hospital that was trying to get teddy to admit he was insane, OR if what was happening in teddy's life (he was a cop called to the facility to find a mental patient) is actually true. so either teddys crazy, or the hospital staff are sickos. i hope this helps. you should read the book! its goo.d and it explains way more :)",2011-11-20T02:44:48.000Z,0

no, he knows exactly who he is even at the end, he fools the doctor (sheehan) he says something, he says ""Is it better to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"", therefore he decides to die cause he doesnt wanna live knowing what he's done, he doesnt wanna live knowing he's a monster. you can also see him checking the needle that theyre gonna kill him with out, & when he sees that they dont even have to tell him to come with them. basically he kills himself.",2011-02-02T16:58:34.000Z,0

However, Andrew is smart: When Dr. Sheehan sits with him on the steps that next morning, Andrew knows that the doctors and Warden are observing his behavior. ",2010-07-15T21:48:57.000Z,0

2009-10-16T10:40:12.000Z,5iaYLCiq5RM,&quot;Shutter Island&quot; - Official Trailer [HD],"@CrazyMcSwaggin  Maybe I should say SPOILER!!!

He DOESN'T realize he's crazy.  That's the point.  He goes ALONG with the Dr. to try and pacify THEM and we only know that at the very end when he and his sidekick (Dr.) are talking on the steps.  We only THEN see that he still doesn't believe in the reality.   That's my take on it.   As I said, it is a good movie but I just wish the author of the novel would fess up that he ""borrowed"" the plot from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.",2010-02-26T20:11:41.000Z,0
2009-10-16T10:40:12.000Z,5iaYLCiq5RM,&quot;Shutter Island&quot; - Official Trailer [HD],"@CrazyMcSwaggin  Here's some free advice.  Never watch a movie trailer if you're concerned about ruining a movie.  It WILL ruin it because you'll see all the images you shouldn't see and you'll never be able to watch it in an unbiased manner.  Don't blame me.  Blame the movie studios for making trailers.   Besides, it isn't two women investigating an insane asylum.  And you don't know if I'm lying or simply misinformed.  I could be wrong.  Or, I may have saved you 2 hrs of your life.",2010-02-26T08:10:53.000Z,0
2009-10-16T10:40:12.000Z,5iaYLCiq5RM,&quot;Shutter Island&quot; - Official Trailer [HD],"@Portis1Luv  ""irregardless"" is not a word.

So, let me understand what you're saying.  There is no such thing as plagiarism?  Is that what you're saying?  Everything is fair game to copy?  So, I can go out and make a movie where two women investigate an insane asylum and at the end we discover they never were investigators but inmates who made up their fantasies and I don't have to say based on shutter island and that's be perfectly fine with you?",2010-02-26T07:18:29.000Z,0
