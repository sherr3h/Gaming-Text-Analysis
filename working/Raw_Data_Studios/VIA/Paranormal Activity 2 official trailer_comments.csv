I've been scared by scenes in movies. But honestly, this movie wasn't scary @ all for me. I actually thought it sucked. Just having loud sounds when a door opens or closes, or when something hits sumthing doesn't make a movie scary. MayB 1 and 3 R much better, I dont know.

Okay, so, here's what you do:

forward this message on to five people
and hold your breath for thirty minutes. 

Next, you need to take a nice, sharp knife and lop off your genitals. 
Now you need to find a schoolbus full of corgis and blow it up.

Now think of your s/o's name and delete system 32.

If you do this literally NOTHING will happen, just like any chain letter.

Trust me I am not a stupid to know that this is another Blair witch flick ...However It burns me a new ass-hole to see Hollywood trying to sell us shit as if it is based on 
real events.

Hollywood producers....Blow me!!!

2010-06-30T14:00:17.000Z,07XbSk7Rjt4,&#39;Paranormal Activity 2&#39; Trailer,Anamarija good point but. In the paranormal activity I watched they didn't find her tha is because there is a rated and unrated version. The version you watched was when they possession went away but the cops got there to see her covered in Mika's blood so they shot her because she looked dangerous but that doesn't mean to say that the possession didn't come bak cause it probably did because this family where her friends in the movie Katie and Mika visit the family :‚Ä¢|,2011-01-05T21:49:15.000Z,0

For example, what happened to the girls mom? Did she go crazy or kill herself? And did she know about the demon? What happened when they were little girls? Why did their great grandmother gain from the deal she made? So many questions. But the good thing is that it answered SOME questions like why the demon was after them. But it opened up more questions, which can call for another movie.",2010-10-24T18:43:48.000Z,0

*WATCH THIS MOVIE IN A LITTLE THEATER. No kids of 16 years old yelling and barking around. It was too noisy.
*Try watching the movie without interupting(pause or something)

Other things I want to change in the movie are:
*In the last movie the time between the nights was PERFECT. In this movie everything is faster. I think Paranormal Activity is more about a story then the horror.

for all those wondering, the story from the first one is explained and is a sort of prequel! the dog is attacked but apparently doesnt die but as a cesure. The young girl survives but the other two die. And the girl from the first one gets fucked up and steals the baby! only one part is funny - wen the baby floats lol! x",2010-10-22T06:35:10.000Z,0

I like Asian horror as well, but I find that some of it puts too many extra bits and pieces into the story that don't really add anything overall, and others just take random turns. But overall it is the foreign and indie horror, rather than the Hollywood bits, that I tend to find more appealing. ",2010-10-19T08:52:53.000Z,0

As for applying what I said to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings you are taking it out of context. Paranormal Activity was marketed as a movie that used real footage, or at the very least was based on true events (which may still be true).  I don't believe paranormal activity is real, it was just marketed that way to create hype (which it did) and the fact they're making a sequel, to me seems like another cash in.",2010-08-31T22:20:57.000Z,0

Then everybody was in the mindset that it would be a really scary movie hence an overly scared reaction.

The problem with the first one was the hype. Everyone screaming 'scariest movie ever made' blablabla. Plus, the trailer was pretty cool, but gave all the good stuff away.

I think so, I mean... If you have a mirror and you change something in the mirror in opposition to the reality in front of it... I think they must have meant to do that, otherwise it's a real ghost.

Like me, I've watched TONS of horror movies, never once screamed, until Paranormal Activity came along. I thought it was scary, because I believe in that kind of stuff!
So fine if you don't get why people got scared at this one, cuz I have no idea how people got scared in like Halloween, Scream and that kind of movies.
