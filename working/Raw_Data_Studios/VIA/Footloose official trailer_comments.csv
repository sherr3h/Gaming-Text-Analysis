2011-08-18T22:59:44.000Z,EU6xHjVSMwk,Footloose - Official Trailer 2011 (HD),"To anyone wondering why the older version has a lower rating.

The older generations don't get online as much or care to go as far as to rate movies and etc. Younger people tend to be more apt to jump and get online as soon as they see a new film and give their opinion on it. The newer film appeals more to the younger generation because well.. it was released during their generation. So they naturally favor it.

In my opinion.. both kinda suck lol

But if I had to pick... The 1st had better music + acting.. üòâ",2018-05-11T01:29:35.000Z,1

It's like making a remake of Rocky IV today, where nobody would get the Cold War thing. Original Footloose is all about getting over the common sense of decency.
