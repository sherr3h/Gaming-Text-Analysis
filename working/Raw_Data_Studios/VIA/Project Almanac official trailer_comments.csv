I mean it is a time travel movie and everything involving David building time machine no matter how preposterous it may be looked interesting. Cgi was fine and found footage style didn't bother me. The characters had good chemistry and were believable as students. Everything was going well - them doing things like most of us would do, but then movie takes this really dumb middle school romantic turn and it just falls apart for the second half till the end. It became very dumb and shallow, plot holes appeared, dialogue became cheesy, lead female character became an idiot for some reason and time traveling just didn't make sense. I mean they establish somehow that is evil thing to time travel for your own benefit, but it is dumb. Of course that you would save your father or corrected some stuff in the past without remorse. So what if some stranger died in Brazil, life is unfair. In the end it is an entertaining film, you don't hate yourself for watching it but it is missed opportunity. 2/5",2015-06-21T12:22:56.000Z,1

Like, ""One day, I know my son will come back in time and I'll get to meet his future self"" and boom, it happens, and he even said ""I have so many questions"", I would have too.  The other thing I find crazy is that you could imagine, it's 2014, and you went back in time to 2004, holding things from 2014 and that's probably why the camera looked black and white when he did that final jump.  It's because back then, we didn't have upgraded technology in 2004 the way we have it now, so you'd expect the camera to glitch and have color problems. ",2015-05-20T17:04:07.000Z,1

POSSIBLE SPOILER
All this 2nd chance theme throughout the film seems like a clever twist on the basic time travelling genre, which many have played with over the last century....but since when can any time traveller, travel to a specific time era, twice or even thrice in a row; and not see his or her previous time travelling self......?......Exactly - Time travel is either linear or infinite or both - While Xmen Days of Future Past and Looper were both clever spins on the genre....this is a bloody disappointment",2015-02-28T05:03:45.000Z,0

If my theory is correct from watching the trailer...

From the looks of it, the guy drawing on his own face is the start of paradoxes that tears the world apart. I assume most characters die or are seriously injured from these types of paradoxes set off from the one original one; kinda like dominoes. The main character feels responsible for it all; his friends being hurt or killed and the end of the world pretty much so he feels the ony way to fix it all is to go back far enough to stop it from happening. He ends up in his childhood where he sees himself in the mirror, and realizes by trying to go back and fix his mistake it's basically creating how it all began. 

In trying to fix everything he's actually just created a fixed point from which it all started; him seeing himself in the mirror in the old footage which begins the movie. Kind of a loop in time. Makes me think it's destined to happen anyway. 

I haven't seen the movie so I could be very off or very close to being right. I just tried to put together everything from this trailer into reason. The face he makes at him self in the mirror is really what made me think this is what happened. He looks hopeless, terrified, beaten up and just completely done in the scene. 

Can't wait to watch it and see if I'm right!",2015-02-15T09:12:58.000Z,1

Aspiring inventor David Raskin (Jonny Weston) is admitted into MIT, but is unable to afford its tuition. Upon learning his mother, Kathy Raskin (Amy Landecker), is planning to sell the house, David enlists his sister Christina (Virginia Gardner) and his friends Adam Le (Allen Evangelista) and Quinn Goldberg (Sam Lerner) to go through the belongings of his father, Ben Raskin (Gary Weeks), an inventor who died in a car crash on David's 7th birthday, in the hope of finding something that David can use to get a scholarship. David ends up finding an old camera with a video recording of his birthday, in which he briefly spots his 17-year-old self in a reflection. The four later find the blueprints of a temporal relocation device that Ben was developing for the United States military, and use the available resources to build a functional time machine, including hydrogen canisters stolen from their school. David, Christina, Adam and Quinn later use the battery from the car of David's longtime crush, Jessie Pierce (Sofia Black D'Elia), who is attending a party in the neighborhood, to charge up the machine, and successfully send a toy car back in time. They end up being caught by Jessie and recruit her to their experiment, which they nickname ""Project Almanac.""

David, Jessie, Christina, Adam and Quinn eventually travel back in time to the day before and break into Quinn's house, where they draw a smiley face on the back of the neck of a sleeping past Quinn. However, he awakens and seeing his future self nearly erases them both from the timeline. The five agree to use the machine for personal gain on the condition that they always use it together. Adam uses it to win the lottery, Christina gets back at her bullies, Quinn aces a chemistry test to secure his academic future, and the group eventually decides to travel back to Lollapalooza three months previous. David hesitates to declare his feelings for Jessie, and decides to travel back in time alone to change that, leading to a future in which they are a couple. However, this creates a ripple effect that causes the school's star quarterback to have broken his leg and lose the championship, as well as a plane piloted by a classmate's father to have crashed, killing 77 people. David goes back alone once again and prevents the accident that would lead to the quarterback's injury, and averts the plane crash. He returns to the future to learn that instead Adam is in critical condition in the hospital after being run over.

Jessie confronts David, who is forced to admit to using the time machine to win her affection. They travel back in time together to rectify David's mistakes and save Adam, but Jessie ends up running into her past self and is erased from the timeline, causing an even more devastating ripple effect, leading to worldwide catastrophes. David decides to go back to his 7th birthday to prevent the machine from being created, but is confronted by the police, who suspect him of being connected to Jessie's disappearance. David escapes to his school to use a hydrogen canister to return to 2004, where he is accidentally caught on camera.

At the basement, David confronts Ben, who recognizes him and deduces that he'll eventually complete the machine. David convinces Ben of the machine's danger and they destroy the blueprints and a vital circuit together, before David is erased from the timeline. However, his camera is left behind and records the whole thing. Back in the future, David and Christina are once again going through their father's belongings, when they find the alternate David's camera with footage of them from minutes before. Later, at school, David approaches Jessie for the first time once again, displaying knowledge of the future, and confides in her that they're about to ""change the world.""",2015-01-31T15:31:01.000Z,1

BUT IF ALL THINGS IMPACT ON THEIR REAL UNIVERSE :
1:40
That's just not possible, the real moment where the paradox would happen is in the past (the moment where he is sleeping, not the moment where they're travelling and then drawing, because the paradox was already ""launched""), because, well, that the first moment where they did it, and every time travel have impact on the past ( ex : The smiley face on the neck and 0:27 )...

So what do you think ? ",2015-01-29T15:53:19.000Z,0

2014-11-18T23:20:55.000Z,ZALqGuwI_DE,Project Almanac Official Trailer #2 (2015) - Sci-Fi Movie HD,"This is my opinion/idea of time travel:
Think of the dimension of time as an infinite plane and imagine a line moving across the plane representing the flow of time, and to the right of the line is another parallel line representing an alternate flow of time but behind the first by the smallest unit of time. To the left of the first line is another line, this one a smallest unit ahead, and so the pattern continues infinitely on both sides. When travelling in time, if you go back then you would theoretically move not back but to the side, to the left, crossing perpendicularly through the lines into an alternate flow of time until you reach your destined point. When moving to the left of the theoretical plane you would be crossing over time flows where the past has already happened but without leaving the tangent of your time-universe, sort of like a rope on the doorknob. Then there's question of causing a butterfly effect. The two main opposite theories would state that, if you caused a butterfly effect, it would most likely effect the parallel flow of time you have entered, not your own. The other theory is that if you've crossed into another flow of time and done something with it then there would be no butterfly effect because, if you've done this, then that most likely means that an alternate version of you has travelled back in time (left) to your own original time flow, and that there might an infinite amount of alternate versions of you doing the same thing and you're just playing your part in another's time zone.
This is all purely speculation but what do you guys think about time travel?",2015-01-13T21:29:36.000Z,1

The future does not exist, so you can only go back in time, but once you back in time, you already changed the past. Let's say the time machine went back in time, in the original timeline there was no time machine entering the past, ergo you already changed time. Since you changed time, the timeline where no time machine went into the past is destroyed creating a new timeline. Since the timeline where the time machine went back in time is destroyed, the time machine was never even made. This would cause time to restart and resume at the the point the time machine went back in the past. This would cause time to resume normally. Time would fix itself! Since everything is normal and the timeline is back to normal. a time machine will go back in time and time will restart again. This will be a never ending loop dooming us all.

I also like the fact about time traveling is whenever you change something in the past that's part of the current time line, it creates an alternate time line, which this is what the characters don't realize what they've done until later on.",2015-01-11T22:47:35.000Z,0

There's some way of time travel,so i'll tell the details:
Timeline 1:Character asks out,fails
Timeline 2:Character asks out,succeeds

Timeline 1:Characters go to lottery,none are exact
Timeline 2:Characters go to lottery,5 are exact
Timeline 3:Characters go to lottery,all are exact

Timeline 1:Some girl spills drink
Timeline 2:Some girl spills drink,female main character gets payback
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline 1:Character fails class
Timeline 2:Characters succeeds class
-------------------------------------------------------
So,from what is seen,the effects of the time travel are:
-Some unknown riot
-A main character sees himself
-A plane crash that kills 77 people
-A presumed forest fire
-A main character is in the hopital
-A main character disappears altogether
-A main character shows up at 7th birthday

2014-11-18T23:20:55.000Z,ZALqGuwI_DE,Project Almanac Official Trailer #2 (2015) - Sci-Fi Movie HD,"It may be possible to find a loophole around the grandfather paradox, but just way too intricate to fathom. The alternate timeline theory is about as close as i can come. With this movie though, its a completely different paradox all together. One thing that struck me right away was the fact that the only reason they went back in time IN THE FIRST PLACE was because he saw himself on the home video. Ok so, how did he end up in the video if the only reason he went back in time was because he was in the video? It's a self-fulfilling paradox that absolutely cannot be possible. For example, the one in Back 2 The Future where Marty meets Goldie Wilson before he was the mayor and says, "" You're gonna be the mayor"". Then, Goldie gets this bright idea to run for mayor indicating that this was the only reason he became mayor to begin with. How is this possible when Marty never told Goldie anything when he became mayor the first time? Let's use a lottery theme as another example. 

Let's say that you're the type of person who NEVER plays the lottery, and I'm a time traveler. I tell you that I know the future, and you will win the lottery in one week. So you start to play the lottery and in exactly one week, just like i said, you win. I mean at first it makes sense because the idea sounds very reasonable, but its an impossibility. How am I able to tell you a future where you win the lotto, but this ""future"" will only exist because I told you about it. If i didn't say anything, then you never would have played. Thus, you never won the lottery for me to be able to come back in time and tell you that you will win.

So, if the ONLY reason why they decided to go back in time was because he saw himself in the home video, and them deciding to time travel is the reason hes even in the video in the first place...then how did he get in the video?

Gotta love time travel.",2014-12-29T11:12:39.000Z,1

2014-11-18T23:20:55.000Z,ZALqGuwI_DE,Project Almanac Official Trailer #2 (2015) - Sci-Fi Movie HD,"So from what i've seen:
There's some way of time travel,so i'll tell the details:
Timeline 1:Character asks out,fails
Timeline 2:Character asks out,succeeds
------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline 1:Characters go to lottery,none are exact
Timeline 2:Characters go to lottery,5 are exact
Timeline 3:Characters go to lottery,all are exact
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline 1:Some girl spills drink
Timeline 2:Some girl spills drink,female main character gets payback
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline 1:Character fails class
Timeline 2:Characters succeeds class
-------------------------------------------------------
So,from what is seen,the effects of the time travel are:
-Some unknown riot
-A main character sees himself
-A plane crash that kills 77 people
-A presumed forest fire
-A main character is in the hopital
-A main character disappears altogether
-A main character shows up at 7th birthday

The alternate timeline theory is about as close as i can come. With this movie though, its a completely different paradox all together. One thing that struck me right away was the fact that the only reason they went back in time IN THE FIRST PLACE was because he saw himself on the home video. Ok so, how did he end up in the video if the only reason he went back in time was because he was in the video? It's a self-fulfilling paradox that absolutely cannot be possible. For example, the one in Back 2 The Future where Marty meets Goldie Wilson before he was the mayor and says, "" You're gonna be the mayor"". Then, Goldie gets this bright idea to run for mayor indicating that this was the only reason he became mayor to begin with. How is this possible when Marty never told Goldie anything when he became mayor the first time? Let's use a lottery theme as another example. 

Let's say that you're the type of person who NEVER plays the lottery, and I'm a time traveler. I tell you that I know the future, and you will win the lottery in one week. So you start to play the lottery and in exactly one week, just like i said, you win. I mean at first it makes sense because the idea sounds very reasonable, but its an impossibility. How am I able to tell you a future where you win the lotto, but this ""future"" will only exist because I told you about it. If i didn't say anything, then you never would have played. Thus, you never won the lottery for me to be able to come back in time and tell you that you will win.

So, if the ONLY reason why they decided to go back in time was because he saw himself in the home video, and them deciding to time travel is the reason hes even in the video in the first place...then how did he get in the video?

Gotta love time travel.",2014-12-29T11:12:39.000Z,1

2014-11-18T23:20:55.000Z,ZALqGuwI_DE,Project Almanac Official Trailer #2 (2015) - Sci-Fi Movie HD,"If time travel was possible it would involve a static universe time line, not a dynamic one. That means that you can't change the past but you can travel to it. Imagine it as a closed loop that has to exist in the time line for some ""information"" (not peace of matter) that can not exist to start existing. ""Information"" in this case is a wide spread meaning that has no beginning and no end. Matter has a beginning and end cause of nuclear half-life decay. For example: you go to the attic of some old house and find an art peace (painting/music notes/something else) from some famous artist and in some weird coincidence you have a time machine. You go back in time with that piece of paper to meet that artist. That piece of paper is made of particles of matter which exist also in the past, and there is a big chance that those particles exist in the form of that same piece of paper you have with yourself. Now we have same matter at two places at the same time. You finally meet that artist and show him that piece of paper and he copies that information on to his piece of paper which is that same piece of paper you found in the attic. Years go by and he stores his piece of paper in his attic and you find it in the future. We now have a closed temporal causality loop which exists as a ""lump"" on fabric of time. It has no beginning or the end, it has to be there to enable that piece of information to exist. Another example of ""temporal information"" usage would be if for some reason you are stranded in a desert without fuel to start your time machine. You can decide to help yourself by temporal advantages. This will probably be somewhat difficult for some people to understand but let's say you make a decision that when you receive fuel from yourself from the future you will go home to get that same fuel and take it to the past to yourself in the desert. Thus you used a temporal causality loop to help yourself.
Another point of view if from energy view of the universe as a closed system. Energy is indestructible and can not be created out of nothing. Which means that the entire universe must be in balance with itself from any time point. If you go back to the past one week let's say. You increase the amount of energy and matter in the universe. It is the same energy and matter at two places at once now and that is something as an ""error"" to the universe and it will do whatever it can to fix itself, the universe is a living organism. It means that in one week at exact temporal point, younger version of you (same particles and energy) are going to leave the time line and go to the past one week and mass of the universe will be back to normal again. Which means that even before you decided to go a week to the past, two of you lived at once for a week at two different places at the same time.

Another type of time travel is that you can change the time line and create new universes. That theory is somewhat explainable from a point of view of intersected systems of parallel universes in which many universes share matter and energy. But I believe if that is the case you can not create nor destroy timelines. You are just an important factor to making some universes stable and existant. For example, you go back in time to kill hitler and save europe from ww2. That universe has those specific settings and another universe shared it's energy for something to exist in another universe, but that other universe and all other possible universe combinations in any given planc moment exist because they just exist. And they make a multiverse organism in which every universe is a ""cell"" with it's own function.

This is just my thoughts :)",2014-11-21T22:29:59.000Z,0

Imagine.
You watch a black cat running from one sidewalk to the other and suddenly getting killed by a truck.
After that you found a way saving the cat with *time travel*.
So you teleport to the beginning, but excactly there *you*, the one who went back, doesn't exist anymore.
Why?
The best example is... what if your past-selfe suddenly sees *you*?
At that point you no longer exist, because you changed your past selfe's actions and thoughts.
With this meeting maybe he wont come to the idea to time travel? And so he can't make the same decision as you did before and you are no longer existing any more.
New timeline. 
Now your past-selfe is the one who is writing the story... and at the end of the day he will only have a memory of a guy who looked just like him and disappeared at the moment he saw him...
and a black cat... that has been killed after that by a truck.
