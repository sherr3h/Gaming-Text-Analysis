2011-07-11T17:37:03.000Z,xz3j8gKRUTg,TINTIN Official Trailer # 2 [Spielberg],One of my favorite things about the original 2011 movie wasn‚Äôt even the movie but was the wii game for it the fact that it tells the story but in a different way a way without the main vilion but the side vilion as the main antagonist and one of the parts was the captain haddock side story/multiplayer post game which is one of my favorite modes so I really hope this remake gets that in hd for a new console and sparks the tintin movies back up (cause it ended in a cliffhanger),2019-10-18T04:04:46.000Z,0

I mean with Tintin it's obvious that it's animated but what about films like Avatar, King Kong, the Star Wars prequels, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc. And motion capture isn't used enough in films for them to make a category for it.

I know why Tintin didn't get nominated for the Oscars now, but it lost to Rango for almost everything.  At the VES awards, Tintin had THREE nominations out of the 5 for Outstanding Created Environment in an Animated film (have a look) and lost to Rango's Dirt Street.  I was so angry!  Rango beat Tintin at Best Character, Cinematography AND Best Animated film too. Oh well, at least it got some (not so big) awards... But if Herg√© was here, he'd be happy.

But When I saw this movie, 
I fell in love with it.
I Love Tintin to bits and peices now! ^-^
I read some comics, saw the episodes,
and ordered a plush of Tintin (the original
not the Beanie Baby one inspried by the movie)
And that ""We can't turn back. Not now. Not now....""
Gets me everything and I just melt...^-^

Beowulf was supposed to be partly real, partly cartoonish. Actually, I don't even know what the hell they were trying for with the animation in Beowulf. Zemeckis has been going downhill since Cast Away and that sucks.

Tin Tin is being made as a live-action cartoon, literally. It's a great, compelling story that could easily be done with obvious real life actors. But, this kind of animation kind of gives it a new spin, which is kind of cool, IMO.",2011-12-04T02:56:22.000Z,0

2. It's for the better. There's nothing wrong with it. Why don't you answer your own questions?
3. Yes, and Tintin was a great movie. What do you have against it? Actually take what I've said into account and tell me what's wrong with it.

Did you notice the Bird Bros had the EXACT same expression in every panel? No expression, no emotion, no sense of class even. Just a couple of crooks who stumbled on to something and thought ""Goody, money.""

You need to remember that this has all been adapted to suit the audience of a different medium, including an audience not entirely familiar with Tintin. The film has to appeal to everyone and some changes were made for the better.

really? so that means that all these years I was mistaken? I mean, in Portugal we use the french names (Milu, Dupond and Dupont, professor Tournesol, etc.) so I thought that those were changed from the original. Good to know that we actually had an accurate dub.
Still, this was done by Spielberg, a person from an english speaking country, so the english audiences do have the right for their dubbed names. Other countries will just dub with whichever name they gave the characters",2011-10-26T22:25:04.000Z,0

It was made into TV  show later which despite certain quirky traits, I remember rather fondly.

2011-07-11T17:37:03.000Z,xz3j8gKRUTg,TINTIN Official Trailer # 2 [Spielberg],"I can only think of one reason why those guys who want to do Tintin movies have to change things in the story every time. They must be unhappy about the work of Herge'. Do they really think they can improve things? If so they must be really stupid. It will probably be a good movie. But it will not be The secret of the unicorn as it is meant to be. Probably those who do not know much about Herge' and Tintin will appreciate it. But we, devoted fans wanted and expected a movie, true to Herge'",2011-09-06T15:20:50.000Z,0

All the previous attempts, animated or non animated have been disasters. Now as I watch the trailers of this upcoming one, I am sure it will be the best looking disaster when it comes to a Tintin movie. I am sure all fans can see that this movie mix everything up from The crab with the golden claws and The secret of the unicorn.

However, i won't judge it until i've seen the actual film. Then we'll know whether they've neglected him or not :)

In Red Rackhams Treasure Calculus plays a massive part, so why ditch him? God i hope he is in prisoners of the sun because in that one he gets kidnapped. ",2011-08-08T09:29:54.000Z,0

After all he makes his first appearance in the comics just before they set off for the Unicorn. Theres no footage in the film showing the actual trek for the real Unicorn, but rather only the contest for the model ship and the events of the Golden Crab.

2.  I'm guess they'll bring him out later since he wasn't that essential (apart from the awesome shark sub) in the Crystal Balls arc or the Moon Arc.
