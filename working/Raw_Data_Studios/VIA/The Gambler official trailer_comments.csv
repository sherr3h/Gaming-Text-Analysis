At no stage did i lose interest in what was going on and i thought the tension was palpable at times.
A really good leading performance from Mark Wahlberg and it's good to see Michael Kenneth Williams ( Omar Little from The Wire ) in a big role. If i had to be picky i would say that the three people who Jim owed money to could have been a little bit more menacing and the ending is a little bit confusing ( or that could just be me ! ).¬†
Overall though an entertaining , enjoyable movie.
