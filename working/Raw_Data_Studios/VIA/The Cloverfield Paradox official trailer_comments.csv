2018-02-09T16:00:03.000Z,jrxBaaINseI,THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX | Trailer [HD] | Netflix,"It's sad that this movie was criticized so harshly all because paramount took a perfectly good sci fi film and slapped the name ""cloverfield"" onto it. Reminder that this was what almost happened to ""A Quiet Place"". They almost claimed it as a cloverfield movie but decided on this one instead. If you watch it knowing it was not written with the intention of being a cloverfield movie, it's actually pretty good.


Edit: It also seemed very obvious that the original script was that when they unintentionally traveled to the alternate reality, they opened a breach which allowed this monster to reach their earth. That they were the cause for the attack. Very different from Cloverfield where it's an alien invasion.",2019-10-22T00:28:40.000Z,1

2018-02-09T16:00:03.000Z,jrxBaaINseI,THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX | Trailer [HD] | Netflix,"I was disappointed in the first Instalment "" Cloverfield "" because the Hand Held system of filming movies had & has been done to death & got old really fast...

I could've enjoyed the first movie if I was invested in the character's as to Why this is was happening rather than just running around trying to find one woman in a building collapsed onto the side of another building while this unknown creature trashing everything in its path...
It's not enough to have a creature feature with just the creature going about it's business without knowing Why as you don't route for the characters when you don't know what's at stake...

Don't get me wrong as I wasn't looking for all the answers to be shown in this first Instalment but to tell you nothing was just lazy, very much like the Hand Held mode it was shot in...

Now "" 10 Cloverfield Lane "" was a different case entirely & that movie didn't even show any alien beings til the end, as the heart of that story was set up with the 3 main characters tramped below in a bunker for their own safety & survival...
Even though it was a slow burner I think the Cloverfield franchise should've opened with this movie first...
The characters are just fleshed out enough for you to believe in them & how they ended up there but there's also enough within this movie to make you want to sit through until the end to see where it goes....

Now there's "" The Cloverfield Paradox "" which I haven't seen yet but from this trailer it looks like a head scratcher...
I'm not all for trailers that show too much footage but in this instance this trailer doesn't really make you want to take another journey into The Cloverfield mythology...

You never know I might end up enjoying it as I like movies that make me think but I err on the side of caution just incase this is a let down to the final episode of The Cloverfield franchise of films...

So sick of seeing that shit. What I really hate about the ""Cloverfield"" movies is that the women are always SO super submissive. They're always like emotional and crying and docile, while the guys are in charge and much more levelheaded in comparison. Even in this third movie, it starts out with the woman being like ""oh gosh, no, I wouldn't want to take this career opportunity because I want to stay here with you..."" because you know, you should always give up your career for a man... yeah wake me up if they ever, ever show a guy in a movie crying the same way and saying ""oh gosh no, I can't take this career opportunity, because I want to stay here with you instead..."" - then the fucking man tells her ""no you need to go"" and she like docilely says ""oh goodness gosh do you think so? Well, maybe I'll do it since you told me to..."" 

And another thing that I fucking hate so much about this film series is that they ALWAYS fucking start out with completely gratuitous shots of women being mostly naked-- always women of course, never guys-- FUCK them and their gratuitous, degrading, completely unnecessary depictions of women as sex objects in these films, not everyone watching is a horny prepubescent boy, and of course they never depict guys the same way. Fuck you, I'm not here to see a porno for little boys, I came here because I was told that it was meant to be a movie with an interesting plot. Well it's too bad that these films are always so fantastically insulting to female audiences that it's very hard for me to make it through to anything actually remotely thought-provoking. I fucking hate the entire way they present women, always as completely docile, submissive, gratuitously naked girly girls. Fuck you. Of course they never depict males the same way. 

Oh, and of course - since in the last film they decided to make a woman an astronaut, they just HAD to make her husband AN IMPORTANT BRILLIANT DOCTOR, becuase you know-- it's fine if the man has some distinguished career and the woman is a homemaker or something, but if the woman happens to have a distinguished career then OF COURSE they can't have the guy not also be distinguished! FUCK YOU AND YOUR DOUBLE STANDARDS. And then ofc they have to make the woman be extremely, extremely submissive in personality, as if to ""make up"" for the fact that the poor, poor male audiences are being made to endure watching a woman actually have a distinguished career. (""We're sorry that she actually managed to accomplish something! But don't worry, she's a complete docile doormat, see? We hope you forgive us..."")",2018-12-10T07:43:19.000Z,1

Only china speaks chinese and for some reasons, all they crew members are able speak in chinese with her, only with her! Ofc it sounded horrible since all the actors had to change some part of their their script in chinese for this chinese crew member! What a special snowflake!  The chinese actress btw. can speak perfectly english but I guess once again, china wanted to show off their ""proud of our culture"" childish shit and did use their long, rich and manipulative arms, to change the content for their own favor! 

""china must be special"" bla bal bla....

The negative power of the CCP reached a point of absurdity! Not only in this movie but in many other Hollywood movies as well, you can see, strong chinese propaganda and product placement. Everthing for their chinese communist startegy to....",2018-06-25T19:38:41.000Z,0

How long before your fans see you for what you are???

You are a plagarist.

Nothing you make is creative or original.

You not only copy other peoples work...

You also copy other directors approach to filiming.

So thanks for copying SW eposode 7... Looking forward to not seeing your ripoff episode 9.

As for Cloverfield Paradox...

It was like you wanted to be M. Night Shamalan in this film...

Instead you landed on being Rian Johnson for this turd of a film...

You set up mysteries with no payoff, and when the film ended, it made no purpose for the film to exist.

Maybe if you just made all 3 Cloverfield films into one cohesive story, then it could make sense...

But that's not your style, JJ.

The original Cloverfield is Godzilla filmed like it's the Blair Witch Project.

Cloverfield Lane was nothing but a big mystery in a bunker with no payoffs...

Cloverfield Paradox is sci-fi vomit... Every trope and cliche included with no payoffs. The film ends right where the original started...

The Russian was angry and crazy and died first, the Asian was so racist they refused to speak English and died second, the English white man was fun but died third so it didn't seem racist, the Americans were black so they feel good about themselves being ""Multicultural"", the German is smart but a traitor to all but his own, the ""Brown"" guy had a weak pointless role and died in a pathetic way, The Australian was a ghostly enigma with the only common sense but the American fucked them over for their own morality and justified it because they are American just because they have to be correct but couldn't see they were wrong until it was too late.

The movie is fine: B+ for a SiFi movie.
Couple of things of a general nature:
1. The technologies and cooperation seems so great, evidently the Earth was able to build in the space so huge and powerful station, with such electric and biological and etc. technologies, but could not solve the energy deficiency and (almost) went to a war?
2. Non of the scientists seems get through psychological, emotional and compatibility tests.
3. In addition, clearly non of the scientists have watched this or similar movies, so they were completely not ready to what happened. I would expect the captain having a manual with a description of different scenarios.

I felt like this probably because I binged watch the three films and the first one got my attention the most because it was focused more on the incident, then the next two is kinda, out there? They felt like spin offs than sequels. What I'm saying is, we need more Clover(the monster).

2018-02-09T16:00:03.000Z,jrxBaaINseI,THE CLOVERFIELD PARADOX | Trailer [HD] | Netflix,"Here’s my theory of how each movie connects with info from each ARG and each film
Earth 1 (the Cloverfield paradox’s Earth)
2018
- Energy crisis is its early years
- Tagruato helps out by selling portable phone chargers and announcing the CEI (cloverfield energy initiative)
- Uni professor Mark Stambler brother of Howard Stambler receives cryptic messages from his future self telling him to write about his book before the CEI begins so that he can stop the paradox in the future
- Mark doesn’t listen
2026
- energy crisis is becoming hostile and an energy war is brewing among nations
- cloverfield station has completed construction in space and the CEI has begun
- Mark realises finally realises what the CEI could mean for the world so he starts to write a book called “the cloverfield paradox” but he knows deep down it’s too late
2028
- Mark has taken his story to the media in an effort to make Tagruato abort the mission
- the crew of Cloverfield station make the particle accelerator overload and they vanish

Paradox changes to earth 1
- Multiple clover monster eggs are planted in the ocean thousands of years ago by aliens
2007 
- Tagruato discover the eggs on the Atlantic Ocean and harvest the sea bed necter for slusho which makes you automatically feel happy
2008
- The monster doesn’t hatch and Tagruato keeps on harvesting the rest of the eggs for the next 2 decades
2028
- All eggs hatch in a chain reaction from the Atlantic Ocean and they attack the city some are huge and have darker skin while others are smaller and have white skin
- Mark stambler makes videos and sends them back in time (remember it’s 2028 we’re pretty advanced at this point) to his younger self in hopes that he can prevent the CEI
- After a couple hours of the eggs hatching cloverfield station reappears and the soul survivors take the escape shuttle home only to be consumed by the monsters

Earth 2 (10 cloverfield lane’s earth) 
- this earth is under the same circumstances as the first earth but when the paradox occurs different events happen
Paradox changes to earth 2
- Thousands of years ago the aliens didn’t plant there eggs under the ocean they instead left earth afraid that life could develop and threaten their dimension or there monsters if they hatched
1980s
- Howard Stambler discovers an unidentifiable object in outer space whilst he’s trying to spy on communists
2008
- Howard’s wife and daughter leave him and he pursues his search for the unidentifiable object
2009
- Howard joins Tagruatos subsidiary Bold futura
- In his time at Bold futura he finds out that what he saw was an alien spacecraft and they’ve been waiting to invade and attack earth when we’re at our most vulnerable point
2016
- Multiple cities in America and around the world face a power outage due to the energy crisis
- Howard try’s to contact his daughter Megan online to get her to come stay with him in his bunker when the aliens arrive
- Michelle leaves her boyfriend which leads to the events of 10 cloverfield lane. 
2018 - 2026
- The world wide energy crisis worsens
- The aliens have engaged even more
- Tagruato launches the CEI
2028
- The shepard has landed back on earth and is powering the world and aliens are dying
- Jensen teleports from earth 2 onto the earth 1 cloverfield station and in the process gets stuck in the walls of the station
- The reason Jensen didn’t want the earth 1 cloverfield station to leave Is because it could mess with her world more and mess up there whole plan to get rid of the aliens.
Earth 3 (first cloverfield movie’s earth)
- this earth is the same as the first and second earth but with no energy crisis or at least none that we know of yet because the paradox instead causes events to occur in 2008
Paradox changes to earth 3
- Much like the changes to earth 1, thousands of years ago the aliens came to earth and planted there nest of clover monster eggs
2007
- Tagruato discovers one of the clover monster eggs and builds chuai station around it
2008
- The monster awakens and destroys chuai station
- Tagruato gets there subsidiary company Bold futura to crash there satelite in the Atlantic Ocean so that when they issue a search for it they can use it as cover to look for the monster
- The monster attacks New York City
- All caught on video
- The army eventually do kill the clover monster with nukes despite the ‘its still alive’ at the end of the movie
- There could be more that hatched later on but right now that’s where the story for this dimension ends
