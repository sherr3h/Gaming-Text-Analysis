I miss the very unique, quirky appearance of Renee. She was quite endearing to so many exactly as she was. It saddens me that she felt the need to make such dramatic changes. I couldn't finish What/If because I felt the role was beneath her and the writers failed on so many levels. I'm sure the younger generation will accept her, I'll hold on to films from the past which were either funny, heartwarming or made me happy to be unique myself.",2019-05-26T18:46:49.000Z,1

2016-08-17T15:09:14.000Z,PltWQ8kQe04,Same Kind of Different as Me Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Greg Kinnear Movie,"For those already bombarded with more overt racism than usual, which agonizes a man like hell tempting God, this movie is a modern depiction of back door slave meets front door richies, but with reason. The movie shows how, for centuries, blacks were met with resistance, for liberties, just like the slave who died in 2012 about whom this movie depicts, and how blacks could be systematically kept in the dark about free access to literacy which resulted in illiterate blacks who still exists today. This is juxtaposed to white descendants being unable, and/or unwilling, to see the disparity through the lenses of their generational access to tired old privileges and daily strifes.The takeaway message is to show how old racist constructs, created by strategic whites, has kept racism current. Moreover, racism is exasperated when oblivious whites make assumptions which attack blacks, by assuming blacks have the exact choices as whites to improve, without any resolve for the obvious hate induced inequalities made possible by other whites who they can't speak for. The latter includes racist whites always finding a way to supercede the inherent rights of blacks, by denying blacks equal access to American states, even today. The fact that racist whites tried to manipulate the language of Human Rights to insinuate that a white way of life is to be without black people, just to step on another's Human Right to be anywhere in his country, shows both hatred and white privilege at its peak, because this just doesn't stand as an inherent Human Right. So, whites need to own up to their racist white counterparts.",2019-03-15T14:27:32.000Z,1

2016-08-17T15:09:14.000Z,PltWQ8kQe04,Same Kind of Different as Me Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Greg Kinnear Movie,"Mr. Warren Cole Smith from BreakPoint.org wrote ""A Case Study in Faith Based Fiml-Makers"" after this movie's 1s week in the box office. He addressed many factors of why it was, essentially, a flop (not his words). He said it requires a LOT of good things to occure to be a true box office hit. His perception was focused on production/directing/advertising/etc, and praised all the great actors on board. There is a MAJOR ""good thing""  left out of your evaluation Mr. Smith. The ""Renee Zellweger's New Face Factor"".  Did it occur to anyone that if you want to draw in a Christian crowd to a movie, that using your PRIMARY actress who is still perplexing fans trying to understand her major optional body modification which could keep them from wanting to empty their ""date night of the month"" funds from their wallet? There large masses of faith societies that believe a tattoo, marking of the skin, is against God's wishes. There are also large masses that think purely optional plastic surgery, changing who God made you to be, perfect in every way in His eyes, can cause the masses to pull back and not want to send a message of strong support of that? Renee Zellweger, to many people (of any, or no faith) used to look just perfectly great! Her personality matched her face, as did her voice. She was adorably beautiful. She was  perceived to be 100% connected to her role/character whether it was dramatic in Cold Mountain, or sexy and sultry in Chicago, or witty and charming in Up with Love or Bridget J.!  Personally, I'm SAD that something inside her drove her to want a new face. She literally looks like a different person. It's been said for years now since she did this. What was wrong with her old face according to Renee. That is what we don't know, and can't grasp. She now looks like a person who may have a distant demeanor. They cut away her CHARM that you could see in a glance. Now to find her charm, she needs to unveil it layer by layer. Her CHOICE. NOTHING wrong with it! She does have to accept any outcome of it though. Previous die hard fans may find her unrelatable now. I don't know. I can't watch her without wondering what kind of scars or issues she had from having her previous face. So when you talk about 100's ""of things that have to go 'good'"", THAT is one of the things that didn't go well, it wasn't a positive. Likely, they could have used ANY really good unknown actress to debut, ""..and introducing Yister Blue as _leading lady_"" and they would have had at least the same outcome for this movie. Because I do not think Renee Zellweger was a draw. She is a GREAT actress. But she has lost a huge amount of fans. Perhaps someone NEW may have sold MORE tickets. Maybe a significant section of the intended audience refused to support her decision and would have seen it with an unknown in her place.",2018-09-18T07:36:08.000Z,0

I see your point in this.. claim that they are a lot ""white hero saves a poor black man"" motives in the movies. But instead of only blabbering.. (complaining)- do something about it. So you want a cool movie? What kind of.. which genre? For whom to watch? A war movie? Does it includes only black people (again.. why?). If based on real  story- do your research.. for whom do you want a movie exactly. A person? Someone as great as Rosa Parks (but who actually isn't famous and got buried in history). Choose somebody whose name is unknown and remind everyone his/her heroism. After that start writing to studious, writers.. make a petition even.. we.. would like a movie about.. the great (afro-?)american hero .... , about his war with.. we would like it to be done that way.. reasons.. etc.. etc. You could even try fishing for famous black directors and actors... maybe some of them agree with your point of view and would like to help you.. then about production? Who would like helping and advertising? If you don't like the current conditions- change it somehow. Request the help of people who could actually help you. Convince them to do so.. (with no agresive methods). Fight for your movie with a style, with your brain and with choosing the right words.. why not? Everyone can just trow words at someone else's work. If you don't like it-  fight for the thing that you would like to see. Speak with people!",2016-08-17T16:44:42.000Z,7
