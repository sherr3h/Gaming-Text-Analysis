2012-03-28T17:00:48.000Z,aPLiBxhoug0,Rise of the Guardians: Official Trailer,"Okay, Dreamworks is clearly losing against their competitors. Maybe not in money terms, but certainly in reputation and respect. I remember when they used to be renowned for their snarky, sarcastic, kids AND adults targeted movies. Kids would love it, but so would the adults. With Disney, yes it's there, but it wasn't as prominent with both targets. Clearly, Dreamworks is losing that streak. Trolls was the biggest proof of this. A by-the-book kids movie. Predictable plot, nearly one-note characters (except for the main two characters), and a juke box musical. Their last movie that striked both adults and kids like they used to was Kung Fu Panda 3. Well, even though the people want something original, they could start off with something a little more simple than a completely 100% original concept. Like Rise of the Guardians 2. It's what a lot of people want and the characters are still memorable, (although Tooth could use a little more development), and it has animation that has still not been topped by any of your other movies. And you now know what to fix. The clunky writing, the mainly kids targeted plot and humor, and some more development for some characters. It's a redeeming chance. You could even rework it to have that orignal snarky, and sarcastic attitude that we saw more with Bunny and Jack, and bring it to some other characters.

And I know they won't ever see this, but it's nice to get it off my chest. I know they're just gonna keep pandering to focus groups and the masse. 

But seriously, who misses the old Dreamworks?",2017-03-05T19:56:43.000Z,138

I hated how the Guardians blamed Jack for going after his memories. Of course he screwed it up, but he had been alone for 300 years without ANY answer coming from the Man in the Moon. Children have always believed in all of them and they don't know how does it feel to be totally ignored like he actually does.

The fear and pain in Bunny's face when he realizes he's invisible is only 0,01% of the torment Jack's been supporting.

-I don't understand this question fully but Sandman was resurrected by the children touching and sort of 're-purifying' the sand that Pitch tainted.
- Well, Sandman was taken out quite early on and before children of the world stopped believing. And I think once he brought them dreams again, they started to believe because it was mentioned by Cupcake (I think) that all they had now where nightmares.

Dear Dreamworks, 
This is how you should be making your movie trailers by making them something exciting and worth watching instead of putting every pop culture reference and bad joke you can into them. In other words, this made me get tingles. if you dont know, i havent had that same sensation since the dark knight rises trailer. If you continue to go into this direction you may one day pass PIXAR in animation and storytelling. please take a hint. 

sincerely,
