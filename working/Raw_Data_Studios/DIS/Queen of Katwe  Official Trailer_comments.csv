Now to reply to those comments below. I have been in Uganda 5 times. Amazing place, an amazing culture, its a place you will always wanna visit over and over again. I adapted to their way of living, learnt one of their language Kiganda which they very much use in the movie. They speak English everywhere especially the youth and I mean everywhere even in the villages. It is so full of life. Happiness comes from within, they truly know how to keep it at its best. That place is just full of life, worth visiting especially if you wanna cleanse your soul.

For those tourist maniacs, You will get way way way way way more than you need. Plus weekends don't exist there. The party life is so incomparable to anywhere in the world and I have been to lots of places. So party till you die, just make sure you pick you grave before hitting the maniac button.",2018-07-02T20:58:10.000Z,0

Phiona lives poorly with her mother, and her younger brother Richard. Her mom's enemy, Night, who is also Phiona's sister, hangs out with a man named Theo, who is seen as a bad character. Phiona walks and stumbles upon a playgroup that specializes in chess. When the teacher, Robert, notices her standing outside, he invites her. She kept coming, where she even got fed. Phiona was treated badly by the other kids by how bad she smelled,  but hung around to learn not to play chess. She soon discovered that she was slowly devoting her life to chess. She began to play more games and beat the #1 player in the playgroup. She continues to play, and beats everyone she plays with. She gets entered into contests with older kids, until she was to be found at a worldwide serious match of chess. Phiona tries hard to beat the enemy and ends up losing. She then starts to regret everything. She runs outside in the snow and cries. Robert comes outside and comforts her. ""I acted too soon, you were not ready."" He said. When they arrived back home, she starts to get more practice. When she gathers her courage, she goes to another contest, with a full grown adult from Russia, who she managed to somehow beat. Everyone cheered. Back at home, the next day a gloomy storm ran over Uganda. Harriet (Phiona's mom) had unknowingly asked Night to watch over Richsrd while she ran a few errands. The storm flooded the streets about 3 feet up. Richard remained on a hammock, screaming for help. Harriet runs in to save a Richard. When she meets Night, Night confesses she was out with Theo. Then Phiona came along. Harriet and Night fought for good 5 minutes until Night exclaimed ""I'm pregnant."". The next days after, every house was destroyed, causing Phiona and her family to live on the streets again. As for Phiona, she never gave up. She kept winning against others, and every time she won, she got some sort of money. That brought Harriet to buy a house for the family. Then, after that happened, Phiona became greedy, she got her hair done every time she got an award and she was too lazy to do anything. Robert confronted her. ""You must get up"" he commanded. Phiona listened. She did not like her greedy self either, but she had fallen into that hole. She began to quickly change. Night had her baby, and after doing loads of praying to the gods, her and Harriet became friendly. Everyone became friends.",2017-11-05T20:54:41.000Z,1

There is so much more to the history of the black African peoples of the world,...there are awesome stories encapsulated in the history of black empires such as Ghana, Songhay, Mali, Ashanti, Benin, Oyo, and Kongo,...and more for any of you who know much about precolonial African history. Why hasn't the story of Mansa Musa, Sundiata Keita, or Osei Tutu ever been portrayed on film,....or any of the Egyptian Pharaohs being portrayed as black, you never see blacks trying to portray border world Mediterranean Greeks or Romans.",2016-12-23T17:22:04.000Z,0

 people cancer and to shit on intellectual whites. I am 100% sure this movie
 was made only to launder money to the Clintons, there is no way that a

kid that sat on the bench eating miracle whip while the other kids 
played kickball, and this is his sick twisted way of getting revenge on 
those kids by making their kids watch this piece of garbage? I 
accidentally let my dachshund view a short portion of this filth, and 
now it works for Air Bud entertainment. Lupita, how did you stoop
 so low? You were a slave and now you're a fat 
out of work actor that can't even raise money on kickstarter and has to 
go to its shitty knockoff indiegogo to get paid for this deplorable 
piece of waste. You should have died when you got caught drinking and 
driving so we would have a piece of you to look back fondly upon, now 
all your fans see is a fat actor that can't even star in a real movie. 
Shame on you Luzika and everyone else involved in this 
trainwreck, I hope you all never find work again, and your families 
recognize you as the sub human fecal matter that you are.",2016-10-07T10:04:07.000Z,1

I won't lie, I sometimes find it insulting that every time someone does an African movie they tend to portray us as totally poverty stricken animals and leave out the beautiful parts of Africa. But I'm not going to be too blind to see what this movie was aimed at achieving and how there are actually a lot of stories like this (starting from the slums into success) in Africa. 
The The creator is Ugandan, the girl actor is Ugandan, the director has lived in Uganda for 27 years and it's a true story about a Ugandan girl; that's as original and real as it gets.",2016-09-22T07:11:04.000Z,6

I moved in Africa 2 years ago and this is not how everyone is living. People that never been there think we all live like this, in the middle of the savanna and animals, with these kind of houses. But no they're wrong but that's how it's represented and also it's due to stereotypes. I think they could've change this mentally by filming in the capital or a big city where there's actually buildings, restaurants and lots of thing you can as well see in America.",2016-09-22T00:01:44.000Z,1
