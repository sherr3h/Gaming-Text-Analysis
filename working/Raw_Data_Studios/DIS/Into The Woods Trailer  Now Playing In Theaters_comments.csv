The first half of the movie was absolutely amazing... Beautiful songs, nice story, I like the way it all intertwined.

In the middle there is a part where every1 is happy and honestly, they should have left it there.

The second half was very dark, sorta chaotic and unnecessary!

The film is horrible. Sure, it takes a darker route and follows the original tales more faithfully (like having Cinderella's sisters chop off their legs so they may fit in the shoe) but the ending was just plain horrible. It basically closes with a relatively happy ending for a bunch of murderers. Jack is the one who steals both 5 golden coins and a golden egg from the giants in the sky, and the giants let him get away with it, and then he goes back up and also steals the golden harp, then the giant decides to act so Jack practically murders him. And not only that, then the giant's wife also gets down to Earth to claim justice for her husband's death and she gets murdered by Jack as well, with the assistance of Red Riding Hood and Cinderella.

2014-11-06T08:01:04.000Z,2Byk9Is3TjY,Into The Woods Trailer - Now Playing In Theaters!,"I just reached an epiphany on the philosophy of the movie: The importance of going out, taking risks, and learning from your mistakes/experiences. Even though Red got eaten, and had to be saved, she appreciated her experiences, deviating from the path, and then started walking with a knife. Rapunzel snuck around, and learned that she could love someone more than she did her ""mother"", and that the way her mother showed her love, wasn't healthy. The boy was supposed to simply sell the cow for money, but he instead bought a magic bean story, that turned out to be true, and gave him enjoyment, for a while, before everything went to shit. The witch was in strict pursuit of good looks, but even after she got them, learning that she'd just lost her daughter's love, due to neglecting her happiness for all those years, was enough to make her go mad. Cinderella discovered love, but also betrayal, strength, and independence. The Baker's wife goes and acknowledges that she may desire someone other than her husband. The Baker's misadventures lead him to forgiving in his father, and forming an instant family.",2016-12-23T14:53:46.000Z,90

Not that the movie strayed too much from the plot, but put some deleted songs back in abs keep the mysterious man and Rapunzel's daughter. This actually happened twice. Annie and Bye Bye Birdie had theatrical movies that strayed from the original shows then they were both remade for TV and those movies were more similar to the shows. There could be a commercial break after Ever After. I kind of would also like to see it as a live tv musical like Sound of Music and Grease and etc. I'd sort of like to see Jane Lynch as the witch or maybe even Kristen Chenoweth, but she's playing Velma NBC's Hairspray and no one (yet) has been in a live tv musical twice (though they could) I also thought of Audra McDonald but same problem she already did Sound of Music (if she did do it I can see her as the witch or Cinderella's mother)",2016-08-21T06:24:47.000Z,0

Columbia Pictures and Jim Henson productions have already cast actors to be in the early production-- Robin Williams as the Baker, Goldie Hawn as the Baker's Wife, Cher as The Witch, Danny DeVito as the Giant, Steve Martin as the Wolf and Rosanne Barr as Jack's mother. In 1997, Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan and Susan Sarandon were in the talks to be in the film. But everything have fell apart and be held for the film to be made for a long time.

First, let me address fans of the Musical ""Into the Woods.""  I have no doubt that the musical itself is very enjoyable.  The dark themes and existential question it confronts are great and things I typically relish.  The common retort, I hear, is, ""what did you expect?...it's a 'dark' musical ""not meant for kids!""  

Agreed!  But mind you, not everybody has had the cultural privileges of being acquainted with every musical, and this is no small group.  To this majority demographic, one must rely on the traditional avenues for judgement on the content of a film: 1) Trailer  2) Rating 3) The studio making the film.

In this case, we have a trailer that does not expose the adult nature of the film; we have rating of PG, and under the banner of Disney.  Furthermore, every preview of the film was targeted at children.

*spoiler alert*

So what about the film was so egregious in its inappropriateness to children?  How about the themes of sexual lust?  (Prince Charming seduces one of the main protagonists' wife, and she willingly obliged) Pedophilia?  (Johnny Depps 'Fox' character has ""White Van no windows"" undertones) Meaningless death? (many are killed for no apparent reason other than to say the world is cruel.)  Mind you, I am no prude, I can critically sit through  Gaspar Noé Irreversible and not even flinch.  But I would like to keep my children's innocence for at least some of their childhood, thank you very much, Disney.",2015-01-20T19:26:21.000Z,0

Being of Indian heritage, I was forced to watch the stupidest, over-dramatic musical movies and it just angers me to see a brilliant scene ruined by a song. However, the fact that it was slightly darker and had a brilliant ensemble cast made up for it. Also I agree that there should be more diversity in the cast, just because they were written for white people, doesn't mean they all have to be white. People don't want to see the same thing over and over again. ",2015-01-11T12:58:32.000Z,0

It was good film with a great cast however I felt quite a few scenes were unnecessary. Such as the prince seducing the baker's wife, the baker's wife dying etc and after the wedding scene it felt like the film just went downhill after that and that it should have ended then. I understand it was to show a tragic ending but it just felt slightly unnecessary. Some of the scenes were not scary but not suitable for PG such as the mother cutting her daughter's feet, the birds blinding them etc. there were so many different plots that none of them were detailed. Found it enjoyable but a bit confused with all the different plots.

too much singing maybe kids like singing but not a singing person. its like singing through the whole story.
Characters, some die, or there some parts that kids shouldn't see some parts.
It mostly dark parts, but to me I don't like the story how it mix up.
if you going to watch the movie just to let you know ITS A MUSICAL SHOW. 
sucks i wish i should of know earlier.


I don't like the ending at all, the baker, Husband I wish he knew the the truth about his wife what happen between her and cinderella prince. Thats one part. and plus I dont think the baker doesnt get to still see who his sister was. I dont feel like saying the other parts but all i have to say to me rapauzel has a happy ending too me.

All of the songs did not leave me humming. I did not find any of the songs catchy or clever. The plot was horrendous. Everything about the plot was random and irrelevant. The plot was not well written. The tragic part at the end of the movie was random and irrelevant to the whole story. The movie would have been a lot better if they didn't add the tragic part (not that it would be good, just better).There was no central moral or any enlightening and special moments. The characters were bland and lacked charisma as well as uniqueness. The baker's singing skill was not up to par. [SPOILER] The death of some of the characters were irrelevant and not very well written.

Into the Woods, is supposed to be done over-the-top, like a cartoon. What makes the story funny is how stupid and overdramatic its characters are (Chris Pine did a fabulous job with this), and when you make something like this serious, it makes the story, overall, drag, when it's supposed to fly by, due to the comedic timing and ""fake"" acting. Meryl Streep and Chris Pine deserve some type of recognition for their acting. They were the best part of the film. Though it's message, in the grand scheme of things, was to be careful what you wish for, I felt like that message was being repeatedly slapped in my face, not gracefully sewn into my heart, like it should be. Sad to see this movie flop. I had high hopes. ",2015-01-01T09:45:39.000Z,0

2014-11-06T08:01:04.000Z,2Byk9Is3TjY,Into The Woods Trailer - Now Playing In Theaters!,"my exp. with musicals is the Peter Pan one starring Mary Martin (which i watched obsessively on VHS as a kid) & the Psych musical episode (which i liked). so while i don't consider myself a musical fan, i guess it's no surprise i enjoyed this one. beware, people who tune out music after a while. ITW requires close listening, for the songs/lyrics make up the dialogue and are interconnected.

i was surprised by how funny it is. laughed out loud a lot; sometimes i was the only one. there was constant laughing near my area, where most of the adults sat (range of 20s to middle age), and silence in front—kid zone—for those same scenes. that should give an idea of how one's understanding plays a part in enjoying ITW.

the plot ties together Jack and the Beanstalk, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, and Rapunzel in an interesting way. while those are well-known as fairy tales, i like how ITW presents them in the form of a fable. tip: searching for/questioning that lesson while watching might hold your attention in the movie more.

for a character not emphasized early on, the Baker became my favorite. by the end he's the binding force in the other characters' lives, in an ironic Happily Ever After. i'd have liked his connection to Rapunzel, which viewers learn early on, revealed. in fact, Rapunzel basically disappears near the end so her storyline isn't concluded at all. minor gripes though.",2014-12-31T06:56:21.000Z,0

(SPOILER well... a little) These characters goes into the woods to perform tasks to fulfill their wishes (via magic). Once completed, they soon found out that their wishes had consequences and didn't really bring true happiness. They learned the only way true happiness can be found is by hard work. The film Pinocchio says  ""go ahead wish upon a star"", Into the Woods in completely opposite saying ""be careful what you wish for"".

There were lots of characters to develop so the film may seem long, but it was portrayed pretty well. (There were a few parts that could be improved imo). It was advertised to be a musical too so I don't see why ya'll upset.",2014-12-28T21:54:47.000Z,27

2014-11-06T08:01:04.000Z,2Byk9Is3TjY,Into The Woods Trailer - Now Playing In Theaters!,"Just saw this movie a couple hours ago. Here is my opinion: Everyone in this movie should win Oscars for singing and acting and all in all making this film one of the only good musical-movies, especially Meryl Streep. This is one of her greatest achievements, singing and acting-wise. And Emily Blunt too. Overall, the message of this movie is clear and true: Be careful what you wish for, because sometimes if you want something bad enough, you will do anything to get it, telling yourself that the end justifies the means, without giving one thought to the repercussions. Lilla Crawford was her usual sterling self, just as mind-blowing as she was in Annie, maybe even more.James Corden was pretty good. I LOVED the scene where Chris Pine and Billy Magnussen performed ""Agony"", where, instead of making it sad and depressing, they made it overly dramatic hilariously. Chris has got an impressive set of pipes. Anna Kendrick was VERY good at singing Cinderella, but she didn't really play the part of the damsel in distress. Nothing wrong with that, though. Johnny Depp was awesome. MacKenzie Mauzy was okay. She didn't act and/or sing that well, but maybe that's just because she was surrounded by people who were AMAZING. Daniel Huttlestone was good. Sang quite well, and not bad at acting. So all in all, I'd give this movie a 5 out of 5.",2017-03-17T02:45:49.000Z,402

One of the problems this movie has is that while some parts were done as a movie adaptation should be done, the rest are like watching a stage theater. The stage version of Into the Woods had like one background design because I guess the budget wasn't big enough to make more than one so the characters would have to sing about what they've gone through. Some parts of the movie do that except it doesn't show how it happened while they were singing. Thats why its called a movie where you show more than you tell. But overall, this movie ain't bad.

I won't spoil anything, but the movie bogged down and a lot of the scenes that brought the four main leads together felt forced. The characters swing moods to quickly and things happen abruptly.

It would have made this movie even better and more inviting because it adds familiarity to different audiences.  This now looks like a fantasy movie made back in the days where the cast were British of American accented white people.  Don't get me wrong the movie looks great,  but tell me how a black witch,  or a charming Asian prince of just random coloured people wouldn't make it just that much better,  involving the whole world into this fantasy picture rather than just pleasing the imagination of the Western white world?  One of the greatest things of Harry Potter was that the cast was so diverse and I as a small kid always wanted to go to Hogwarts too because hey,  I saw every possible race in there,  it was somewhere I could have gone too. Even though the protagonists where white that doesn't matter because it's how Rowling invisioned it, we're not claiming to always put in random coloured people in major roles for racial diversity but why leave them out if there are indeed roles they could have portrayed.  Plus it would offer more roles for coloured actors to pursue because it's still an issue that coloured actors have a way harder time of being casted into various roles.. They're mostly being casted for stereotypes ",2014-12-17T10:22:32.000Z,0

I have never seen a white person in The Lion King on Broadway, but no one calls racism on that. This is strictly based on talent and a little publicity.

Also some of my fav songs haven't made the cut like the reprise of agony and I know Disney will dull down some of the humour cause it's a kids film which is sad cause my fav characters were the princes cause they were so funny yet in the film they seem more serious.

These fairytails' heritages stem from countries with a mostly white population. Why? Because it's accurate. So why are dragons and magic in the movie? Because it is accurate to the story. A lot would say that it is racist to take a beloved story focused mainly on black people and cast white people to portray them. Vice versa? Totally fine. Double standard, much? What I'm trying to get at as that we should be more concerned with the core plot of the movie, not the skin color of the people portraying them. I would understand the moaning and groaning if this film outright made someone who was clearly another ethnicity than Caucasian white, but that isn't the case. Just enjoy the movie or don't see it at all. All this bitching isn't necessary, you guys. ",2014-12-07T02:06:21.000Z,0

They do this by getting popular actors to draw crowds no matter the race. It just happens that popular media today happens to be white people. Don't act like if you were in their shoes you wouldn't pick the actors that would provide the biggest return on investment.  Also as one of the comments said, hiring diversity for the sake of diversity is a form or racism. Its like TV Ads that have one white, black, indian and asian child. You'd think that those ads are trying too hard and comes off as a bit racist at the same time. In making a movie, diversity shouldn't be the goal, it should be to have the best people capable for the job. There no reason to have some type of affirmative action in the entertainment industry. Lastly, unless you have a listing of every person who auditioned for every single role you cannot say that these individuals weren't the best choice and that people of other races were completely ignored.",2014-12-01T03:14:35.000Z,0

There are also the people who cry and bitch when movies change things (as in the race of a character). I mean, all of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales are set in Germany, which consisted of mainly white people. I understand if it's a random movie that has only white characters, but the origins of these fairy tales make it necessary to have a white cast.
People who demand a diverse cast mess up things too. An example would be the upcoming Fantastic Four movie. The origins of the Fantastic Four are an all white cast. So, what do we do? We make the Human Torch black! But wait a minute... the Human Torch and Invisible Woman are siblings. ""Oh no problem. It's possible. He could be adopted.""

In the show they say, ""Wishes may bring problems such that you regret them. Better that though than to never get them"". The point of the play is while wishes can be short sighted and cause pain (I won't say how, but there are many instances of this in the show) you still need to have that belief in hope. That even when things go badly you still ned to wish. This show just means so much to me, and that message has been so influential in my life it makes me sad to think that this is what people are going to think of into the woods as. ",2014-11-20T00:47:14.000Z,1

1. Stephen Sondheim returns as the music director and composer.
2. James Lapine revisited the musical's book and wrote the screenplay. 
3. Disney-produced. 
4. Rob Marshall-directed (director of Oscar winning Chicago) 
5. Chris Pine plays the prince. 
6. Meryl Streep plays the witch.
7. Literally everyone performing can actually sing.

I hadn't realized that this was going to be a Disney film, and although I am one of the biggest Disney fans you'll ever meet, I'm worried that, because it's Disney, (and PG,) it won't include the darker themes and humor. I imagine that they would have to alter the storylines and cut out quite a bit in order for it to be given a PG rating. I'm hoping for the best here, and it's great that kids are being introduced to it, but that will likely result in a watered-down, kid-friendly version.",2014-11-15T14:27:19.000Z,0

Then search for Into The Woods and show only albums, then look for the movie soundtrack Into The Woods (around 50 tracks) and click in one of the songs (you'll get a snippet of 45 seconds more or less for each song). I highly recommend you to click in Stay With Me and Last Midnight. Those people who thought or still think that Meryl Streep does not have the voice to pull those songs off, well you were so wrong and you'll be blown away.

The biggest complaint that gets levelled at him these days is him always acting behind 2 feet of make-up and ludicrous costumes, so he clearly has absolutely no problem covering up, in fact he prefers it. And Disney did not change the costume so we could see Depp's face as they wouldn't of had him so covered up as Tonto last year, or Alice in Wonderland or in ANY of the Pirates films. Disney is the biggest studio on the planet, it does not need Depp or any other actor to draw money, it does it on its own name alone and anything else is just a bonus. Wait and see the film, then give your opinions on Johnny Depp. You can criticise the costume, but you cant criticise Depp when you know full well he has no problem hiding his face and when you haven't even seen his performance.  ",2014-11-07T13:16:15.000Z,0

There must be. Meryl Steep sound pretty good. I do hear some dialogue thats not in the original show, thats concerning.
