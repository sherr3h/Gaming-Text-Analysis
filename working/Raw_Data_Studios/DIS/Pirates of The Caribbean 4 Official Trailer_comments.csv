Mainly because it wasn't what I was expecting. When I think of POTC I think of them sailing on the sea on a cloudless day and here was a movie with almost no ocean in it at all. But looking back it was still a fun adventure movie. It is not necessarily worse than the others as it is just different - and that threw me off at first but I am now use to it so I like it.,2015-07-27T16:08:53.000Z,58

I absolutely hated the 2nd movie because they made jack sparrow look like a wimpy pirate. In the 1st movie they showed Jack as an idiot, but towards the end you realise he's an absolute genius, and always being one step ahead of everybody. But in the second film whenever Captain Jack Sparrow was on camera he was always running away from something or just screaming. But for the rest of the sequels, it showed why Captain Jack Sparrow truly is the best pirate.",2013-04-23T03:43:12.000Z,0

Amazing plot, great characters, memorable scenes, and an amazing soundtrack to top it off.

I love Johnny Depp, but Captain Jack didn't make me laugh as much as he used to. New characters like the priest were much more interesting because they're, well, new. And we don't know much about them, so we actually get excited about seeing more of their character revealed in the movie. 
As for the lack of Orlando Bloom, it wasn't his character that we missed, if you get what I'm saying. ;p ",2011-05-23T01:27:49.000Z,0

Blackbeard was interesting. He wasn't as creepy/evil as Davy Jones, but he had an interesting character and personality.
Though I couldn't help but notice that to combat the lack of Orlando Bloom they had to add a hot clergyman, a cute cabin boy/deckhand, and an army of Spaniards. Hehe.",2011-05-21T03:45:57.000Z,0

Spent 12 hours making a ""Homage Remix Vid"" and am going to write a review
so I'd BETTER go! XD Hope you have fun viewing.=)

What's important to remember is the storyline is based off of the adventures of Black Beard.
This series will likely go on and on so as long as people are willing to view it on the big screen
instead of reading about it in the books! ^_^ 

Can be much more fun that's for sure! =D

If you do not want to see it then do not go and view it. 
Thus far, I have enjoyed every pirates of the Caribbean and gone to the theatre
to see the films and will say that it is not wise to compare anything before it is experienced.

I am looking forward to this film and think that 7,000 viewers [as f this writing] agree!

Captain Jack Sparrow is indeed a very likeable character and the actor who brings out the spirit of the character is indeed very great and doing so. However... the story is what matters most--which is the collective body of characters and experiences which are shaped from what is presented.

With or without the component of any good story -- a story would suffer.

It is as if the french revolutionaries had named their country ""The Republic of Europe"", and since then, germans, english and spanish couldn't say that they were ""europeans"", because the french said that they are the only europeans. Sadly, the usurpation of the name is done. Thanks to God, in spanish ""americano"" still means ""from the american continent"" (v/s ""estadounidense"")",2011-05-14T17:08:55.000Z,0

2010-12-13T16:33:42.000Z,t5AqJww06bw,Pirates of The Caribbean 4 Official Trailer,"considering all the movies revolve around Jack Sparrow...it makes perfect sense that she would NOT be in it..based on the end of the third why would she fallow this story...perhaps when they make the 5th one they'll tie up all loose ends, but as goes its about Jack ..not her
oh and just and FYI ...she is one of my favorite actresses, so this is not a a bias opinion, its an honest one.....

That is all
