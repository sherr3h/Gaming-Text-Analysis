With what happened in The Last Jedi I was somewhat skeptical but I ended up satisfied and even rewatched Solo.. Lando‚Äôs costuming is sweet! I‚Äôd say one unfortunate thing was the timing because it was marketed and advertised during Avengers: Infinity War so not a lot of people may have seen the ADs etc..

After seeing it on Netflix, I greatly enjoyed the movie and I would have enjoyed it more on the big screen. I see that I can not trust film critic anymore, because I see that they are either more political, or they did not get enough money to speak good about this film. They need to learn to not to destroy things, and people careers, because they just don't remember to how to have fun and tell the truth about a movie that has real entertainment value for everyone and their fans.

2018-04-09T00:45:48.000Z,jPEYpryMp2s,Solo: A Star Wars Story Official Trailer,Pretty decent little Star Wars adventure. Not quite as epic as some of the other canon films but it has its charm. The first act was not great but it picks up and gets better as it progresses. The editing/story feels a little too fast paced at times and it would've been cool to see more depth built into some of the characters but I enjoyed it overall (especially after the trainwreck of The Last Jedi). I'd actually like to see how some of the surviving antagonists figure back into future stories.,2018-11-15T05:10:21.000Z,0

They have forgotten the best of stories play upon the hopes, dreams, struggles of real life issues as so many of the ancient fairy tales have done. Instead they are enamored with CG, the money guaranteed by the profitable story-line, and the flash of action over the premise of all movies & fairy tales, the story-telling.This movie was predictable and almost boring.",2018-10-28T02:41:06.000Z,0

Didn't even bother looking at this movie in the cinemas and it seemed to carry this reputation that everyone was hating on it. I think most people were also a little disappointed with ep. 8 and decided not to watch this movie because it was being released so soon after it. Hence why people are saying it bombed in the box office (I don't know if it actually did). But to me, this film felt more like the older films with it's cheesy moments (without trying too hard, somewhere I think ep8 went wrong) and overall interesting story and memorable scenes. I don't understand how some people disliked this movie. It was pleasantly surprising. Maybe it was cause I went in with low expectations but I still think it was great either way.",2018-09-24T13:53:08.000Z,1

I do remember being uninterested with the slow plot, glancing at my phone for the time over and over again, and feeling like I watched a Rebels episode that should have been only an hour, not two. Yes, the main actors/actresses were superb and one scene was visually stunning, but as a stand-alone Star Wars movie, I was almost as disappointed as most of us were with episode 8. Blame that on Rogue One I suppose. I will always have a special place in my heart for Star Wars but this new generation of films is only 1-for-4 so far. Agree? Disagree?",2018-09-10T05:53:41.000Z,1

I actually didnt mind the movie, sure it had its flaws,quirks, and it was not that complex. But i did like the overall feel of the movie from the new falcon, to the backstory, the mountain, to the mine. I also think it has potential for a series, the people who watched will know. So in conclusion it is not the best Star Wars movie but i would at least recommend for someone to watch it so they can make their own opinion and tell disney what did wrong and they can get better.

2018-04-09T00:45:48.000Z,jPEYpryMp2s,Solo: A Star Wars Story Official Trailer,"What we've learned is to NOT listen to critics, and listen to the voice of the true fans....SOLO WAS AWESOME!!!! Everyone go see it in the theaters now while you can because it is the best Star Wars since Empire, or at least since Disney took over (and also Rogue One which was a very cool movie...but this one actually felt like a Star Wars and not as dark as Rogue One).

I actually heard one critic say that Last Jedi was the best Star Wars since Empire, and that's just insane to me. We all know that the first two were just a reboot of the originals for modern times. How critics won't admit that is beyond me.  They are hyping up the sequels for some reason, which helps them gross more, and bashing the spin-offs.  As for the Force Awakens and Last Jedi, they were directed, casted and filmed flawlessly, but the plot took no chances and it was just the same ol story. Did anyone even stop to ask how all a sudden the Empire is back untouched and fully restored after they were completely defeated at the end of the original saga (Return of the Jedi)?

Solo was refreshing for several reasons. First off, the story line takes the risk and doesn't just mimic the original plots. It's refreshing, creative and goes off in it's own direction. The casting was spot on for every role. Hans was perfect, Lando was awesome, and all the others as well...great on-screen chemistry. The visuals and directing were all fantastic as is no surprise for Disney and Ron Howard.  So far in my opinion, the only real successful Star Wars since Disney were Rogue One and Solo because it feels like we're watching something new and not just a modern version of the originals. Go Solo! Can't wait for the next!!",2018-06-28T20:55:48.000Z,3

When did they start to make trailers that said NOTHING about the movie that they are promoting? I ask because that trailer¬† (along with every other one I've seen in the last twenty years) tells you nothing about the movie's plot.¬† It tells you nothing about the movie's conflicts, tells you nothing about the movie's hero's. It's just a mis-mash of¬†images that again, tells you nothing.¬† Back in the day (long ago before the force was invented) movie trailers use to tell you what the movie is about, used to tell you the villain's and how they want to rule the world and that the hero was the only one to stop him/her. Today's trailers do nothing to entice you to walk into the theater.¬† How can you get excited when you know nothing of what the movie is about???¬† Am I that old to where I ""expect"" the trailer to inform me of what's going to happen in the movie?",2018-06-14T12:45:27.000Z,0

I first saw the originals when I was six, then prequels, and have seen the last four Star Wars in theaters.  Let me just say that I thought that The Last Jedi was an amazing film on a lot of levels.  And for all of the fanboys that can't handle the fact that some people love different content, welcome to reality.  The Last Jedi went very different than a lot of people including Mark Hamill expected.  That's life.  Unexpected things happened and that's what made The Last Jedi so real.  In regards to Solo, all you whiners out there who boycotted it for the stupidest reasons ever, you just missed out on the best 2 hours and 15 minutes of your lives.  Thanks for perhaps ruining what could have been one of the greatest trilogies Star Wars could have gotten.  Solo was a masterpiece and I hope that people realize that because I need sequels!

But it's also a sequel to the Prequel Trilogy. But it's technically neither part of the Prequel Trilogy or the Original Trilogy. So in a sense, this is some sort of Mid-quel, if you will. But if you think about it, since the Original Trilogy is now sandwiched between the Prequel Trilogy and the Sequel Trilogy, then really that should be considered the ""Mid-quels"". That means The Prequel Trilogy is the prequel to the ""Mid-quel"" Trilogy. Likewise, the ""Mid-quel"" Trilogy is the sequel to the Prequel Trilogy. But now we have a problem. If the Original Trilogy is the ""Mid-quel"" Trilogy, then The Star Wars Story Saga cannot be the ""Mid-quel"" Trilogy anymore. So if the Star Wars Story Saga is not a ""Mid-quel"" Saga, but it is still a sequel to the Prequel Trilogy, then in my crazy Trilogy fantasizing, they must be something in between.

Now that Last Jedi has come to pass and the Skywalker era is over, instead of fighting over what happened and how it happened we should instead look forward and really think about what do we want from this franchise. Do we want it to die? live another day? what do we want exactly. I seems that Disney has no idea about what fans want and they just create the stories they want the way they want them with political messages and all of that,  instead of listening to the fans.

One thing i didn't like it is 3D in IMAX!  Yes, background was annoying, was blurred. U gonna say, yeah cause its 3D, well if u look it with ur own eyes into first plan object is sharp and background is blurred than if u look at the background ur first plan will get blurred.. Obvious.. But during the movie u can't do that. So if u want to look away of talking face at the first plan, u would not get sharp image like in real life. That 3D tech force U to focus on the object they want it. U realize that if u change face position a little bit, u get sharper image which is not so obvious from the start. Ufff, but movie is worth to watch for sure. Not so sweet like super hero movies what is great.",2018-06-03T19:11:37.000Z,1

One thing I always loved about Star Wars was, it always had this adventure, fun, cool, feel to it, while also being serious. And now I just feel like this is the opposite. The movie trailer in my opinion seems like it's presenting a movie trying to be serious, with bits of humor. Just don't think that's enough for me to see it in theaters.

You can clearly see they lied about the Alden casting. He was lobbied by Spielberg to Kathleen so the Lord and Miller were forced to cast him. 

Todays producers act like gods who can also direct, write and do anything they want without any freedom for directors and writers.

Director of Empire, Irvin Kershner, like the fired directors also tried to put the producer in his place (Lucas) and he succeded 'cause at the end of the day Lucas actually respected Kershner and the contract.
Kennedy doesn't respect anyone with his own personality and opinion.
Abrams, Johnson and Kasdan are ""the yes mam"" puppies who will do anything she says  ^^

2018-04-09T00:45:48.000Z,jPEYpryMp2s,Solo: A Star Wars Story Official Trailer,"Well, from what I've seen, I already have a bad feeling about this.

First of all, I didn't really feel any sense of excitement or hype for the film through the trailers. Even Last Jedi, which everyone hated, did better with its trailers.

Second of all, I know I might be nitpicking, but I don't like the style of the title shown here. Seriously, it's like, large, chunky, spinning letters. It looks more kiddish than even the logo of Star Wars's kid-focused show, Star Wars Rebels. Even from the title, I'm worried about the style and mood they're going for.

Lastly, reviews have already come in, with scores placing in the low 70-60s. That's basically a C-F tier. So, yeah.

I'm only going to see it to (hopefully) gain a little bit more lore on the Pre-Battle of Yavin era, because, well, I'm kind of a Star Wars geek. Other than that, I don't expect to enjoy it.",2018-05-24T16:03:04.000Z,0

2018-04-09T00:45:48.000Z,jPEYpryMp2s,Solo: A Star Wars Story Official Trailer,"Carrie, Mark and Harrison didn't have much experience before episode IV and look how that turned out. Alden is good actor, but not for this part. Only reason he got it is because Spielberg lobbied him and then Kathleen forced the original directors to cast him. 
You can teel how Lord and Miller were forced to lie to look like they were one to chose Alden and when they got fed up of Kathleen trying to do their job they just quit.
This is problem in many of the mainstream movies today --- producers are acting like directors or they just hire uncreative puppies like Johnson and Abrams who will do everything they say.
Reason why the Empire Strikes Back is the best Star Wars movie is because Kershner made it it's own movie.

The movies are never going to be the same as they were before, but that does not mean that the new ones can't offer us a new take on Star Wars and exciting stories that get your blood pumping. The fantastic thing about Star Wars is that the universe is so expansive that nearly anything is possible, and that means that there are nearly limitless stories to tell. Am I blind to the flaws in the newer movies? No, I am not. I just choose to focus on the positives instead of heading into a movie saying ""This movie is going to be garbage"" and ""boycott this movie"".

Kathleen Kennedy, makes the big decisions in all of these star wars movies. She mishandled Solo, by choosing the Ehrenreich to play Solo, only because Stephen Spielberg recommended him. She took his recommendation, and the original directors (Lord and Miller), are quoted as saying Kathleen didn't consider any of the thousands of other auditions. She also fired Lord and Miller because of creative differences, and this is one of several times she's done this.

They forgot the old races of universe and replace them with some new whatever this is. The feel of SW is simply not there. They forgot planets like Falucia with strange enviroments and replace it in all movies with Earth like planets where siply nothing looks like SW. I don't know, it's just strange and it is really very vissible how Disney want their money back and milk SW to the bone while the fame still lasts. And this is the main problem I think why all new SW movies are simply very cheap on strory and you watch 2 hours long nothing with loads of effect but empty inside.

They traded one kind of diversity for a another - diverse humans (mandalorians?) and no diversity of aliens. Heck the ONLY alien main character here is Chewie - but he is carried on from the main star wars plot. I'm seeing that the overall trend is more human characters (especially main characters) and aliens getting sidlined.

Also, the agenda that they are pushing in the franchise has a lot of flaws in the overall franchise  itself, There is no denying that the catastrophe that hit us last December has  divided the entire fanbase, (some love it some hate it), this could hopefully be a chance to repair some of the fanbase to its former glory.",2018-04-15T06:30:19.000Z,0

Understated fun compared to The Last Jedi which, love it or hate it, made changes and had many revealations (again, love them or hate them) and was a large-scalw film.

I have  a feeling that the new star wars side stories (Rogue One, Solo, etc...) will outdo the main episodic stories.

Its just a feeling but if this movie turns out to be great then I'll be looking forward to more side stories in the future.

And before any of you attack me, I believe the Last Jedi was a bad movie simply because of its structure and uninteresting characters.

But don't get me wrong I don't hate the Last Jedi or any of the star wars movies. I just feel like that the last Jedi lacked substance and it felt like another Transformers movie directed by Michael Bay.",2018-04-10T03:29:27.000Z,0

Solo won't be the lead in his own movie and is utterly incompetent and only became the badass smuggler that we knew him as because emilia Clarke's character taught him, shell save him at least twice and probably even do the kessel run for him.
Chewbacca will not die or say or do anything of significance same goes for lando.
He and his talented actor will be nothing but an underutilized feature.
Woody harrilsons character is gonna be a 2bit traitor cliche that turns out to be the main vilian.

2018-04-09T00:45:48.000Z,jPEYpryMp2s,Solo: A Star Wars Story Official Trailer,"Disney's Star Wars ""side stories"" are better than their main films because the characters are victims of probable, well-established circumstances and within these circumstances, they struggle to get through.
Whereas the main films operate out of geocentricity‚ÄîCharacters are walking deus ex machinas without credible ingenuity or skill, of which the world and all its events revolve around. 

Overpowered ‚â† Bad Storytelling. 
Overpowered characters are completely justified if focus is first attributed to world-building and the Magic Rules that world adheres to. Once the rules are established, characters can ""rampage"" to their heart's desire just as long as they stay within the limitations of the established rules (These are some of the best stories).

Apparently my pet peeve for this movie is the unnecessary need to change the Millenium Falcon, fight the fact that the YT 1300 had a pretty stock appearance. I get their money grabbing needs to change everything else, but they literally could have left that little detail alone and ran with it. It's like every one of these new movies that have come out have dangled something from the expanded universe in our faces and then shat on it, rub out faces in it, and then told us to swallow.

When Disney first bought out Star Wars I defended them because I enjoyed what they did with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I had high hopes that they would finally get out of the Empire Era and start making movies about the Old Republic or even before. Or maybe we would finally get a movie purely from The Darkside perspective, for the forming of the Sith.

In my opinion The Last Jedi was pretty great in a lot of ways, I personally loved that it challenged expectations. So far I'm really happy with what Lucasfilm have done and are doing given the crazy pressure they must be under (mostly from so-called fans, to deliver their individual and highly specific vision of what these films and characters should be, oh and those shareholder $$$). A lot of the comments here, and the hate on display, is surprising and not at all what I'd expect from the Star Wars community of fans. It's like the haters haven't actually learned anything from watching the Lucas era films and incorporated any of that into how they conduct themselves as human beings, how sad is that!? It just comes off as puerile entitlement... What I observe when I watch behind the scenes footage (especially after watching the director and the Jedi documentary) is many talented individuals who deeply love Star Wars and are giving their all to honour Lucas' legacy, but also establish a new trajectory. Of course if you really don't enjoy these films, that's perfectly fine. But it's too easy to just sit there and be so damned negative - I assume you are here because you are a Star Wars fan - which means you're better than that. Or you're a troll, in which case - meh, move along.",2018-04-09T11:49:09.000Z,0

You can see in this ad his ‚Äúmaturing‚Äù the character. He seems young, naive almost vulnerable when he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for a shot like this for a long time‚Äù yet when you see him interacting with chewie, throwing the money in the middle etc it‚Äôs clearly further on in time and you can feel him showing more arrogance and coolness. 
If people get away from wanting to see a ‚ÄúHarrison 2.0‚Äù I think he could surprise us with his take on the character???
But biggest thing I‚Äôm taking from this is I disagree that the Lando character is set to steal the show. 
What has been, 6 movies now for chewie?? This is the first time I‚Äôve felt some depth and character from him rather than just being a prop almost. Seeing him with bit of emotion( possibly with his wife????)comedy from him individually rather than just being part of enhancing Solo‚Äôs comedy and/or emotion.

No I‚Äôm not talking about race or gender, both were fairly portrayed in the original 6. I believe that many have forgotten that star wars was so great because of its use of real props and a small party of characters we could all get behind. I feel like every character referenced in theses side movies are somehow going to make it into the 9th movie; then it will really be Marvel infinity war. Star wars shouldnt look at what other movies are doing, modern movies are supposed to take from star wars. I didnt really have an opinion about episode 7 i thought it was alright - if not a new hope remake, but then I had to digest the disgrace that was episode 8. As a relatively lazy fan of the star wars universe even I felt as though it was a grevious insult to all the fans that had grown up with star wars and had dived head first into the additional lore.( if you have yet to see episode 8 still, i implore you to stay away from it, in terms of development it was laughable and im certain you‚Äôre star wars experience will remain positive)",2018-04-09T07:06:54.000Z,0

Woah, thanks for all these comment likes! While you are here, I might as well plug my channel xD. I make educational wildlife videos which feature common backyard animals like snakes and turtles. My channel doesn't usually get many views, so I would really appreciate it if you could please check some of my videos out and let me know what you think. Thank you!

2018-04-09T00:45:48.000Z,jPEYpryMp2s,Solo: A Star Wars Story Official Trailer,"It seems tonally off in respects to the original films. Perhaps another example of a film that had too many cooks in the kitchen. Multiple directors and writers and rewrites and too much studio interference.  Of course I'm basing this off the trailers so I could be wrong. Guess we'll find out in May after Jeremy Jahns and Chris Stuckman review it..

Btw, I'm not a Star Wars fanatic, but if you're going to have a film marketed as a ""Star Wars Story"" it might be wise to do more than just fill it with familiar props and hire a director who's an old friend of the creator to replace two weaker directors. 

If they still plan on doing an Obi-Wan Kenobi stand-alone film, I really hope they don't go in this direction.. In fact, they should get the folks who wrote and directed Logan to do the Obi-Wan Kenobi stand-alone film.

IMHO

Yet The Last Jedi strayed a fair bit and this Movie strayed so much in colour timing and lighting that it could be a Tom Cruise's sci fi movie.

What did Ritchy Cunningham do fire the Lighting Director ?.
Like people said about Wonder Woman *FIX THE COLOUR TIMING*

The only advantage to it looking like this is for China to better hide that it's a Star Wars movie - by using the bland modern visual filmed in a deep dark hole style.

Also seems a bit humourless in tone too. I'm looking forward to it though as good or bad it is at least a distraction from the last one.",2018-04-09T01:27:13.000Z,0

Just forget Harrison Ford and the other movies, don't compare them, and it immediately becomes watchable.  It's not good, but I'm always happy to see a great movie in and of itself. Unfortunately Ron Howard didn't want to make this really accurate and sensible regarding acting, and the fans will be rabid about the inconsistencies, hopefully there aren't too many valid plot-associated ones like TLJ.
