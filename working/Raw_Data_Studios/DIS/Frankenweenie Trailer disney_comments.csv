I wish the dog had died in the end. It kind of defeats the whole purpose of learning to letting sparky go and appreciate the life he lived and what he left behind. Not teach kids that a simple flick of a switch will bring back someone they love.
And theres no reason to say that it would have been a sad ending even if the dog had died. The family and the kid looked peaceful knowing that their friend could stay in their hearts. The dog coming back to life spoiled the mood.",2013-10-22T15:49:59.000Z,2
