And the mock turtle dosn't even feature. And as well as this* the film dosn't have a scrap of nonsense. I love Tim Burton and this film, but wonderland dosn't feel wonderous at all.

On the other hand, as the hatter says, the movie could be much muchier. The great acting doesn't create any ties between the characters.
