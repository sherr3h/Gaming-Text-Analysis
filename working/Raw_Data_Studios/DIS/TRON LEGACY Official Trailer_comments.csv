In Tron, CLU has the classic ""dead eye"" that makes CGI characters unbelievable. An obvious example is where CLU knocks off all the items from Flynn's table, and when he looks up, both eyes are not looking in the same direction. The CGI version of a younger Flynn was a fail, they were better off looking for an actor that looked similar to Flynn at that age. Avatar pulled it off, Tron did not.",2011-04-26T01:11:54.000Z,0

Avatar wasn't the first; it just made it easier for everybody to figure that out. Just because a movie doesn't have an ""Inception"" plot or some underlying fight-club style twist doesn't mean it's a bad movie. There are so many other factors that go into critiquing a film that if your only basis for quality is the plot, it just makes you look dumb to someone who knows what they're talking about.

I share your opinion that too many people stuck to the old Tron movie and write negative reviews about the new one even if the story isnât worth than the old. The movie from 1984 is just a cult film and people reacted with different opinions when they have seen in back in the 80âs.

Disney should know better. There are some things that you do not do in sequels, things that hardcore fans will not let you get away whit.
I did like some of the CGI (not Flynn/Clue's face though).

Really liked the first movie - haven't seen this one yet. I'm hearing it's being panned by the critics - kind of like the first one - so I'll probably like this one also. ,2011-02-03T19:04:24.000Z,0

Why would they take human forms? Why is there gravity in Tron? etc. If this is a game why is there much more going on in Tron than just the two lightcycles. The Matrix made MUCH more sense but then again this is Disney and hollywood good cinema is rare. =/ My rating is - Ok.",2011-01-13T18:33:18.000Z,0

This film presents us with a one of the more unusual problems in the entire history of mankind, the problem of the universe and creation, the Creator God's responsibility to analyze all possible situations and control them, the question of the imposition of laws of the universe, creating a hologram to be such as must occur in our own universe in a manner similar but not necessarily the same, as that makes us understand the theory hologram as a programming and a God of the universe.

the reason is because if you didnt see the first one (Tron) made in 1982 Flynn created a copy of himself and called him clu and so on and told him all this stuff ect. ect. clu (flynns copy) was made to help flynn look after the world of ""Tron"" while flynn looked after his son. the reason he was animated was because in the first one where flynn copied him he was young. and his copy never grew old thats why he looks younger and animated",2011-01-01T08:06:32.000Z,0

1) He tried to eradicate imperfection. In that viewpoint he is ""evil"".
2) Programs follow C.L.U's propaganda about imperfection and see ISOs as a threat
3) Genocide
4) So it would be difficult for programs to use it and gain access to the world.
5) It is assumed he regained control of his will, since he fights C.L.U. and then regains his original 'colours' in the water.

You can sell a movie with stunning visual graphics without a good story line and still win awards (Avatar) but a truly astonishing movie, like Tron can incorporate both and back it up with a great stroy line.

More like financed it, they had little say in the production, which was all Steven Lisberger's work. He in fact co-produced Tron Legacy too...

After the original didn't become the huge hit Disney had expected they almost forgot about it, until it turned out there were tons of fans of the movie, and pretty much everybody knew that it was an important milestone in using computer graphics in movies.

If it wins for special effects it would be fair considering the original wasn't even considered for the special effects Oscar since the Academy thought using computer graphics was ""cheating"" in 1982. 7 years later it wasn't ""cheating"" any more when The Abyss won the special effects Oscar for its ""water tentacle"".",2010-12-21T19:39:36.000Z,0

an really wasn't sure what to expect when i went to see this
an at first i felt let down but as movie played on it got better an better.
if you follow the film properly then you'll find it does have a plot to it an in the end it makes perfect sense
the graphics are superb but then so is the story an the acting is fantastic too

i'm so hoping this does make money for the producers of this film as i want to be able to go back to the cinema to see another Tron movie",2010-12-21T00:03:18.000Z,0

I actually really enjoyed this in 3D (and usually, I'm not a big fan of 3D-vision). 

The only thing that bothered me was the time-dilation ratio. Milliseconds to hours? That totally breaks from the ratio in the first film, and translates to way too long a time frame in the machine, since there's no need to specify the exact ratio of our time to their time. If they do a re-edit, that's a line that should be removed from the dialog. Otherwise, it's totally cool!",2010-12-17T23:06:20.000Z,0

I played it far 2 much in college, I suspect.  ALSO, *DISCS* *OF* *TRON* was quite the rage as well, where 2 players could sit OPPOSITE each other in a fairly large booth and actually send the encoded DISCS at each other in real time...I suspect the biggest danger in LEGACY will be the *deresolution* of key computer software programs.

The movie actually has Flynn disappear in 1989, 7 years after the 1st Tron. The movie will supposedly have flashbacks to 1982 and 1989 to show how the system has eveolved in that period. Flynn drives a customized generation 2 cycle. Hope this helps. I just hope inthe flashbacks to 82' it looks exactly like the 1st Tron movie, I would geek out big time.",2010-07-23T18:33:47.000Z,0

Here is the calculation I did:

60 (minutes) * 24 (hours) = 1,440 * 365.25 (days) = 525,960 * 22 (years) = 11,571,120 (experienced days) / 365.25 = 31,680 (experienced years)",2010-03-29T22:22:54.000Z,0

Is if for the release of this movie you guys at Walt Disney bring back VMK :) (Virtual Magic Kingdom for those of you who don't know) So we can play again in a virtual world, since the Tron movies are baised on a guy who becomes lured into a virtual game:) Not sure how many miss VMK, but I know I do! :)",2010-03-09T15:33:56.000Z,0
