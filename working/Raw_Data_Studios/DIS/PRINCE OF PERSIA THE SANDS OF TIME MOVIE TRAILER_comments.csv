I'm a huge P.O.P fan so in my head I was like ""They couldn't of screwed it up as bad as the guys that made The Last Airbender"" (b.c that movie was horrible). Lets hope it gets even better if they make a second movie. If they do make one I expect Disney (or who ever decides to make it) to include the Dahaka (no matter how much it might scare the kiddies). The Dahaka is what made P.O.P: Warrior Within awesome!! And needs more blood and acrobatic moves.",2011-02-11T04:16:09.000Z,1

I think it appeals to young viewers which I am not being 41.
Some of the action was good. The scenery was good.
But I felt the storyline was weak, the dialogue cheesy.
The Princess I thought was stuck-up. I felt the Love content was tacked on.  

But clearly the movie appeals to a lot of people as you can see from the comments. So.....
For me a fantasy requires a strong foundation to make it convincing. And strong dialogue.",2010-12-28T07:27:42.000Z,0

Btw, I'd like to think there are many more who are *not only getting* the messages it has to offer. Not that you'd have to watch this movie to see that humans are selfish and greedy and that we'll all fall, if most don't change asap, ofc. Or that we're the ones who make our destiny (though, to an extent, imo... you have to be lucky, too -.- lol).

The actors did justice to the characters. Cinematography was excellent. Graphics were simply amazing. Script & humour was brilliant. Acting was awesome.

However, the only drawback was the British english. They could have done it without it to keep the Persian taste alive. 5*",2010-05-28T22:52:22.000Z,0

@ soulasassin16 how can you say they have killed it and then hope they don't mess it up. They're opposites in one sentence. 
On the bright side at least critics are saying this is meant to be the first decent game to film adaption.

Persia was very large in ancient times and covered much of the middle east all the way from Greece to India, but the people ruling the empire were largely from Iran.

It is so sad that even most Iranians don't know this. Iran has always been named Iran. It means the land of Aryans. The Indo-Aryan or Iranians that ruled Iran for 500 years (roughly from 2500-2000 BC) were from a tribe called the Pars or Fars(hence the language Farsi) and the western World which were the Greeks referred to them as The Persians. that's why in western cultures you call Iranians Persians.,2010-01-14T08:12:06.000Z,0
