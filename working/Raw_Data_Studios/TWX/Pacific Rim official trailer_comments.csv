2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I love Pacific Rim... I saw it 8 times in cinema (4 in IMAX) the summer it was released, bought a 3-D flatscreen and bluray player just to buy PR 3-D, Gipsy Danger figures and PR t-shirts, comics, making of books...just love Del Toro's love letter to the Giant Mecha & Monster genres from 60s 70s 80s Japan.

So I think with delToro still producing PR Uprising he must have been okay with how the Next Gen Jaegar's move and feel more atheletic than the Mark III & IV era Jaegars, tech advances for the new Pan Pacific Defense Corp maybe? 

I don't think the Bayformer comparisons are fair based off of a 1st trailer. Bayformer is a tone, an aesthetic of crass taste, humor and shitty designs/action lameness all around...I didn't see that in the Uprising trailer AT ALL...it seemed like the same terse heroic action/adventure about the world coming together to fight a common foe. 

So let's chill in the criticism saying PR Uprising is already shit based off of it's 1st trailer okay peeps?! I'm excited for PR2 big time, screamed out loud when the trailer was shown at my Blade Runner 2049 showing :)",2017-10-14T05:00:43.000Z,4

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Why pacific rim 1 will be better than 2 judging solely on the trailers:

-Sence of scale and weight. In 1 you can sence the weight of every punch, every move, every step. You truly feel there is a steel titan walking around carrying the best humanity can offer and it means fking business, same as a kaiju where you can feel the threat of a megamonster, thousand tons of flesh unstoppable and rampant.
Where is any of that in 2? Playdoll mechs wich seem to bemoving as fast as humans, seem smaller (probably are) and so seem the kaijus.
Any combat scenario created under these premuses does not feel like a clash between gargantuans, but more like a clash between a human and bear, with the difference human bear sword type weapons.

-The mechs themselves. In pacific rim 1 you could tell the individuality of the mechs, they had ""character"" same as their drivers, who can forget the russians? One of my two complains in PR1 was that we didnt get to see much foghting from Russian and Chinese Jaeger, but we still got something and even that little was awesome.
Do you remember any of the jaegers you saw in  PR2 trailer besides the gypsy danger evolution? I dont, while i was fighting with my eyes  in the first trailer to absorb ALL extra detail in the jaegers and kaijus, in the 2nd movie trailer i felt like i didnt care, i can see them clearly and yet the item of focus is their sword not their character.

These reasons alone are 60%-70% of the movie, there are more which i wont wet into atm.",2017-10-07T11:54:04.000Z,40

The jaegars look so anime looking and is just stupid. The new jaegars n the teaser trailer, they move so fucking fast. If you saw gypsy avenger using his or her sword and stabbing it or whatever, she ir he moves fast. Its confusing on its weight. The 2013 movie is more accurate. The robots have battle scars, and they have an accurate attack speed, considering its weight.",2017-07-21T20:45:49.000Z,0

Though sound wise I will give credit to the guy who came up with the theme tune for this movie, yeah the theme is simple but at the same time it's hard not to¬†hear it in¬†your head¬†when you see a massive jaegar slowly walking¬†through a city or through the ocean",2016-11-26T09:46:07.000Z,1

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],"When I had first seen the commercial trailers of this movie in 2013, I didn't seem interested in it, but then I started watching clips of the jaeger and kaiju fights that were uploaded on YouTube and it started to get my interest and now I love watching Pacific Rim, I just can't get enough of it. It is one of the most intense movies ever, next to Godzilla¬†(2014). Speaking of which I would like to see a crossover with Godzilla and Pacific Rim and have either the 1998 or 2014 version of Godzilla help the Jaeger Pilots fight against the kaijus. I came across fan-made art of the 1998 version of Godzilla fighting against one of the kaijus called Otachi http://pre10.deviantart.net/87ad/th/pre/i/2014/116/8/5/zilla_vs__otachi_by_thxjack-d7g12b7.jpg, http://pre14.deviantart.net/5ca9/th/pre/i/2014/116/9/5/zilla_vs__otachi_pt__2__zilla_crashes_down_by_thxjack-d7g3677.jpg.

why didnt they just send in more kaiju instead of piecemeal? 
 The self destruct nuke would have obliterated Gypsy.  The sea that came back down (a million tons?) would have done the same.
The Russians and Chinese were killed way too quickly.  It should have been more like the magnificent 7. good guy gets killed you feel something.  

that said this is my favorite hollycrap film ever.  Characters acting very good.  There are some very intelligent parts in the movie. The drift.  if you notice when the English sounding professor goes in you can see he was bullied as a kid. Not many would have got that.   The marshal tells Mako not too worry, she can catch him in the drift...

Thanks, brain! (Probably passively picked the quote up from movie's trailer on TV somewhere. But not a single scene rings a bell:/)

P.S. It seems this movie was a big hit, and I totally missed it. Don't bash me!",2015-12-21T20:35:30.000Z,1

It's not like there's much acting required. In fact I would have preferred that the character only be able to speak very little English. Firstly it reinforces her close relationship with Pentecost as the only person who can understand her. Secondly it gives the underdog duo of her and Rayleigh not only more hilarious situations but inspiring moments; imagine these two people who can't even understand each other outperforming the other teams who are related by blood. Third, I just have a thing for girls blabbering in a different language or using English like a 3 year old trying to get her point across. She will have very little lines because of her shy nature and only speak in emergency or panic. And there will be no subtitles so we are left trying to guess what she meant through her facial expressions, effectively putting ourselves in Rayleigh's shoes.

In the end Mako just turned out to be a rehash of the Hollywood heroine. She should be extremely shy to give more weight to the importance of her entering a Jaegar; talking to a boy and letting him into her thoughts should be as terrifying as facing a Kaiju.",2015-02-24T03:40:54.000Z,0

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],"*There is some references to¬†Valvrave the Liberator, where the pilots needs to use their memories as a fuel to keep the robot moving on.*

This movie has nothing to do with Evangelion, Evangelion was a psychological show, the characters, Eva, and their relations were merely psychological theories by Freud, Jung and some philosophers mindsets.

Freud applications:

Asuka/Rei/Shinji as Id/Super-Ego/Ego

Jung applications:
The Evangelions represent the unconscious, LCL represents the Libido, the soul inside EVA-01 represents part of Shinji's anima, the soul inside EVA-02 represents Asuka's anima, Rei is part of Shinji's anima, Eva-00 has no resident soul and AT Field represents barrier between consciousness and unconscious.

What it really ended up being was a really cartoonish, comic book-like film with a few minutes of CGI/explosive action, and the rest of it being storytelling (if you can call it that) with mediocre acting.

Maybe that's Guillermo del Toro's style. I dunno. But good god man, if I've ever seen a misleading trailer, it's this. This trailer made it seem like Pacific Rim was a mature themed action movie, not some Godzilla-like cartoon (with a bland plot at that).",2015-02-15T16:31:20.000Z,0

The level of detail was Impeccable. The design was ORGASMIC. Even the monsters were beautifully designed. Many of del Toro's favorite trademarks are in this movie: Japanese references, beautifully designed monsters, beautifully designed machines, rich color, fun characters, and self-sacrifice. Every frame of the movie is like a richly detailed painting. It has a simple storyline yet it works, it doesn't need more. The action and fight scenes are Fantastic because they are based on good motives and near flawless special effects. This movie by far surpasses the action and look of Transformers, has the heart of The Iron Giant, and touches upon similar themes as The Matrix (although not as deep). It's an extremely satisfying watch if you're in the mood for a sci-fi action film.",2015-02-15T04:42:04.000Z,17

Yeah ... After pacific rim 3. maybe the third will be the first prequel, Hahaha I can see that ... Pacific rim: Year Zero.
I can not wait for PR. Comics and pacific rim II. I think in the second part we will see ""Jaegers"" building towers, bridges, extracting minerals or something like that. Thanks to my ""Jaeger"" addiction, I've been thinking a lot about what will happen in the second part and I think Newton and Gotlieb will pilot the Kaiju-Jaeger, because they were linked with the brain of a kaiju and for the second part, probably already will be perfected and that would serve to enter the abyss. further that ""Del-toro"" announced the hybrid of a jaeger and kaiju, said there will be a Mexican jaeger: Matador Fury. As I thought, Matador fury probably appeared in the film along with Romeo blue, Tacit ronin and Gipsy danger, in the Bay of oblivion, after Knifehead and Gipsy danger battle. can view images of a new jaeger by a video ""Mirada"" here on youtube and if put into Google-images ""robot gigante mirada"" will be a green jaeger, with two missiles between their right hand and arm. I convinced by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrehabilitating (as they did with Gipsy) and reuse for public works, that is consistent with what has wikia on Matador fury.
And for the animated series, I think it will totally like ""Tales from year zero"" and if it really settles down between the first and second film will be something beautiful ... think about that.

-Neon Genesis Evangelion (Mako as Rei Ayanami,even her hair had purple streaks; Some Jaegers were designed after the Evas; mind sync to control the robots,etc)
-Daimos (the robots controlled by pilot's body movements)
-Ultraman (fight scenes gigantic Kaiju vs Jaegers fight shot in a city)
-Power Rangers (pilots shout their fight moves lol)

When I hear that a show or movie is about giant robots fighting giant monsters I want to see giant robots fighting giant monsters not a bunch of two dimentional characters trying to find the meaning to their boring existence through angst and drama. They make dramas for that.

Evangelion: ""I can go and fight monsters that are killing or will kill thousands, tens of thousands, or even millions of innocent people because I am the true monster and I'm too busy being angsty to save lives..."" That sum up the show?

The acting was pretty bad as well especially the asian girl who seemed like she has never acted before.¬†

As the movie was in its final 1/4th I couldn't keep my mouth closed. But it was more due to how bad the writing was especially the ending. Like most of the movie the script was bearable but as the movie progresses it gets more and terrible.¬†

This movie seems to also shout out Deep Blue Sea and Independence day.¬†

The action was so damn awesome and kept my eyes glued to my TV screen throughout most of the movie, it's plot isn't complicated or deep, it's just simple and easy to get down with, the acting was quite good, it was a freaking awesome film! A lot of directors seem to forget about the fun of making movies like these, they always seem to go for a deep message and take themselves way too seriously because of it, most of them don't really seem to have fun anymore when it comes to making movies and instead, just do something meaningful and deep, while Pacific Rim reminds us why we love movies in the first place and why we have so much fun watching them, without any deep message or serious dilemma, because it doesn't need any of that and just haves fun with itself while also remaining consistent and even touching. It's clear to me that Del Toro had fun making this movie and knew what the hell he was doing while making this, unlike that shithead, Micheal Bay. There should be more faithfully well done and awesome movies like this, just better imo. ;)",2014-06-01T02:32:30.000Z,2

I think viewers are sometimes just lazy, why can't you make up their back story? Have imagination don't just expect it all to be spoon fed...

Seriously, not everyone's the same, some like movies to have good story and decent acting, some like movies to be more focused on action and special effects.
I personally find this movie good, because it's what was intended to be: a pure action film. Yes, a plot with more twists wouldn't have been bad, but it was still OK. And about acting, the whole film is based on Giant Aliens vs Giant Robots, not Giant Aliens vs People. So yeah, good acting wasn't a must-have for this particular movie.

Super tech, but all the armor is so chaffed and damaged and its not like the run into things with the suits all the time. Isnt there some commander that comes around in a parade and looks at the state of the suits and go , 'WTF? Who is in charge of paintjobs over here?'. Anyway, if you push a story into the future, basic stuff should advance too.

The effects of the movie is really cool. The graphic colors are naturally a bit saturated, but this is aimed at action. We are entering the spot where we cannot see the difference between CG and real anymore. Scary, but exciting at the same time. Most of Gravity is pure CG.

This is a true tribute to the kaiju genre, and the first great scifi movie that I have seen come out of the big budget works in awile. There IS character development, if you look at the main dude and Mako Mori, this is about getting back on that horse, forgetting the past, and rising up above your problems, like the japanese phrase ""GANBARRE"" keep on going, without care to whatever you failed at before, rise above it. A great female character that wasn't just there to flaunt her body, and beutiful special effects. To those who say its nothing more than dumb action, thats okay for ypu to think, but dont go thinking you can just debunk all of us who Truely got Del toros vision. Thats the problem with the general public, always taking stuff for face value, i look forward to my fellow kaiju bros and sisters at the new Godzilla next year :)

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],"From a stand point of a person who has no prior knowledge of Evangelion let me throw my review. Rinko Kikuchi made me hate her character so much that through the entire movie I was hoping Robert Kazinsky would kick her in the face and break her nose. Since this is my first exposure to Rinko I would skip any movie she would make an appearance (Kristen Stewart of Japan). Charlie Hunnam is an ok actor but most of the acting he did not make any sense. Can someone please explain to me why he felt for Rinko's character because I had no sympathy for her or her younger self, all she did through entire movie was cry. Idris Elba Robert Kazinsky and Max Martini were the only ones who delivered in this movie. Graphic work was the best I have seen in a long while. Besides that, the background actors made me lough every time then made appearance; their faces resembled something between ""where the fuck am I"" and ""let me smile the most retarded smile I can master"".
P.S
I personally can care less what rotten tomatoes critics, or users rated this movie as. V for Vendetta rated very low and it was one of the best movies I have watched. Grow your own brain and have opinion of your own.",2013-11-21T06:49:34.000Z,2

Of course there are some differences between this & Evangelion, but the point is, the concept is still basically the same. Except in Evangelion, the mechas only have 1 pilot each...but have you ever heard of the 1970's anime called 'Magne Robo Gakeen'? In that anime, the mecha also has 2 pilots. 

So the concept of 'Pacific Rim' is like a conbination of Evangelion & Magne Robo Gakeen.

Actually, no wait... the Third Godzilla is like 30ish, the second died at 40, the first died at less than a year old.
On the other hand, pre-mutation Godzillasaurus (which becomes Godzilla 1) was probably around maturity, so,  25ish
So yeah, Godzilla 3 during Pacific Rim is asleep in the Antarctic, or he's seeing if humanity can finally survive a giant monster army after the massive fuck up that was 2004.",2013-10-20T01:13:23.000Z,0

Having a ride at a Universal Studios Theme park warrants that the work it references to is part of popular culture like Harry Potter and The Simpsons. No doubt that Pacific Rim is not part of the populat culture as of yet. It's more like a niche genre for mecha and kaiju fans. Far from being in pop culture.

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],Some people are quick to point that it's a rip-off of Evangelion. But who cares. The Japanese had plenty of time to make a live action film and they never did. The Japanese are the best when it comes to anime/cartoons but their live action films suck. Crappy low budget special effects. The only exception is Godzilla. I don't mind a guy in a rubber suit smashing miniature sets. But the rest of Japanese live films are terrible.

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Bad marketing almost killed this movie. The ads catered to the fan base of the genre but ignored the mainstream audience. Thanks to the international community, it's been a smash hit and has the potential to make a sequel. Yes it's light in story but it's intention is to have fun watching the movie. 

By the way, you can clearly see the fight scenes and make sense whats going on unlike any of the Transformer movies where you see close ups of moving gears and parts.

And Pacific Rim is more inspired by the rest of the Mecha subgenre, not just Evangelion. Gipsy has rocket punches, Mazinger's Breast Fire, so on and so forth. Evangelion is not the first show to use the concept of Giant Robots being made to combat Giant Monsters. It just used the premise as a vehicle for some really grim psychology.

1. Evangelion aren't robots, they are giant clone cyborgs made from the first Angel.
2. The synchro in Eva is with the robot itself while in Pacific Rim it's a synchro with the other pilot.
3. Evangelions are monsters, abominations, something inhuman and impossible to understand, something that might destroy humans if mishandled. Jaegers are just giant robots called monsters because of their size and amount of firepower. It's like calling a tank a Monster. ",2013-07-31T12:47:10.000Z,0

Transformers is just a crappy cash in of an action movie. They're not even the same action Genre. So no it's not a valid comparison.

Why not start each fight with a missile instead of monsters-mechs slap fighting? Also, the facts that Kaijus came from and fought very well in the ocean didn't ring a bell to people living along coast. They got a damn 7 years to move and build population inland and there they were in 2020, building a defense center in an overpopulated peninsula. If Kaijus are clumsier on land, why not move inland and use the coast as a battle ground instead??",2013-07-21T18:22:05.000Z,0

Let's get one thing straight. Evangelion was one of the most popular Anime's out there. You seem to not understand the meaning behind it all, you see wimpy emotionally unstable children, well they ARE 14 year olds in charge of defending the Human race. Pacific Rim is a simplified knock off for those who just like fighting robots, And they have emotionally unstable Grown ass people.",2013-07-21T08:05:53.000Z,0

Let's get one thing straight, Gayvangelion was a load of dogshit even for an anime. Nothing but a load of convoluted bullshit about living mecha's being piloted by whimpy emotionally unstable children. Pacific Rim has nothing to do with such crap and as such is a far more entertaining film. At least PR doesn't attempt to bog it's self down in some boring spiritual element.

Sure this movie  had parts based off of different mecha animes but there's a difference between real life movie stars acting and a bunch of animated characters getting voiced by actors.

No shit, robots are similar to robots, what's next Captain Obvious? Again, there are no robot on robot battles in Pacific Rim, so what's your point?
Oh please, the genre is hardly from anime. You can trace giant monsters and robots from way before. Might as well say anime was ""inspired"" by War of the Worlds. Actually, why say it at all?",2013-07-19T19:57:05.000Z,0

And honestly, I like it, if Hollywood wants to ""be inspired"" by anime, then that's great... After all, it's better than the 'Oh the series is over? Lets reboot it!"" that we had before.",2013-07-19T19:00:39.000Z,0

Just one scene with a shirtless stud!! What's even more impressive was how the main characters connected. Not necessarily through physical interaction. With the exception of the fight scene. But through their memory merge of which both shared a tragedy. This strengthened their bond even more. You couldn't pilot the damn things otherwise.

If there really were such creatures in this film that existed beyond our realm of comprehension, we have nothing that would halt their onslaught. 

Using ""conventional"" nukes, we would eventually either run out of cities to save by leveling them, or the resulting winter from so many warheads would turn the planet into a frozen irradiated wasteland.

Personally I didn't even hear about it up until a couple weeks before the release. The trailer didn't really do as good a job as it could have.

However the film introduces itself as a gritty take on a genre dominated by anime and kids TV, however half way through they begin layering in a tone reminiscent of the game Blood dragon. You see the film begins to gently mock its source material whilst also paying homage to it. Yet as an audience member you are still expected to find emotional bond to a character who so cheesy and autonomous I thought I was watching an Arny film from the 80's.",2013-07-17T20:28:38.000Z,0

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],"My two takes...

1.) The ""chain sword"" weapon was not a part of Jaeger Gipsy Danger's armament until its rebuild. Mako Miro was the engineer in charge of the rebuild and added it in between the five years since Becket was absent from being a pilot.

2.) The ""big sword"" final weapon is a familiar trope within Giant Mecha and Super Sentai genres. Since del Toro is paying homage to those genres it fits well in how it was executed IMO. Ever watch Voltron? Same thing.",2013-07-17T07:26:53.000Z,0

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Original movies with huge budgets like Pacific Rim never do very well at the box office for one huge reason:

The majority of movie-goers are stubbornly retarded who won't bother to pay tickets to see any movie unless happens to be a sequel or a reboot, or based on a book/comic.  So Hollywood has to keep doling out nothing but sequels, reboots, and book/comic-based movies.  Original IPs are usually doomed.  Hope this movie will be throwing a giant wrench into that trend.

If you are sensitive to gaping holes in plot line and continuity then don't go. If you like CGI driven special effects and shoot 'em up macho, this takes transformers and the like to a totally new level. It is fast moving and there are some fine performances and design detail but I wonder why del Toro chose this vehicle/ was chosen.",2013-07-15T20:58:59.000Z,0

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],Yep you're right. I'm from m√©xico and I had to watch the movie for first time in a small screen in english. Then I had to watch the movie in 4DX (a serious big screen) but in spanish. Just because people don't want to read subtitles. It's sad that the Movie theaters in my country ruined my experience just because my people is lazy ¬¨¬¨ they sell 500.000 tickets in spanish for every 100.000 in english that sucks.

F22 Raptors are hopelessly weak to fight a kaiju because they were only using machine guns designed to take down jets only. If they deployed A10 warthogs with 500+lb bombs and carpet bombers, they would not need to take 6 months to kill one and won't need these giant robots.

They could always drop a thermonuclear bomb or a fuel air bomb against one. Movies are downplaying the army's capabilities here.

2013-05-16T17:00:04.000Z,5guMumPFBag,Pacific Rim - Official Main Trailer [HD],I just saw this movie today and I really liked it. Definitely a unique movie. The effects are top notch and the action is incredible. The only problem is that this may have killed the chance for a live-action Big O movie because the general public will probably just see it as a rip off of Pacific Rim. Big O is one of my favorite anime and if I had the money I would fund a third season so everything could finally be explained and we can get a real ending.,2013-07-14T02:27:38.000Z,0

And that little girl was pretty good as well. But the rest was not good the two scientists were just annoying not funny at all. 

I will not mention the rest of the characters that were just not good at all. When  the film tried to be serious and human it was very boring.

When the action stopped this movie became boring and it took its self too serious at time. 

But soon as the action started it was amazing. Technically it was top notch and the 3d was good. 

It slowed down the second it concentrated on the humans. As a piece of entertainment it was good but not a great movie. 

If people liked transformers then this will be right up their street.

Ok, Evangelion pretty much applied all possible mecha tropes from all mecha shows that came before it. It either cleverly and brilliantly re-invented them or subverted them. If you go back before 1997, you might find that some very familiar concepts can be found in earlier shows from the mecha genre. EVA didn't invent the robot vs monster genre-it just put its own twist on it.

I thought the action scenes in the movie were okay, except for the ones which I had already scene in the trailers... I thought the acting wasn't the best, and some of the dialogue was really cheesy, I don't know if all Guillermo del Torro movies are like that cause I haven't seen very many, lol...

No one asks that of -ANY- non-White country.

Immigration/assimilation is FORCED upon ONLY White countries

Anti-whites call themselves ‚Äúanti-racists‚Äù but their actions lead to the elimination of only one race, the White race.

The purpose of ‚Äúanti-racism‚Äù is to genocide white children.

You seem like a confident and semi-intelligent person. You can't find ONE way to better this robot so it'd have a slightly greater advantage in battle. You'd think with the fate of the world at stake no expense would be spared.

Kind of like how this robot's head is useless because there are no eyes, ears, or brain to house. It's just extra weight and another target. I notice also the knees only bend in one direction.

The films increased the amount of screen time for the 'bots with each film, though they could have been better.",2013-07-09T21:55:05.000Z,0

1) Monsters come out of the oceans to destroy humans
2) Create giant robots to fight them

Why are you so desperate to go against the fact this is heavily inspired by Evangelion? Evangelion is MASSIVELY popular in Japan and the West right now due to the Rebuild series.

I never once said that it was a bad thing they're doing. It's going to be great (or at least I hope!). Bottom line: That's Eva 00.

It's funny, really, seeing as how just because this has giant robots it inmediately makes it an ""NGE ripoff"", when Evas are cyborgs, not whole robots, plus the origins of the monsters are leaned towards religious aspects, UNLIKE Pacific Rim.

While Eva is similar and even inspired by Ideon and Macross, in no way is it copying them. Anno had a certain vision with Eva and is constantly living up to that, just like Tomino and Kawamori did. Even if Rebuild is turning out differently than we anticipated, that's fine because I've enjoyed all the Rebuild films they've released.

It's just interesting how it resembles both kaiju and tokukatsu shows as well as Evangelion and other mecha franchises.

the Creaters were inspired to make a Story like this.
The Threat is a ""Colossal Being/Species"" that comes from
somewhere and threat's the Civilisation - like in Evangelion and
Attack on Titan/Shingeki No Kyoujin. And like in this Two Stories,
the Protectors use gigantic, humanoid Weapons to fight back.

To defend against hostile alien attack on the populace of the planet, humanity constructs giant robot soldiers to combat the threat; requisitioning the aid of certain special humans to pilot the machines.

It's the same basic concept so yes, we have seen it before EVA already did it.

The game was realeaed I think back in 1998 by Squaresoft. It was an RPG game where all of your characters piloted Gears that were linked to your character nerves and mental waves. This kind of reminds me of the game. It might be a pretty cool movie when it comes out.

1. Don't focus too much time on the human characters, we're paying to see giant robots punch giant monsters.


2. Put in some humorous moments and snarky dialogue, especially in the scenes with the humans. With a premise like this, some humor is ESSENTIAL


3. Make the giant fights clearly visible, so no shaky cam, too-quick camera cuts, or excessive darkness.


4. Keep Michael Bay and JJ Abrams away from this movie",2013-05-20T03:13:02.000Z,0

The difference between a ship and a boat is size. Generally, a boat is a smaller craft than a ship. Ship is the more broad term for any oceangoing craft. A boat is a small vehicle for traveling on water. A boat can have oars, paddles, sails, or a motor to make it move. A ship is a large boat that can travel across deep water, such as a sea or ocean. A ship is built to carry people or goods for a long distance. ",2013-05-19T11:05:39.000Z,0

Therefore any connection anyone can make to any other previous work related to that genre has some merit.

However, There Is No Ripoff Of Any Kind Going On!!! The Film Is A Freaking Homage!!!

Just enjoy the film as it is and pray to whatever deity you choose that this is just the start of a new era of Sci-Fi films where whatever you wished was a Live-Action Film gets made into one.

After the defeat of the monstrous Kaiju, humanity has begun to rebuild their society piece by piece. However, mankind would soon come face to face with another more dangerous threat when Godzilla arises from the ocean depths to wreak havoc. When the Kaiju suddenly return, it turns into an all out fight for survival. Who will remain standing?

To figure that out, you'd have to go back quite a bit farther. Personally I'd say Mobile Suit Gundam is the one of the greatest animes of all time, and most others are based off of that.

There's no WAY someone could think that is similar to Evangelion right? I think myself that this might have started as that Eva live action movie, but was changed to this over time. Shame.

Your argument is invalid. Why copy? Creativity is iteration. Create something completely original, if you even can, the audience will just walk out of the theater.

They didn't react very well to the american Zilla. I admit, this looks good, but there's Anime out there that blow this thing out of the water.

Even Real Robot stories, stories where the robots aren't just space magic machine gods.

The question you should be asking is: How much will this western take be interesting to them and how much will it be boring?

I'm saying we may have Bayformered their genre, at least in their perspective.

Jaegers are piloted by a DUO of professional adults.
