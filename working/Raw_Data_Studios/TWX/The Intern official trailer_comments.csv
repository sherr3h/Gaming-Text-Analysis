2015-05-13T23:30:05.000Z,ZU3Xban0Y6A,The Intern - Official Trailer [HD],"Nice little movie , but the same plot seen in thousands other movies . Only new subject in this movie is showing women needs to fight much more than men to run their societies the movie shows to much magical-disney blabla , but in real life it is very different . Without Robert De Niro in the movie the movie would be cheesy and be shit . Anne Hathaway is okay-ish as actress but is not "" the actress "" , and Rene Russo seems to be completely erased in this movie , first time i watched the movie i didn't recognize her . Guess Rene Russo her pride as movie star is over to me she wasn't really that great celebrity only was in Leathal Weapon 3&4 and the remake of Thomas Crown . The Intern is a good movie when it rains in the afternoons at weekend or when being sick in bed . Movie will be fast forgotten and hope they will not make sequels .",2018-03-26T02:41:30.000Z,0

Movies that are about inspiring each other, and helping you value yourself and those around you. Why does there always have to be sex? Why does the media keep force feeding homosexuality down our throats? Where have our morals gone? Where is the good now? Yea, I did bring up homosexuality, fight me if you want, but it doesn't make you greater than me. We are all allowed to have our opinions. You won't be different just cuz you wanna fight me on the internet. I loved this movie! I'm happy they chose Grouplove's song in the trailer <3",2017-04-30T23:53:35.000Z,0

I worked as an intern for the Los Angeles School district and learned absolutely nothing.  I spent all my time as a personal servant to the teachers.  If the teachers or principles actually pass on some knowledge, then there would be some consideration, but more often than not it's just a device to get free labor.

2015-05-13T23:30:05.000Z,ZU3Xban0Y6A,The Intern - Official Trailer [HD],"The Intern(2015) Movie Review :

I like these kind of movies where you can sit back and relax. I find the emotions in humans bigger and larger than the powers of superheroes. The Intern is about a young CEO Jules played by Anne Hathaway who has given her everything to set up her e-commerce business. She has taken care of it like her child and brought it to a success within a short span. Even her husband supports her along the way by dropping out from his job and looking after their daughter. However in her hectic schedule she is not be able to spend much time with her family. Even to herself. She is missing her life and her habit of taking everything on her shoulders makes her and her company miss all the schedules. This is where her newly appointed senior intern Ben, played by Robert De Niro, shows her the way to lead her life. The bond between Ben and Jules forms the crux of the story. Ben is a 70 year old widower and a very organized old school person who has worked for 40 years in a phonebook printing office. This movie shows a clear distinction between the two generations and their work culture. And surprisingly,  the old generation seemed to have managed their work pretty well. Eventually,  Jules is able to balance her life as Ben becomes her bestfriend. The movie is of today's generation and we can completely relate it to our corporate lives. The bond between Ben and Jules has been showcased very well and both the lead actors played their roles to perfection. I loved the movie. You can watch it on playstore and I am sure it makes for a nice Sunday morning watch.",2016-08-28T05:46:41.000Z,1

Didn't agree with De Niro getting with Russo. I thought he'd figure the woman from the beginning would be more his speed. And that fire drill scene, I thought Townsend would plot something to like steal Jules laptop or something and add another element to the film but instead it was just an excuse to get them talking about the affair..

Didn't agree with De Niro's influence would lead to the other interns to dress in suits in buy brief cases. 

Actually thought Jules would promote Ben at the end as a 2nd in command or something..

2015-05-13T23:30:05.000Z,ZU3Xban0Y6A,The Intern - Official Trailer [HD],"The question she says at the end, ""How have men gone from Jack Nicholson and Harrison Ford to -looks at dorky men-"". I find really irritating. Western women claim that they like dorky, compassionate, sensitive, some degree of metro-sexuality, humble, nerds and we're bombarded with movies in which a hero that's all that personified, somehow wins the girl. However, lots of studies suggest that women are attracted to very manly, even aggressive/strong, dominant men - it only makes sense from a evolutionary standpoint. So when someone says 'how have men gone this way', the answer is they're aspiring to be attractive to what modern women pretend they like.
 I don't know what my point was, I just feel that people seem to hate the current generation of young 20-something men, like we're constantly being told 'oh men have been such bastards for the last century', so when men evolve into these limp, dorky, sensitive guys women look at them in disgust and yearn for some manly men, who they would probably label misogynist if they thought about it for a second.

2015-05-13T23:30:05.000Z,ZU3Xban0Y6A,The Intern - Official Trailer [HD],"This would have been much better if it didn't have those horrible *neo-feminist* undertones. Nobody minds a strong female lead. It's also good to see both strong female and male leads play opposite one another with good screen chemistry. But when you get into the whole, ""He was sexist"" and ""They can't take me because I'm a strong working woman""  it just taints the whole movie with a stink that permeates social media and pop culture today. 

I'd like to make the distinction between feminism - a movement for equal rights among men and women - and neo-feminism, a plague that paints almost all men as sexist pigs and petitions for inequality among the sexes with bitterness and hate.

Otherwise, pretty good movie.",2016-02-19T04:30:21.000Z,0

Great movie with a good balance of emotional content and great timing on the comedy. Here's a copy/paste from my fb review. I would highly recommend this movie to young and ""old"" alike:)

The Intern, starring Robert Deniro. Great movie!! I highly recommend it. A light hearted comedy that was well done! Robert Deniro plays a retired CEO of a once bustling phone book company, now no longer in business due to the high tech computer era. He quickly realizes he's had enough of playing shuffle board and other retirement activities, and that he misses the challenges and the focus of the working world. So he decides to answer an add for a new upstart fashion company looking to hire senior interns to gain more ""old school"" business perspective. He soon learns that while he may be considered ""washed up"" by the much younger employees of this new company..he still has a few tricks up his well pressed sleeve and quickly garners both the admiration and respect of his younger co-workers. The owner of the company played by Ann Hathaway, however, proves to be a much larger but rewarding challenge to the retired CEO.",2015-09-25T04:34:43.000Z,0

AH HAH HAH HAH!  Hathaway is in charge of everything and she's a woman so let's show the audience how hard it is to be a woman who is in charge of everything so that we can garner everyone's sympathy but also at the same time show them that women can be successful too (it's like duh, anybody can be successful if they truly truly truly want it badly enough) because women are so stupid and weak that we need to tell them the obvious and show them that if Hathaway can do it, so can they -- and we'll roll all of these lame ideas into such a chaotic ball of mess that we'll just hide the lack of originality and innovation and storytelling by sugar coating the whole film with light-hearted comedy!  Brilliant plan guys!  We'll make millions!
