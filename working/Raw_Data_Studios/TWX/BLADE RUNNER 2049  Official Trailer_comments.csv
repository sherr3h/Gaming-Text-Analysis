It's the same plot as the first movie, more or less, with the ""twist"" that instead of hunting down rogue replicants, our Blade Runner is hunting down the child of a replicant.  The bad guy and the good guys have the same motive, so why are they fighting?  Wallace wants replicants that can procreate.  The rogue replicants want to be able to procreate.  Why are they against one another?  Wallace's replicants are supposed to be perfect now.  No running away.  No disobeying.  So why is there even an army of them ready to start YET ANOTHER rebellion.  The movie ends the same as the first one.  Rebellion of replicants about to take place.  Harrison Ford runs off with his family.  The replicant child isn't even a very viable biproduct.  She's fucking bubble girl.  She can't leave her habitat.  If that's what replicant children will turn out to be, they're 100% useless.  Ain't going to the stars with that.  It's visually stunning, but the plot holes are gigantic and the overall story is pointless.  We've seen this movie before.  This is The Force Awakens of Blade Runner movies.

I avoided seeing it in the theater -- though I wanted to -- because I wanted to see #1 first. Then when I went to borrow #1, I saw there are 4 versions! Each with a slew of passionate reviews and lots of director-production-audience baggage. I think that may have intimidated some movie goers. That said, I fucking loved both movies.

Too much explosions and fights, which didn't sit right for me.

Slow paced, yes... but never boring. And they kept the visuals true to the original, without looking outdated.
Also good performance by the actors.

At first I though it was going to be just another big budget B rated remake like the Total Recall & Judge Dredd remake but it didn't disappoint. The story & the giant blue haired Joi reminded me of Motoko Kusanagi from the ghost in the shell anime & Misato Katsuragi & the giant Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion (the end of Evangelion) https://youtu.be/mfcbhJz8YA0?t=92

It does have its moments,  I will say the cinematography/visuals were intriguing, but at the end of the day this film fails to stand on its own IMHO.  The characters were shallow, the script was disjointed, and the sound was unremarkable.

I've just tried watching it and got to the two-hour mark and had already fallen asleep three times. In fact, I had hoped to see Harrison Ford so I don't even though what he does in the film. Personally, I think it's probably one of the most boring films I've ever watched. There's hardly any action, just a hell of a lot  of talking which leaves you quite confused if you don't hang on every word. I'm not surprised it was a box office failure, it's been a sky TV failure for me and it's one film that will never be screened on my television again. Nowhere near as good as the original. Sometimes you should leave things alone and just accept that you can only make one good film, this is one of those in my opinion.",2018-07-15T13:12:04.000Z,1

A technological utopia, for a limited few,  but still, a promise.  This new film promises nothing. We have internet and we know how things are changing.

I suppose that he is meant to be an biblical allusion to pharaoh of Egypt and I suppose that Eldon Tyrell is also an biblical allusion to a king of Babylon, as Tyrell lives on top of a ziggurat, a.k.a. tower of Babylon, implying he is trying trying to match up with God.  Wallace's character model also ""challenges"" God in its own way (the story of Plagues of Egypt). And I feel that this is too much of repetition. I'd be happier if Tyrell's heir was a completly new type of character, similar to Alarich Wallenquist from Sin City; driven solely by greed. It would be a nice change and it would still adhere to neo-noir style.",2018-06-23T16:28:48.000Z,0

Consistent mindless action, attempts at humor around every corner, and one liners.

If you see the top films of 2018, Disney, Star Wars, Marvel, and Dwayne the Rock movies (Jumanji/Rampage etc.) all take the top spots, and they're all the same formula I described above.  It's sad to see a movie where actual effort went into the music, CGI, Story (catering heavily to the original fan base!) are all there, but people hate on it because it requires thought to grasp the story.  Really sad, that if this movie came out in the 80's or 90's before technology ruined everyone's attention span, it would've been appreciated by the modern day movie goer.",2018-06-05T19:23:35.000Z,3

And while Deckard (Harrison Ford) had been relegated to a secondary yet integral position, it lifted the heart watching him assist with the continuation of the overall Blade Runner story timeline. And is it me, or was Deckard tougher in his old age than back during his Blade Runner days? And while it's incredibly dated, there is a fantastic 'point-and-click' video game from the late 90's that ran parallel to Deckard's investigation. Depending upon the player's choices, and responses from NPCs throughout the game, Ray McCoy's fate was one of a possible sixteen endings. In order to avoid legal issues regarding a complicated copyright, Westwood Studios kept the familiar key locations to a minimum and introduced some background trivia of their own to the Blade Runner universe. They were also allowed to ask cast members to voice their characters from the movie. So there was some degree of connection between the movie and 'its interactive sidequal'. The 'Voight-Kamp' interrogation added some excitement to the gameplay.",2018-05-06T00:43:32.000Z,0

To revive an old film that was considered in 1982 when it came out and in later years, and has been since and still is, as a classic representing some cultural or even civilizational achievement is always a difficult task and here again, a lot of imagination and skill, if not art, has to be found and developed, though the result is slightly obscure and entangled into complicated intertwined circumstances that make facts fuzzy more than clearly explained.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"In case of BR2049 an often made complain by the audience feedback was that its story was to complex to understand (which isn¬¥t that complex and even involves a lot of hand holding and pointing fingers). This and its nearly 3 hours runtime which is also too much attention to bear for most nowadays are believed to be some of the major ""problems"" why this movie didn¬¥t do well. We saw the exact same pattern already several times. As soon a movie needs attention beyond 2 hours people minds start to melt. People also become uncomfortable, which is indeed a cinema house problem I¬¥m myself aware of. I am not super excited for going into cinema but just do it occasionally because my girl loves it. I myself love to watch movies at home and are better able to immerse there. Nowadays with streaming services progressing rapidly, perhaps the cinema exclusivity someday will become past, granting movies more freedom without being tied to a ""cinema dogma"" dictating cruical things like length. 

However it isn¬¥t the length alone why nowadays complex and intelligent movies often turn out to be dangerous projects. There are many great movie examples that weren¬¥t overly complex but still managed to overtax the crowd or not hit the current ""trend-mindset"", leading to a dimishing success. Consequence of this is that movie makers and investors may hesitate to progress and better stay true to what they are doing best for too many decades: watered down stories (deus ex machina style) that are just good enough to be carrier vehicles for their actors and their action(s) and cliche movie logic ridden black&white or good&bad characters that enable a simpler mind (if a mind is mandatory at all) to settle down and to easier sort things out. Most nowadays feel already offended when entertainment requires more brain power than barebone sustainment would. 

If you take a look at those mentioned aspects you should see the vicious circle here. Stereotypical movies for a stereotypical crowd that only is able to handle stereotypical - which isn¬¥t just true when it comes to movies. Not that it was better 30 years ago but it certainly didn¬¥t improve",2018-03-17T07:26:33.000Z,0

I have to say I‚Äôm so impressed with this film. A masterclass in filmmaking, imo. Cinematography, soundtrack and all-round great acting aside, what clinched it for me was the pacing. Every scene is so well done that it just grabs you, sucks you in and allows you the luxury of time to observe and process everything. It‚Äôs not an Oscar winning sort of movie but it‚Äôs a really special film that will become a cult classic on par with the original. 5/5",2018-02-28T18:47:58.000Z,2

2) Movement and image are different forces of nature

4) Symmetry is something that is moved through

5) A history can be supported by the parts that make up the history

6) The source of reality can feel guilty for not imitating reality

Also, there has been quite a bit' of negative press surrounding this movie, most of which I now know is unfounded.

In not so many words, I watched it and....WOW.  I loved it!  Is it as 'good' as the first? I don't think it is possible to approach the vaunted level of the original but I was definitely not disappointed.

To avoid spoilers, I won't go into details but just watch it, especially if you have seen the first movie.

Mr.Deni Villeneuve directing doing such a fantastic job he is the guy who created Sicario,Prisoner,Enemy,and arrival it makes total seance that he is Great director working today and lets talk about acting of ryan gosling this man is getting better and better at his job his work is amazing and harison ford and Robin Wright also did nice job and also Female Actress as well.The soundtrack of this move is Beautiful as hell and overall this is the best Sci-fie movie i have seen in long time.One thing that i am very impressed about that is they didn't try too hard for making this sequel i mean they didn't try to make a 7 or 8 movie franchise they just make a great Sequel of all time. 


This movie is now in my all time best movies list.",2018-01-21T11:56:05.000Z,0

It's just not organically woven into the new film and it's painfully obvious, right down to the 'imitation Vangelis' soundtrack which is so bad it should be illegal. 2049 has no depth and dimension and points to the work of a very mediocre director re-configuring and dispensing the bland expectations of a 21st century sci-fi audience who are so dumbed-down by 21st century schlock by now that they, sadly, can't tell the difference. I had to keep telling myself that the film had nothing to do with the original just to get through, but then I was left with the stark, 2-dimensionality of a truly poor work that relies on its visual effects and darkest themes to anesthetize the audience into believing they actually saw something worthwhile.",2018-01-19T06:46:05.000Z,0

To do that they would have to overcome the gravitational pull of the earth which requires a tremendous amount of energy, for example look what it takes just to get a rocket out of earths orbit it takes 7.2 million pounds of thrust to do so and these guys are floating cars around like they are feathers.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"My take on this movie and franchise.
The first movie was a great conjunction of many fortunate circumstances. Harrison Ford after Star Wars but still a SiFi movie.. great soundtrack.. and a story that was beyond reality but not absurd.
The second movie is a flop. If the movie Total Recall came to life and had sex with the movie Terminator (Salvation/Genesis-take your pick), while I-robot was watching, this would have been their love child.
Harrison Ford keeps having this whacky kids..

Still liked this though even though the music sucked compared to Vangelis' original score and the lack of dialogue didn't work this time round because the visuals sucked. Those cheap blurry backdrops didn't work. Those zoomed in shots were low budget fodder. Seems as though they had a restricted budget. But there were a couple stupid scenes, Joi spelling out the date and the memory girl actually being Deckard's daughter. Like what are the odds? Such a forced emotional ark. This film seemed unfinished on purpose like they're planning sequels. Souless like replicants, could have been amazing. Gosling was awful as usual. Seriously one of the most one dimensional actors I've ever seen.",2018-01-09T00:41:04.000Z,0

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"The story is rather weak, but overall, Blade Runner 2049 is still high art with marvelous production design and more than a few 
emotionally touching scenes included as well.

The first Blade Runner had the same problems (except it didn't have the emotional scenes).
The threadbare story was drowned under the weight of the impressive visuals, and didn't really have an impact at all.

The difference between the original and the sequel is that technology has progressed a lot since 1982, so for modern 
audiences, the visuals are now impressive enough to make up for the lack of a compelling story.
And I'm not saying the original looks bad by today's standards (far from it), but even as I watched it for the first time back in
1985, although I was impressed, it wasn't enough to make me fall in love with the film. It needed something more.

Well, something more is what Blade Runner 2049 offers. It's just a shame that the story still doesn't match the visual
beauty. If it did, we'd be talking about arguably one of the greatest films ever made, instead of ""merely"" one of the best
sequels of all time. And as it is, I'd actually prefer to watch the film without any of the dialogue.
Just music and some of the sound effects would be more than enough to just sit back, chill, and breathe in the atmosphere.

10/10 for production design.
9/10 for acting.
8/10 for music and sound effects.
6/10 for story.

Overall, a strong 8/10 for the whole thing. Which is MUCH better than the original gets from me.",2018-01-02T07:49:52.000Z,0

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"So I saw this movie. I freely admit to being an uber fan of the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù, so much so I become physically ill when I learned of a sequel. Blade Runner, the original, is the greatest movie ever made IMHO. So naturally, I was very very displeased when I saw that Hollywood was going to cash in off the greatness of the original.

This movie, however, stands on its own and Gosling did impress. The underlying story was sublime. Not as profound or well told as the original. But good.

Pros:
Gosling impressed
The underlying story was worthy
Harrison Ford made it happen
Anna de Armas... wow... her character was beautiful in every sense
Absolutely stunningly beautiful movie to behold. Cinematography was breathtaking 

The Bad...
Niander Wallace (Jared Leto) absolutely absurd. Mumbled platitudes,  androids get cut up and shot - presumably fir dramatic effect. An entirely pointless character 
Luv - although not quite as absurd, a confused and over-wrought bad-guy drama that did not come together 

Look, the original was an organic masterpiece. No fake drama or unnecessary platitudes. It was humanity in its very essence. Nothing can compare.

With that in mind, the movie by modern standards is very good. It simply must have the gratuitous nonsensical fight scenes that one must expect from todays action movies, but other that that. 4/5",2018-01-01T07:39:45.000Z,2

This is a film that's made with intelligence and for intellectual filmgoers, not the mainstream. The producers were expecting a higher gross profit, as it was distributed by Warner Bros. This may have not been a letdown if _Blade Runner_ is becoming a franchise, but we'll see. The only issue with that is releasing a sequel to a cult classic to a mainstream audience. Now, there are definitely going to be mixed responses. This film is not for everyone, but that doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be a blockbuster to be successful. What matters is that decades from now, people won't be dissecting big buck, repetitive sequels like _Jurassic World_ and _Star Wars VII._ They'll be studying, sharing, and honoring films like _mother!_ and _Blade Runner 2049._",2019-10-03T00:33:51.000Z,61

Would have preferred grittier atmospheres rather than everything being so cleansed and arty, often for the sake of it. Soundtrack not as good as original. Story was really good, emotive with some nice plot twists, love how it all tied in with original. Not as good as 1982 film, but considering 99% of sequels are shit, has to be one of the best ever made.

I will probably see it again this weekend.  For Philip K. Dick fans, this movie  continues with the themes from his novel, ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"", probably more so than the original ""Bladerunner"".  I loved it, it was very moving and thought provoking.  I was thrilled that it was much more than just a mindless display of special effects.  The effects were great but not overdone  and everything in this world seems real.  I know it was a long movie but I loved it so much I would have been ok if it were even longer.

His journey was a touching recognition of the possibilities that exist, even within his replicant mind, of living an authentic human life ... he was as crucial a participant as Dekard in this film though his memories were contrived, perhaps like Dekard's, if you believe Rick was also a replicant as Ridley Scott has stated. K (Joe) was a far less vindictive,  more self contained,  gentler version of Rutger Hauer's replicant, capable of compassion yet steadfast in his loyalty to perform as required despite his inferior status.  The splendid soundtrack adds to the viewers cerebral expansion in delving into the depth of such subject matter with grains of urgency, vitality, hope and a burning warmth one might find at a Rave.

I didn't even care when Joe's Hologram Girl dies. The purpose of Blade Runner is to have piety for the Skins. And to hope that Rachael and Deckard   would live and love and find peace.

One of the worst big budgets I've ever seen. Yes, the great R. Deakins is one of the best photographers, and great to see Ford, but you'll drown in swilly dialogue w/ a miscast Leto, douchy CG.  Even Gosling's apt. in ""Drive"" was more 'Blade Runnery' than this Ikea meets RoboSears.  Robin Wright's office looked like a Pizza Hut bathroom in Vegas.

Actions started with Harrison Ford appearance in an hour or so. I watched the audience, people literally went to sleep. there were not much of CGI effects, not much actions. Producers were just stretching out movie time on moving camera around actors. There were some thoughts about some kind of revolution at the end of movie, but guy who suppose to lead it died at the end of movie. All in all, the movie was a jello. I liked Harrison Ford action, but it did not make a movie.
Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford did better 35 years ago.

It is the best there is, even better than the likes of Prisoners or Chinatown.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"I watched this a couple of weeks back with my dad - I was the only teenage girl in the cinema hall hahah. It is obvious that the sequel is directed toward men (there is a lot of objectifying of women) - and you can also see that they made a huge effort to make this movie work. First of all, the visuals and the atmosphere are amazing, and grab your attention at once. It's like a modernised, more dramatic and sexier version of the original Blade Runner. The acting, the filming techniques and the way the story is built up - brilliant.

However, I found a couple of scenes - like the romantic ones - a little longer and more accentuated than necessary, though the girl Joi might be in the film to make the audience wonder, what really is the difference between real and fake? Are humans really more genuine than replicants? I think the theme was well chosen, and I appreciate that those who shaped this movie really put in a lot of work. For you can see that every detail was thought through.

There are small moments, details and actions that are copied from the original. Probably to make this one resemble and be connected more to the first film, but for me, it seemed rather unoriginal. I am still unsure whether I like the plotline that sets the foundation for the entire movie - I won't spoil anything, but it is sort of based on a cliche idea that ends up not having much impact on the audience (me) when finally revealed. I was disappointed with how the plot developed, and that there many (albeit little) similarities between the 1982 and 2017 films, that only gave me the impression that they were trying to recreate, or repaint, some of the iconic scenes and traits from the original one. These small semblances seemed just a little superficial and cliche. Or maybe I am being too picky. After all, people always gravitate toward romance in films.
The cinematography - or whatever you call it, visuals and effects - makes up for some of the cheesiness though. But after the first breathless impression, I was left with many questions.
I did read that they planned maybe on making another sequel, and that must be why it ended in a very open way.

Anyway, it is definitely worth watching. You forget the time as you dive deeper into the story - it is beautifully constructed, loads of details that add to the dystopian mood, and it's really intriguing and gives you pieces of information and action at regular intervals, so you never get bored. Do watch Blade Runner 2049! I don't think you'll regret it.",2017-10-28T14:00:40.000Z,1

I honestly thought before I saw it that 164 minutes was too long,but now I reckon its not long enough,the movie completely sucks you in like the industrial hoover that it is and by the time you think that it is too long,it takes you up even faster at supersonic speed by way of the quiet but deadly character K in his flying electric vehicle.It just does not let go of you,You are completely immersed and gripped by its shear power of suspense and by the deadliest and darkest of secrets.It is a1000 times darker than the original and you will love every single second of it,you will not want it to end.The soundtrack keeps you watching,keeps you awake and alert if you are tired and sweeps you away into another world.It shows the difference between what is real and what is fake,what is old and what is new.The old bladerunner model meeting the new model,but that does not mean that new is better and old is just old and useless,far from it.The old always have old tricks that the new doesn't know about,I just love the old dog who keeps Deckard company,who just looks so old and puzzled?I have a thing about black dogs?
There's a poignant moment in the story near the end when a powerful artificial force rams into an even more powerful and relentless natural force that engulfs it and sweeps in and out,which do you think wins?It is the classic AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE AGAINST AN IMMOVABLE OBJECT.This is a true GIANT OF A SCI-FI MOVIE that is meant for the big screen,it wont be the same watching it on anything smaller.The end of this leaves two wide open doors into a second movie and hopefully a third,a trilogy in the making.Where Rick Deckard finishes what he started all those years ago and leads an Android ( Replicant ) siege war against the humans especially against corporate humans and WINS!Enjoy,enjoy!God bless all,Escapism forever!",2017-10-22T15:27:40.000Z,0

I knew it was not going to top the original Blade Runner, but was really excited after watching multiple trailers...

Unfortunately I have to say this is really one of THE WORST sci-fi movies I watched in years. I dont know but the movie is very boring and without character at all. It seems like Hollywood lost its golden spark of the 80s -- the screenplay and character development were so bad I was literally falling asleep... and what about that overhelming sex theme and nudity present throughout?

The music is good but there's little poetry in it. 3. You won't be quoting famous lines from it in years to come. The good is that I think Ryan gosling in Drive mode is pretty much perfectly cast - he is engaging throughout, and the film does widen the blade runner universe. It's much better than Prometheus.

We know it didnt go well in the boxoffice just like its predecessor,but who fucking cares !! ITS CLASSIC !! ITS A MASTERPIECE !! ITS A FILM Intelligent people will be talking about for years. 
Ridley Scott ....This is how we pay the proper respect to classic films. You screwed ALIEN with that Gibberish of yours called PROMETHEUS. What a trash Film. Then Covenant..another shitty film !!   I hope from now on you learn how to make distinguishable films. 2049 is the perfect example how a movie should be made, no matter its a sequel ..prequel...etc...
Look at Blade Runner 2049 again...its eerie environment,its visual,the tone,colors,camera movement,details,lights,shades, narrative...score!!!..EVERYTHING IS PERFECT !! Dystopian to the Core. IT upgraded the first one to a whole new level without losing its magisty.
The experience i had while watching this film shall never be forgotten. I was immerse...bringing back old memories from the time when I watched the first one decades ago. I was all there but 1000 times better. My dreams came true.!!! I could die in piece now!!
Introducing new characters......narrative is simply fantastic..script rules.....the actors....my God !!! The actors....JOI is heart loving..amazing and type of woman that a man has always wanted to have.  Supportive,smart,kind,fair,sincere e allways by a man side.

Hope u guys can have your money back by lauching other films such as IT for example. Only 35 million dollars..and returner more than 600 million ! profit made !!
BLADE RUNNER IS THE MOST XPECTACULAR MOVIE of 2017. Forget about Star Wars. This is a kid blockbuster film..nothing more
BLADE RUNNER is the kind of film that makes you think,makes you move ahead,makes you go deep inside and provide you with interesting questions about AI, Humanity,real not real and Science. Moral Values...what life really means....What a soul really means.....endless possibilities...zillions of questions...I feel like the movie should never end...always asking for more.!!!
SCOTT...u have destroyed ALIEN but you will not destroy this one!!

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"When Deckard said Rachael was special, he wasn't kidding. Director Denis Villeneuve does a commendable attempt to pay tribute to the first movie, but that's like trying to make Citizen Kane II. Like the original, it's a visually intense movie, but each scene is not a work of art per the original.

The sound track is heavy and disjointed in spots, and spot on in others. Acting across the board is excellent, even if Gosling still not my first choice, he's solid. If this movie falls short anywhere compared to the original, it's in the dialogue. The original had dialogue I still repeat in my head once in a while, whereas this movie, I can't think of a single scene that will stick in my head. The evil genius in this movie is more a side character, unlike Tyrell, who was one of the most compelling characters in the original. 

The movie both pays pays homage to the original, with some characters and scenes being very reminiscent to the first, and many original to this film. By this review one might think I didn't enjoy 2049, but that's not the case at all. This is a must see movie for fans of the original if for no other reason you get to immerse yourself in all things Blade Runner for almost three hours. I don't think it really added anything to the story per se, but it's one of the better movies I have seen in some time, and any time a thinking person's sci-fi movie is made, must be applauded.

In 1982 Ridley Scott and co. imagined a (retro)future unlike any other and made such a monumental film. Over the years we have become so familiar with androids on film and fiction (Although earlier literature existed), that the original Blade Runner will not impress newer film-goers much and convert them. But as a product of its time, everything about the movie was innovative and still holds up very well, down to the effects and score. In comparison a 2017 release of a sequel doesn't have to tackle much in terms of a visual style or substance since they have already been well established. I feel in that sense, we haven't really imagined real sci-fi in years. I enjoyed 2049 since it didn't destroy what the original was or dumb it down with mere action. But I still feel the original had a momentum alongside its philosophy that the new one replaces with stares, silences and pauses.

- 1st Blade Runer 1 hr 57 min second 2 hr 44. Everything has its limit, world building as well. Arrival tells me that Mr Villeneueve has problem with time management in his movies.
- Normally, real movie makers do not have problems to make a good fashion detective work and love story at the same time, you do not have to wait 2 hours where action somehow starts.
- In Good old fashion detective story, you do not have feeling that you know the answer at the very early stage.
- Regarding Harrison Ford, he plays in this move Han Solo (Indiana Jones - no difference). Is it because he can play only that role? My point is: 70+ year old Han Solo is pathetic (new Star Wars had the same problem), don't you see this? There was endless options how to build that character, but it was another Han Solo.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,i have seen the movie and it could have been only a hour and a half if they didn't use A FUCKING MINUTE LONG PAUSE BEFORE THEY SPEAK. it's shit and it's not only for that reason. Half of the movie is just bad and meaningless. The only emotional moments is when Deckard's dog gets blown away with deckard and K (also known as Joe) but it survives so it's ok. the only good thing in the movie is that it's based in the future.,2017-10-16T09:05:07.000Z,0

I couldn't follow what was going on from the first minute and had absolutely no interest in what was going on. It's not a movie for a general audience and several people left before the end at the screening I attended. It is not catering for those that like action or story driven drama.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"I actually saw this movie, and I didn't like it. *WARNING TO EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO WATCH THE MOVIE, DO NOT CONTINUE TO READ WHAT I HAVE TO TYPE!*

The entire movie was slow-paced. It was almost 3 hours, which I cannot watch an movie that is so close to that time period. I can watch Forest Gump and Star Wars (since these movies are also 2-3 hours at least). But this movie literally was half of a waste of time. Like there are parts I cannot understand why they need to include in this. *UH I HOPE PEOPLE WHO HATE SPOILERS ARE GONE!* There is this part where this harlot and the main character were going to have sex, and the scene went by so slow, that in the other half of the film it seemed like that happened in another movie. It was so slow that it should have been a two part movie. It was a good movie with a great plot, but I did not like how it was all put into plan. I fell asleep a couple parts of it, to be honest. My dad and I ordered a large popcorn and it was a big container. About 40ish minutes in the movie it was gone. We don't chug down popcorn in movies either (just to let you know that incase you think the reason why the popcorn didn't last long because we choked ourselves with the popcorn xD). But yeah, if you do not like sitting in uncomfortable movie theater chairs (if your near theater didn't upgrade the seats) for 3 hours, then I don't recommend watching this. If you want to watch this when it comes out in dvd, have at it. BTW when I saw this, the theater had the surround sound so loud my entire body was shaking. Even my dad, who listens to Metallica on full blast, even complained how loud it was.",2017-10-16T04:48:07.000Z,0

- it has pace of snail on the walk, it is really hard to survive 2hr and 43 minutes, 
- shots are too long or irrelevant for a story at all,
- some of those shots were created only to show art of photography and design. They do not have any sense for story telling and additionally they are slowing down the pace of the movie. That's why around 1hr 30 minutes poeple start to pray for finish (I wasn't the only one),  
- who had idea to bring Harrison Ford again? Indiana Jones and Han Solo 30 years later ? Really ? He plays the same type of characters, exactly the same. He looks pathetic, just pathetic,
- dialogs omg. Please give up on pseudo intellectual crap. That move does not carry anything relevant, pretending it does only makes things worse.

The story was eh, but it held my attention pretty well. 
There were some boring parts, but not many at all and they were quickly set aside by something else. 
Probably my favorite thing about this whole movie, though, was the music. It's like the movie was made for the soundtrack and not the other way around. The music told the story just as well, if not even better than the dialogue and characters did.

I never expected much action from 2049 - if any.  With that said - this movie bored me to death and there are plenty others saying the same.  Seriously dragged out. I think the reason people are defending this movie so viciously is because they can easily do it with the backing of the critics. It's apparent that this will be obtain a cult following like the first - but to say that it will be a cult classic? This movie will be quickly forgotten once the hype fades.,2017-10-15T00:01:57.000Z,1

I knew nothing about the first blade runner and I only just watched it the day before I saw this film. Whilst I still liked the original, it didn't quite do it for me so I was then sceptical coming into 2049. I should not have been. This film is without doubt the best film of this year, probably the best scifi of the decade and has nestled its way into my top 5 list. Don't let this film flop. GO AND SEE IT. You won't regret it.

it's extremely VERY RARE to see this type of movie (genre)...which I always wish people could appreciate it more...
but in reality, again...this is not the type of movie for everyone, obviously... (not the typical ""mainstream / hype"" trending / action-superhero blockbusters type of movie)
futuristic, sci-fi, dystopian, deep, smart/thoughtful, philosophical, speculative, artistic, imaginative,...with many deeper meaningful layers & metaphors/symbolism...with a very unique & peculiar 'irony' & 'emptiness' feels & tones 
heavily reminds me of ""The Matrix"" trilogy, the recent ""Ghost In The Shell"" earlier this year, which -again- have always been my favorite movie genre!

Blade runner 2049 is fascinating, brilliant , intelligent , insightful, gripping and smart piece of filmmaking. You can clearly observe and see how this is a work of an artist who respects the craft and with each movie tries to make a name for himself. This movie works on so many levels starring from stellar performances , great script , interesting and fleshed out characters , intriguing story which by the way plays out as detective investigation for the most of the film, mind-blowing direction and cinematography combined with excellent production values and eerie compositions. I also enjoyed  reversed psychological approach this movie makes with making its protagonist replicant in search for his possible human heritage while the original had human doubting if he is replicant. Great thing about it and not everyone can achieve that is how you get reasoning behind every character no matter if they are good or bad and you understand their actions so they don't end up being generic cartoon characters like in some sci fi films.  2049 is everything modern sci fi needs, it has its own identity and for my money it gets perfect 5 out of 5.",2017-10-09T13:55:01.000Z,0

The images are formidable footprints of lyricism, morbid fairy tales, very contemporary. The shots are amazingly stunning surprising with colors whose tones are reversed the warm colors are icy and vice versa. but depressed at wish, with a Ryan Gosling, marble, a Harrisson Ford that appears much too late in the film, and a deafening music that terrorizes ... It is a dystopia that could have been very successful because Villeuneuve addresses the dear themes to humanity, who is it? What is man's own? Is it to have memories? Is it the fact of having a soul? Can it happen again? it is approached sometimes in a subtle way sometimes not ... The film is too long, too contemplative, without real scenes of actions and when they exist they too are too long without punch. Of course, we have the right to a love scene mi real mi virtual , where one wonders where reality begins, hence the questions of memories, real or implanted memories? Villeuneuve sees the future with spleen and melancholy, it is certainly a choice and if the first opus of Blade Runner could look sad, there was a kind of underlying hope ... Here it is mortifer ..
I advise the film for those who like me adore the images, a frantic aesthetic unparalleled, I advise against the film, for those like me adore the SF and blockbusters SF, the contemplative is good but 2:40 is too much!",2017-10-09T07:20:15.000Z,0

You think there is going to be a jump scare so many fucking times because of the God damn BRRRRUMMMMMMMMMMS and other noises but it never happens... Once...

Being genuine, it was the most boring piece of well funded shit I've ever seen in my entire life. It only begins to get good in the last quarter and even then it's just not very entertaining.

I had seen this with my family and I thought it was just me who found it underwhelming; turns out they were pretty disappointed too.

I acknowledge that like 99% percent of people in the comments are saying stuff like ""omg! This is the best movie I've ever seen"" and that they think that it's amazing and what not, but this is just my honest opinion: It seriously lacks in action, it's over complicated (at least for people who hadn't seen the first movie) and it's waaay to slow paced.

This is a movie for those who enjoy it's lore, but if you don't understand it/don't give a shit about the over complicated lore, then you'll be sat bored af in the cinema for two and a half hours.

Don't get triggered at me, it's just a disclaimer for anyone considering watching this that your time and money could be better spent (cough cough Kingsman cough cough the Golden Circle) errrhem.",2017-10-08T19:40:36.000Z,0

- Great sound design
- Very nicely shot
- Great music

Now on to the bad
- Extremely weak story
- Zero character building
- Harrison ford was nothing but a prop in the movie... and a weak one at that
- Jared Letos character = Huh?. 
- Way to long movie.... could easily have been a 1.30h movie, not 3

I mean, it has some very obvious fan service introduced indecently early (in a unlikely scene given the adversary). But it doesn't have the totally neo-noir feel throughout of the original,  or the spellbinding lines, or the showing of industrial imagery always with a decaying mystery to them, rather than a cathedral-like awe of them. It could have used Ridley Scott's touch in some of the places where it looks just like any sci-fi film. The question of what is a real relationship, the depressing idea of could an artificial relationship be the most moving one that someone have, is the most interesting in the movie and that largely happens when Ana Da Armas is on screen in her various scenes.",2017-10-06T17:53:23.000Z,0

Movie is painful to watch because it doesn't seem to be aware of that there is no substance. I'm a fan of Denis Villeneuve but this is by far his worst movie. Technically it's good. Weird pacing. No atmosphere. Movie just keeps getting worse towards the end of the film. Few scenes keep you alert and interested but 80% of the movie is a failure. I can enjoy most dystopian movies like Stalker or Mad Max.

It's like watching your favorite singer have a really bad day.",2017-10-06T16:53:30.000Z,1

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"Interestingly enough Jared Leto's character is wrong, most civilizations were built not with slaves, but paid workers. Sure there was slave labor, but many of the major cities we know of today started off as forts, built so the people who lived nearby could go there if they were in danger. For example, many of the Celtic/Gaulic peoples (Gauls were Celts, not all Celts were Gauls) utilized indentured servants. This was a common system all over the world, until Caesar committed genocide against the Gauls...the Romans decided slaves were property. Now that doesn't mean Roman slaves were never freed, many slaves became powerful and wealthy during and after their freedom.¬†

Now yes, the Russian serfs were slaves, but they didn't really build civilization, mainly they farmed for a wealthy noble. What really changed Russia was Peter the Great, with his love for western style sailing, and really everything Western Europe...which he then forced westernization on Russia..",2017-10-06T11:27:36.000Z,0

DICK'S NOVEL ""DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP"" ADAPTATION COULD BE A POSSIBLE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS. VILENEUVE'S CRITICAL ACCLAIM IS MUCH GREATER, THAN HIS REAL ABILITIES. THE CAST OF THE SEQUEL SEEMS TO BE A MISTAKE, IT'S EXAGGERATED LENGTH IS APPARENTLY DUBIOUS . I THINK, WE ARE ABOUT TO SEE THE ""DISSAPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR"". THE MOVIE SHALL NEVER BREAK EVEN, ALTHOUGH IT IS GONNA MAKE THE ""PRODUCTION BUDGET"", AS GOOD, AS THE 1982 MOVIE, BUT IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME CRITICAL SUCCESS.
HAVING SEEN THE MOVIE I SHOULD SAY, THAT IT IS FULL OF VISUAL EFFECTS AND PROMISING PREMISES, BUT IT'S NEVER-ENDING PLOT, TOO SIMILAR TO THE ""STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS'""(AND SIMPLIER, BUT FULL OF RUDE, REPULSIVE VIOLENCE), IS A MESS.

I will expect this from blade runner 2 aswell. Because I watched the first part and its deleted scene compilation more than 20 times, listens to the soundtrack for 10 years now and red the book 5 times. And Harrison Ford is not thankful for being such an Icon he is with Solo or Deckard so fuck him, should go into retirement stupid fuck. Jared Leto sometimes he is very good like in Requiem for an overrated Film or Dallas Buyers Club (he was actually pretty good in it). But then he sucked in Suicide Overhyped Squad and raped the figure of Joker. Heath Ledger was pretty good but not brillant like Jack Nicholson were. And so we will see next week what will happen!

Movies now days dont contain any message, they are plain excitment and as soon we live theater they are gone out of our mind like book with empty pages.

This trailer just looks like any blockbuster with more guns, effects, explosions and more braindrain dialogue. Hollywood just can¬¥t take the risk to loose 50% of the audiance in a reasonably abstract dialogue lasting more than 10 seconds. But what made Blade Runner so special (and hence a blockbuster fail I guess), was those poetic lines with undertones of beeing and existance... ""if you¬¥ve seen what I¬¥ve seen with your eyes.."" and ""....all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die"".",2017-08-30T21:38:43.000Z,0

Blade Runner is a masterpiece...we grew up on it, we all know the lines,...nostalgia, it was a world and vision that stood against time and was ahead of it's time. Simply beautiful. I'm excited for the next major breakthrough and evolution of Blade Runner, but fear and apprehension that this next installment will fail if they decided to cut corners, not in line with history, or committing as much as they did during ""dangerous days"" (production of the original).

I loved the music, the futuristic sci-fi colors and atmosphere, and the actors. I saw Denis' name came up as director and Ridley Scott as exec producer, and I was instantly excited because I knew that from these 2 guys' amazing works in the past, this will automatically be amazing. Yet all I knew about blade runner was that Ridley Scott made the original with Harrison in the 80s, and it had gotten some of the best reviews I've ever seen, from both critics and fans. Last night I saw the original's final cut remastered, went back to this trailer, and NOW I'm officially excited. If you're new to Blade Runner, what hypes this movie up for fans is the theme music, the part where Ryan gosling wants to ask Harrison some questions, and the shiny eyes of some characters that Jared Leto has. If you haven't seen the original Blade Runner, DEFINITELY see it! You'll get what's going on right away, and you'll be just as hyped. Great cast and team putting this together also.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"Refuse to watch this - It looks like heretical junk in every respect.  Maybe I'm just nostalgic or old-school, but I'm not interested in trendy actors and over-baked plots. Just look at it - It's got all the hallmarks of cheap imitation, meant as a commercial cash grab. Full of fake CGI and shallow characters. Too fast, too overwhelming, too forced, too many explosions, not enough love or personality to it.

Blade Runner was an Original that cannot be replicated (intended) - A saudade meditation and study in cyberpunk atmosphere lovingly crafted through deliberate slow pacing, careful visual design (Syd Meade), pain-staking perspective shots, old-school special effects, and analog synth-wave meant to mimic orchestral movements, done by a master (Vangelis). It created a sense of beautiful loneliness, isolation, and melancholy, of a living breathing futuristic city. You could smell the rain and neon in every scene. It created an emotional depth greater than the sum of its production parts.

Moreover, the actors were participants who spoke little, and their dialogue left space to breathe in between sentences, allowing the viewer to soak up each scene. The underlying theme was they were dealing with an existential crisis that was bigger than themselves - there was no-one to blame, no real enemy - almost a tragedy of sorts. And yet they could
 have been anyone on the street - you or me. 

I'll leave you with this - to ""get"" what Blade Runner is all about, what I'm talking about here - One only needs listen to Vangelis' Blade Runner Blues, while keeping the spectacular visuals in mind. It is truly one of a kind Sci-Fi Noir movie that was inspired by the culture and technology of decade it lived in (1980s), and its vision of the future still echoes with us today. I highly doubt this sequel can live up to it, and nor should it - You don't mess with a classic.",2017-07-17T23:52:46.000Z,0

Why?

The first Blade Runner was awesome precisely because it was a dark, moody, noir trip _that did NOT appeal to the lowest common denominator <cough>Siskel&Ebert<cough>._

In fact, everything that made the original so incredible,  caused it to BOMB at the theaters and it was only kept alive by people like me (yes, the hard core OG fanbois) wearing out our Beta copies with repeated viewings until the masses caught on 10-15 years after it's release.

They've basically turned the tale into a formulaic action movie cash grab that appears to look and flow no different than ""Elysium"" or the ""Total Recall"" and ""Judge Dredd"" remakes.

<sigh>

Yeah, I'll definitely check it out on Kodi (eventually), but if these trailers are any indication, there's NO WAY ""2049"" will be even REMOTELY on par with the original.",2017-07-17T16:25:22.000Z,0

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"If Harrison Ford wasn't in this movie then I think I'd be more excited for it than I am. Not that I don't rate him as an actor, I really do, but it ruins the entire point of the original Blade Runner. The whole point of that movie was to examine the meaning of being human and humanity itself through the use of existentialism, and letting the viewer determine what and who Deckard actually  is. 

Casting him in a Blade Runner movie 30 years after the original was set ruins the ambiguity of the whole movie and kind of diminishes the point of it, because it sort of confirms he isn't a replicant, despite the original strongly hinting that he was a replicant. Even Ridley Scott claimed he was. Yes, the book was written with Deckard as a human, but the movie, like Fight Club, is its own piece of media, and is so highly acclaimed because of the themes it explores. 

Unless the movie comes up with a really clever, and I mean really clever, way of explaining things to do with Deckard, then it will sort of ruin the legacy of the original.
With this in mind, the cinematography looks fantastic and the casting choice also looks really promising. I like the kind of neo-noir feel to it that the original also had, so in that respect it does look good, it's just how they handle the story and characters that makes me slightly apprehensive.",2017-06-20T18:10:18.000Z,7

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"""Every civilization was built off the back of a disposable workforce. But I can only make so many..."" -- Neander Wallace (Jared Leto)

Here it sounds like Mr. Wallace, who is a replicant manufacturer, can't keep up with demand. Replicants only have a four-year lifespan, so the pressure to manufacture a great number of them must be immense. It's too much. Hence his statement that he ""can only make so many.""

At 1:32 we hear about something being ""finally unearthed."" Wallace then sends a female operative to ""bring it to me"" -- presumably the secret that has been unearthed. Is it possible that what Wallace is hunting for is the secret to creating replicants with longer lifespans?

If that is true, then perhaps Deckard is a replicant after all -- but one of the ""special"" replicants who have lifespans longer than just four years. And perhaps Officer K (Ryan Gosling) is the same as Deckard. Indeed, we are told that he too is ""special""...",2017-06-10T22:17:30.000Z,2
2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"Looks as if they totally sensationalized and flanderized what was in the original movie and book. ""There is an order to things... that's what we do here..."" the writing and acting sounds so over-dramatized - I just don't like it. Assuming she's a law enforcement character (could be wrong), compare her dialogue and tone with Byrant's when he brings Deckard in; Byrant sounds natural, like a guy who works a job, has bills to pay, and isn't really thinking of all this high idea stuff but is just trying to get his job done (it's even better in the book). This is a complaint I have about more than just this new BR but more less about new movies in general. Everything is so big in scale, over-dramatized, and ultimately dumbed down. ""The key to the future..."" What? In the book the androids and technological advances aren't being made for such lofty ideas; they're being produced for more realistic purposes like making a profit or bringing pleasure. It's just like what happened with both Jurassic World and the new Star Trek films.

And yes I realize that this could just be the trailer, but I'm not going to get my hopes up. I'm honestly not a big fan of the original film, but I do respect it on a number levels. This new film looks like a - slightly drier than most - new movie with Blade Runner's skin. Honestly if you want to get the best experience with this world than read the novel by Philip K. Dick. I'm reading it right now, and I absolutely love it. Existential questions, what religions can be brought about by technology, nihilism and other cool themes, jobs in the new world, way more exploration of the world and action than in the original film (even the original film doesn't compare IMO).",2017-06-10T19:54:20.000Z,0

Writers: Hampton Fancher (Blade Runner) and Michael Green (Smallville, Heroes, Logan)

Cast: Ryan Gosling (Half-Nelson, Lars and the Real Girl, Blue Valentine, Drive, The Place Beyond the Pines, The Big Short, The Nice Guys, La La Land), Harrison Ford (Star Wars, Apocalypse Now, Indiana Jones, Blade Runner, The Fugitive), Jared Leto (Fight Club, American Psycho, Requiem for a Dream, Mr. Nobody, Dallas Buyers Club, Suicide Squad), and Robin Wright (The Princess Bride, Forrest Gump, Nine Lives, Beowulf, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, House of Cards, Wonder Woman)

Cinematographer: Roger Deakins (Shawshank Redemption, Fargo, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, Prisoners, Sicario)

The cast and crew are EXTREMELY impressive, and continue to fuel my hope for this sequel.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"At the end of the first Blade runner, we all wondered how long Rachel would last and whether Deckard was a replicant.  Sean Young went nuts so rachel isn't in this one, and Deckard is now played by a guy who is 70.  Are there questions?  Are there answers?  Does anyone really care?  Hollywood just want to make money and theaters just want you to stuff your face with corn.  CGI, lame dialogues, explosions, and no plot at all.
Don't expect there to be any amazing memes or underlying philosophy.  That went out a long time ago.  This rehash is a cheap ripoff, where the producers don't even care about the material, and fanboys waste their time trying to hold onto their childhood in a cheap ripoff and reboot studio system that dumbs down everything for a foreign audience that didn't understand what the first movie was even about, cause that was American.  This generic dumbed down crap has all the visuals and some of the really old actors, but it is just a cheap ripoff to make money on nostalgia and vague enough for people who didn't understand the culture behind the first movie to not be confused.",2017-06-08T05:30:10.000Z,0

I can't see with good feelings how some people earn money with their fantasies by using other person world. Is like if tomorrow some moron could start writting the Fourth age for Tolklien's universe and he sell it like if that could be canon... Is just pathetic like this movie. A total nonsense under my point of view. And its content hasn't any valure for definition. And of course, it wont add nothing to the Philip's story.

We have the director of Arrival, Prisoners and Enemy. Ridley Scott is excutive producer. The same composer from Arrival and Sicario (another film by Denis). What's so bad? The original Blade Runner wasn't a financal hit, so how is this a cash grab? Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor (Drive, La La Land, A Place Beyond The Pines) and so is Harrison Ford. And while Jared Leto's previous perfomance in Suicide Squad wasn't great, he did a fantastic job in Dallas Buyers Club and even took an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.

Now don't misunderstand me. If they have different music in the movie that's fine. A new composer wants to make a name for themselves. But they should use some of the melodies from the original movie. This is a MAJOR gripe I have about ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" Had he used elements from the John Williams Star Wars soundtrack it would have greatly improved the viewing of the movie.",2017-05-29T07:37:08.000Z,0

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"I always thought ""Blade Runner"" had a dual meaning or many in the first movie. ""The path to God (or salvation) is like walking a razor's edge"". If a ""Blade Runner"" is a replicant, than it could easily sense other replicants, within a proximity area, despite being informed about them beforehand? Like a sixth sense. Another meaning is to focus on tracking a replicant despite the distraction of modern technology around them. I think another would be escaping other blade runners ( by being chased by one as a replicant), blending in with the rest of the crowd apparently  unoticeable to everyone else around them. I hope Ryan Gosling can top Harrison Ford's performance in the original. Tough act to follow. Hopefully, he's (Ryan) smarter,  more agile, and quicker (in terms of evolution in the movie set in the future) than Harrison was in the original, so to speak. Just an idea. :)",2017-05-19T05:54:23.000Z,0

It's interesting how the original was actually considered a box office flop because it came out at the same time as 'ET'. But over time (thanks in large part to VHS) it became the most influential sci-fi film ever. Wildly original and visually stunning. I'm not gonna watch this version because it was probably put together thru audience-testing and focus groups (Boooo!). Ryan Gosling has too meek a voice to be an action hero and Jared Leto is a scenery-chewing hipster. I'll pass.,2017-05-13T17:19:32.000Z,0

That tells me that there is some enthusiasm for this.  That pleased me, as it looks like a very fine sequel.  it seems to have lots of moving parts and what they've done with the music gave me goosebumps.  I hope they'll be using that theme.  

A key point of the trailer that sticks out for me, that ratchets the conflict, is when Gosling says, with that steely glare, ""I want to ask you some questions.""  Oh, man.  It looks like the mystery will be answered with some finality.  I really can't get a fix on the plot, what's turning the screws, but I don't think I need to know more.  

The cinematography is gorgeous, of course.  Thank you, Roger Deakins.",2017-05-13T13:51:16.000Z,0

The perfectly recommendable film; no personality, nothing to rub anyone the wrong way. The Aliens were hands, the spaceship was a textureless smooth object, the two main love interests had absolutely no chemistry, the animation was glaringly bad (like it was daring you to criticize it), doesn't even follow the original short story. And great, that same director is doing Bladerunner Fuck. It looks like Bladerunner + Mad Max + Dues Ex. Jared Leto as Tyrel? LOL.

Spoiler warning:¬†Plot or ending details follow.

Shortly after his activation,¬†David 8¬†is interviewed by Sir¬†Peter Weyland¬†in a palatial lakeside apartment, and David expresses his confusion at having to serve humans, despite being immortal and, in his eyes, superior. Many years later, the colony spaceship¬†USCSS¬†Covenant¬†is en route to the planet Origae-6, carrying over 2,000 colonists in¬†hypersleep. Still more than seven years from its destination, the vessel is struck by the shockwave from a nearby stellar ignition, causing major damage and starting several fires on board. In response to the crisis, the ship's crew are awoken from hypersleep, although Captain¬†Branson¬†is incinerated inside his cryotube when it fails to open. The surviving crew manage to bring the disaster under control, although 47 colonists are lost alongside their captain.

The¬†Covenant's first officer, the highly religious¬†Chris Oram, assumes command of the mission. While undertaking a spacewalk to conduct exterior repairs, pilot¬†Tennessee¬†picks up a fragmented, distorted transmission via his suit's communications systems. When the message is analyzed on board, the crew are able to discern an unidentified human humming a classic rock song within the image. When they trace the transmission to its source, they find it originated from a nearby planet perfect for human habitation, better even than the predictions for Origae-6. Presented with a seemingly perfect home just a few weeks away and with none of the crew wanting to re-enter hypersleep after witnessing Branson's fate, Oram elects to investigate. Branson's wife¬†Daniels¬†officially protests but is overruled.

Upon reaching the uncharted world, Tennessee,¬†Ricks¬†and¬†Upworth¬†remain aboard the¬†Covenant¬†in orbit while the rest of the crew heads to the surface in a dropship to explore. They discover a verdant world ripe in vegetation but mysteriously devoid of animal life. As they explore, one of the security team,¬†Ledward, disturbs some small pods, causing several airborne particles to enter his ear unnoticed. Further searching leads the ground team to a crashed¬†EngineerJuggernaut, inside which they find a¬†dog tag¬†belonging to a ""Dr.¬†E. Shaw"", as well as the source of the transmission they received. The expedition is cut short when Ledward becomes rapidly and violently ill.¬†Karine¬†rushes him back to the dropship, whereupon a¬†Neomorph¬†erupts from his back before attacking and killing Karine. In a desperate attempt to kill the creature, dropship pilot¬†Faris¬†accidentally shoots several flammable tanks aboard the ship, causing an explosion that kills her and destroys the craft; the Neomorph escapes. Outside,¬†Hallett¬†is killed birthing a second Neomorph from his mouth, having also been infected by the pods.

The Neomorphs, already grown larger, soon return to attack the crew on the ground. The armed security team manage to kill one of the creatures, while the second is scared away by a mysterious hooded figure. Unable to contact the¬†Covenant¬†due to ionic interference and with the ship unable to breach the planet's powerful atmospheric storms anyway, the crew follow the mysterious figure. He leads them to a nearby ruined city, strewn with the bodies of dead Engineers. Upon reaching a vast temple at its center, the figure reveals himself to be David, survivor of the¬†USCSS¬†Prometheus. He explains that he and Shaw came to the planet ten years previously aboard the Juggernaut; however, the ship's cargo of weaponized¬†black liquid¬†accidentally deployed over the city when they arrived, annihilating its populace and contaminating the planet. The Juggernaut then crashed, killing Shaw and leaving David alone.

David and the¬†Covenant's own¬†android,¬†Walter, a later version of the same model, spend time bonding in the temple. However, David soon becomes disappointed in his successor's lack of capacity for emotion and higher thought ‚Äî aspects of his own design deemed dangerous and subsequently removed ‚Äî and kills him. Meanwhile, the surviving Neomorph, now fully-grown, infiltrates the temple and kills¬†Rosenthal. David discovers the creature feeding on her corpse and seems to communicate peacefully with it, but Oram bursts in and shoots the Neomorph dead, enraging David. When Oram threatens him, demanding to know the truth about his actions on the planet, David leads him to a laboratory, where he presents his efforts to genetically engineer a superior lifeform from the creatures spawned by the black liquid. He leads Oram onward into a chamber in the lower levels of the temple, where several¬†Eggs¬†of his creation reside. One of the Eggs promptly opens and Oram is subdued by the¬†Facehugger¬†that emerges.

David waits and watches as Oram is later killed by the¬†Chestburster¬†it lays within him. When the remaining security officers go to investigate, Sergeant¬†Lope¬†is also attacked by a Facehugger, although he is saved when¬†Ankor¬†cuts it off of him, badly burning Lope's face in the process. Ankor is then killed by the fully grown Alien while Lope flees. Elsewhere in the temple, Daniels confronts David, correctly guessing that Shaw did not perish in the crash. David confirms that he killed Shaw during his experiments before attacking Daniels. She is saved by Walter, who, as a more advanced synthetic than David, is able to self-repair. The two androids engage in a brutal duel as Daniels flees. She and Lope manage to contact the¬†Covenant¬†and Tennessee launches a rescue in the ship's cargo transporter sled. Daniels, Lope and Walter make it aboard the small ship, although they are pursued by the Alien. Daniels battles the creature aboard the flying craft, finally crushing it in the vessel's remote crane.

Upon returning to the¬†Covenant, the survivors prepare to re-enter hypersleep. However, Daniels and Tennessee discover Lope has been killed by a Chestburster. The Alien quickly slaughters Ricks and Upworth as they shower, but Daniels and Tennessee manage to corner the creature in the ship's terraforming equipment bay, finally succeeding in ejecting it into space. As they return to hypersleep, Daniels realises too late that it is not Walter who is aboard the ship with her ‚Äî it is David. She cries out in vain as he activates her hypersleep pod. Now alone aboard the vessel, David enters the hypersleep bay full of colonists, looking upon the hundreds of bodies in stasis, before regurgitating several small Facehugger embryos and placing them into storage.",2017-05-11T13:02:48.000Z,0

And this trailer kinda does the same thing, they're sorta making it out to be this action film, which is dumb cause I'd rather make a trailer that fits the movie, even if it doesn't appeal to the general audiences. That way it attracts the people who actually want to see the movie instead of tricking people who came to see explosions but I guess that wouldn't make them enough money.

it's been a couple weeks; maybe even a month since i left my last comment on your last video. it had my soundcloud link in it and it even got 8 thumbs up, even if half of them were from ex-baby mama's hoping i make it so they can get that child support money. I even got a reply from a nice noble man named Matt and he suggested that you see it.. but you didn't and im getting impatient and my pockets are gathering dust. I have 4 and 1/2 kids to feed and ive been posted on bus stops and street corners tryna sell sheets of paper with my soundcloud link on em, but all that resulted of that was a crackhead stealing the box i was holding all the papers in. pls se√±or sharpie. this is the last letter i will write and if my 1/2 kid dies its on u. <3 ur vids btw my neighbor watches u all the time, and i just watch along while im peeping thru their window while they're undressing.

(test administered to Leon to see if he is a replicant) the postmodern elements, bricolage of noir (detective, femme fatale,) sci fi(self-explanatory.) aztec tokyo la architecture etc. It had the visual effects but they were extremely credible thanks to the use of the practical physical stuff that we see the actors interacting with (the cars that leave steam when they fly off,  the market scene which is incredible world building) not to mention the amazing performances of Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, etc. Frankly Gosling and Jared Leto don't do shit for me.

because remakes are mostly shite, with remakes of classics insultingly bad, and filmmaking today is very stale indeed..  lots of comments about the bland looking Rich Evans, whoever he is. i've never heard of him, he seems instantly forgettable though, so i *may* have already 'seen' him & forgot. no distinguishing traits about him come across in this trailer, maybe everyone else watches too much TV where i assume he's from. and what's with all the idiots bringing race into it ?  they must have real issues just going down to the shop in the normal world.. dumbass SJW hypocrites.",2017-05-10T22:35:05.000Z,0

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"I read the novel before I saw Blade Runner way back when and although the movie was incredible I remember leaving the cinema thinking, 'the book was better'. From what I can see of this trailer, this new version goes even further away from what made the novel so impactful.  The novel presents a shabby, diseased world suffering the effects of a kind of low-exchange nuclear war where so many humans are now genetically damaged and most animals are extinct. Not some dark, gleaming megalopolis. In the novel the replicants are androids. Soulless versions of living creatures. Their superiority is physical and mental but not spiritual. The central premise of the novel is that living things have, to various degrees, empathy. And that living things need other living things around them to excite empathy and to keep the desire to live going. The replicants are attempting to replace humans and might succeed. But humans have been drawn to a new religion called Mercerism that involves entering an empathetic vision world with the help of an electronic device. Something no replicant can participate in. It was all so much more subtle and tragic than the movie. And this trailer shows the unfortunately lifeless effect that CGI can produce and from what I can see, presents a vision of a dystopia not much different than any one of the others in movies made  in the last 15 years.  And if it is about Harrison Ford having a half-human, half-replicant son, well, thanks, I already saw 'The Force Awakens'.",2017-05-10T19:49:22.000Z,0

That Man was created to be a servant of the gods did not strike the ancient peoples as a peculiar idea at all. In biblical times, the deity was ""Lord,"" ""Sovereign,"" ""King,"" ""Ruler,"" ""Master."" The term that is commonly translated as ""worship"" was in fact avod (""work""). Ancient and biblical Man did not ""worship"" his god; he worked for him.‚Äù Excerpt From: Sitchin, Zecharia. ‚ÄúThe 12th Planet.‚Äù",2017-05-10T16:29:17.000Z,0

It feels like it's probably a choice just to help give this movie some cred with fans and add another big name to draw people to the box office and it feels like it was probably a compromise by the writers that won't actually add much to the movie. I mean I don't have much to go on to be fair, but a movie like this should be fairly straight faced sci-fi. It shouldn't be over the top where it doesn't need to be and with that said what are the chances that a in character who in the grand scheme of things isn't important within this movie's world would factor into an amazing story twice. Maybe Gosling is a replicant of the same design and that's why, but if I can guess that from a trailer then that's poor writing in itself.",2017-05-10T12:45:07.000Z,0

And not only that, the plot seems lacking, it doesn't seem as deep as once was. Is more like an action movie, not a movie that makes you think. The women in the trailer are not hot either hahahhha, all the girls specially Daryl Hannah and Sean Young where hot as hell back in the day, and they were unique too.

Two writers (First alarm bell... Scott fuckering around already???)
Hampton Fancher wrote the original Bladerunner screenplay. Nice BIG gun right there then... 
& Michael Green, who wrote Green Lantern (Awwww shit!)
Scott brought in Damon Lindelof to rewrite Prometheus. Look how well that worked ffs!!!
THE saving grace could be Denis Villeneuve, who most recently directed The Arrival. He also directed the brilliant Prisoners, starring Huge Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaall.

Ryan Gosling will be Deckard and Rachael's son somehow, being the first human/replicant hybrid. That's why he's so ""special."" His birthday is October 6, 2021.

I'll just watch the original instead.... to whoever cast him for the lead.....you should be fired or beat down to a janitorial position. You clearly didn't listen to the die hard fans. fans that had ALOT to do with this even being remade. keep doing stupid shit like that and your financial gains will not be gaining so much....keep hiring the wrong people for these huge budget movies and the people won't go see the movies which means your taking a HUGE loss!

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"Rather impressed with the trailer.  Cinematography is top notch, Gosling brings along his delectable noire persona, Joi is beguiling and deceptively innocent while Ford resurrects the cut and dry Deckard of lore (an early model with rudimentary emotional buffers).  Leto is trying too hard as usual and channels the Joker in his Happy Birthday comment (tone it down about 70%) while Leto's assistant appears wooden, from her inelegant walk cycles to her pretend stare.  The new Spinner is a clumsy design compared to the original and reminds one more of a failed electric car startup.  I do like that they at least threw in an ode to a Syd Mead conveyance at 1:52.  They also resurrected the original farm scene with Bautista (good casting) - I personally liked the off world intro better.  As an aside, it would have been a much more interesting dynamic if Bautista played Leto's role.  Surprised Ridley is involved with Yorkin again considering Yorkin never did understand nor admire or respect the original.  Overjoyed that Fancher finally gets his much deserved turn at the helm.  Ridley's crude handling of Alien Covenant left me a bit in shock but his selection of Villeneuve seems to be on point.  So far so good.",2017-05-09T18:21:43.000Z,0

From the musical choice, to the set juxtaposition shifting with the dialogue. The whole thing has really solid theme at it's core. And that theme of coarse is minimizing Jared Leto's role in the film. From the visual of a limp lifeless body spilling onto the ground during Leto's first voice over to give us a nice visual of his dead pan acting. Then the studios all flash their logos as if ashamed to be associated. 

The next time Leto damns this movie with his voice over we are treated to shot of some dirt being brushed aside, which can only be a metaphor for where they found the script. Finally punctuating Leto's horrid voice over with two loud pistol shots probably an Easter egg to the two writers Hampton Fancher and Michael Green committing suicide after turning in the script.

Sorry I'm not a fan, He is as believable as a block of cheese, with two goggly eyes that are disturbingly close together. Ok that was harsh..
The film looks beautiful..
I just feel he was miscast for this film, (and most of his roles of late)

I know my dislike of his acting, is kind of irrational.. 
Hummm? Why? I think it literally is the placement of his eyes, they are close together, and his eyebrows (he needs to stop over trimming them) And his little up turned mouth, always Looks like he has a perpetual smirk. even when he is supposed to be sad, or mad. He looks like a little kid that's up to no good.. It's weird how it bothers me. 

Yet He seems Like a nice guy out in the real world.
When I saw ""La La Land"" I wanted to love the movie, I wanted to like him, But I could not believe in his performance, I could not relate, even though there was a lot in that film for me to relate to. In the end I felt the film was over rated, very pretty with some nice songs, and heart, but .. But not best picture worthy ..

He just looks Meh in this, I really don't buy him as a Bladerunner.. But maybe I will be surprised but I doubt it..

But this is a Beautiful Looking Movie, and I will go to see it.. At least once ...",2017-05-09T07:09:25.000Z,0

You were never really clear on who was the protagonist in the first one. Yes it was Harrison of course but Roy at the end threw us all for a loop and became ""More Human than Human"".

Harrison Ford had grit to pull off Deckard in the original. Gosling looks childish to the point of being comical. Seriously, I could not stop laughing because of the hysteria ensued for I naively expected a masterpiece. On introspection, what I actually want is Blade Runner 2, with all the same actors, scenery, score and execution. This is not happening and hence my mind is refusing to accept this fact. My, my....Also, the other guy, Leto, ""I can only make so much"" with eyes of an owl, just looks like a hipster psycopath, no finesse in his execution as Joel Turkel brought back in the day to play Eldon Tyrell.

Remember, the original set an unreachable benchmark:story, cast, visuals, designs, pace, execution, score. This is already lacking in the actor department. Oh well. Feels bad man.",2017-05-09T06:19:17.000Z,47

The trailer is lame, looks too clean and generic, Ryan Gosling and Ana De Armas absolutely do not fit Blade Runner types - they are cute, but that's it. Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott  are sell-outs.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"Rather impressed with the trailer.  Cinematography is top notch, Gosling brings along his delectable noire persona, Joi is beguiling and deceptively innocent while Ford resurrects the cut and dry Deckard of lore (an early model with rudimentary emotional buffers).  Leto is trying too hard as usual and channels the Joker in his Happy Birthday comment (tone it down about 70%) while Leto's assistant appears wooden, from her inelegant walk cycles to her pretend stare.  The new Spinner is a clumsy design compared to the original and reminds one more of a failed electric car startup.  I do like that they at least threw in an ode to a Syd Mead conveyance at 1:52.  They also resurrected the original farm scene with Bautista (good casting) - I personally liked the off world intro better.  As an aside, it would have been a much more interesting dynamic if Bautista played Leto's role.  Surprised Ridley is involved with Yorkin again considering Yorkin never did understand nor admire or respect the original.  Overjoyed that Fancher finally gets his much deserved turn at the helm.  Ridley's crude handling of Alien Covenant left me a bit in shock but his selection of Villeneuve seems to be on point.  So far so good.",2017-05-09T06:34:09.000Z,0

Blade Runner was already a cult classic, and it was mysterious and really fit the cyberpunk motif... Making a sequel just spoils the mystery, and spoils the original.... Why is Hollywood so obsessed with taking movies that don't need a sequel and making them... I'm pretty sure the reason they do this is to attract people that want nostalgia, and make money safely... They know it's easier to get ticket sales when it has Blade Runner in the title, but that's scummy I wish Hollywood would just try and make NEW stories, and not live off of sequels... Blade Runner was good, it didn't need a sequel it told it's story... Sigh...

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"Here is my prediction on the story since they revealed so much in this trailer.

Gosling finds out/discovers that he is a Replicant. We find out that the Blade Runner's were always Replicants. He searches out Rick Deckerd because he was a Replicant that somehow figured out how not to die.

Why do I believe that? In 2007's making of the Final Cut Documentary for the 25th anniversary release, Ridley Scott said ""Deckerd IS a Replicant"". I highly doubt he would allow the writers to change that fact in his mind.

So Deckerd has survived after all these years and Gosling needs to figure out how ""to survive"".

There is your movie Blade Runner 2049.",2017-05-09T04:12:43.000Z,0

I really don't want to hate on this without giving it a chance, but this sequel looks like every trailer for every wham-bam, watch-and-forget franchise of recent times. I know everybody is very excited (as they are when they see every new Transformers, Superhero and alien invasion movie trailers). Nothing changes. Movies like this aren't made to be good - they're made to be passable while raking in millions of dollars. They count on (and rightly so) the short memories of people (weren't you all jumping up and down at the last Superman trailer?) and they do well, and Hollywood bangs out more and more and more. I'm sure this will look aesthetically blockbusterish and loads of people will see it and then X-Men 12 will bring out a new trailer a month later and we'll all forget this one and jump up and down and it will begin all over again. It's a shame that they can't just let beautiful things rest gracefully in peace.",2017-05-09T03:40:51.000Z,0

I'm not saying 2049 will be better but who knows yet for sure? Yes, I highly doubt that. Still, this film *DOES* have a *HUGE* potential to being just as damn near perfect as Scott's Blade Runner.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"So Ryan Gosling is a replicant, and also a blade runner, just like Harrison Ford. He wants to ask Deckard how he fixed the ''4 years protocol'' (because Deckard obviously live now like a human, and got old because of Methuselah Syndrome). This is what the replicants creator (Leto) means when he talks about the ""key for their survival"". Because if the replicants can fix the protocol, humans cannot control them anymore: they surpassed their creator.

My other theory is even more crazy: Deckard discovered some way to make a children with a replicant woman (Rachel). But she probably died in the process and the baby is Ryan Gosling character. Think about it: 30 years passed since Deckard ran away with Rachel, right? So... In this movie, Gosling seems to be around 30 years old. The ""page missed"", in the end of the trailer, could be probably this information (that book looks like some ""birth registration"", for the replicants). What do you think, people?

Idk bout all the haters but I really feel like this one is right in line. Plus it has some quality actors like Ford still, Gosling, Bautista, & Leto.

I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannh√§user Gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.

- To be honest I think 2049 will be very far to be a masterpiece as BLADE RUNNER. 

BLADE RUNNER is a masterpiece in form and substance, with all the gearing moving fluidly. It's a very baroque and stunning movie, steps ahead of other sci-fi movies. Now, in 2049 everything looks like tons of other movies, totally steps back. 

2049 sound very familiar as the mistake of: ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" sequel of another unrepeatable sci-fi masterpiece like: 2001: A Space Odyssey

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"I hope they stick with the film noir style of the first. The foundation of the original Blade Runner was, first and foremost, a noir detective story. It was all about a cop tracking down and ""retiring"" replicants. 

The cyberpunk aesthetic and the ""what does it mean to be human"" message that came from it were a result of the writer and director's vision for this detective story (Ridley Scott said it himself that he was so inspired by the noir films of the 40s and 50s that he wanted Ford's character to also wear a fedora along with the trenchcoat, but ultimately decided against it since it would end up looking too similar to another one of Ford's projects during that time: Indian Jones). 

I believe that in order for this film to be great, it needs to remember that the story has old film noir, detective story roots. If it focuses too much on the extras (like aesthetics for example) then I fear it will not capture the essence of the original, and what made it great. If that occurs, then this movie will just end up in the ""not-as-good-as-the-original"" pile, and will quickly be forgotten. Hope I'm wrong!",2017-05-09T02:36:05.000Z,0

I wonder if they continue that here, or pretend it didn't happen... I wonder how much Harrison Ford is in the story (or Sean Young, if at all).

Looks good. I will give it a try. And it sounds like the music from the original. I wonder if Vangelis is doing it.

Also look at those peeled of an egg ""actors"". This looks the same as Transformers because of them.
Hollywood is dead, because it's ruled by financial interests only.
It's ruled by people who say this and that have to be in the Film to get this focus group into it too to make more money out of it.
Also: The original Blade Runner told its story. God i LOVE this Movie. But there is no need for any second part. 
It just gets worse, by killing the mystery of the original. The Question, is Dekker a Skin job? Obviously not, because he is still alive. 
I should just ignore this Film completely. But I'm afraid i will watch it for the visuals anyway.",2017-05-09T01:30:17.000Z,0

I used to run a very popular Blade Runner site in the¬†90s and I was totally obsessed with this film.¬†Ryan Gosling and I went to the same high school. I talked to him but didn't know him that well. It's crazy to think that someone I knew and saw almost everyday is going to be in the next Blade Runner film. Couldn't have imagined that in a million years but wow.

Sicario was almost SciFi in its other worldly window into an alien version of Mexico. The soundtrack was 80% of Sicario and if anyone can compile an essence to Bladrunner I'm hoping Villeneuve can. He's been quoted about using as much practical sets and effects since the original was created so I believe he can hold it together.

We've already got Bladerunner and to expect ""another"" Bladerunner experience is ridiculous... Enjoy the sequel to a movie you already understand and love.....and check the Jaded baggage at the popcorn counter.... if not, go make you own new sci-fi movie.",2017-05-09T01:18:11.000Z,0

He has never made a bad or even 'okay' film yet, at least on a critical level. The cinematographer is also Roger Deakins, one of the best working today.  The personnel is top notch - people who know what they're doing.  Just because Ryan Gosling is frothed over by many women doesn't discredit him as a 'cheap' actor.  When directed right, he's a great actor, like in Drive and The Place Beyond The Pines.

I'm usually very skeptical of sequels of course, but that's because the intention is always purely to cash in.  But knowing the people working behind this film, I can put faith that they're passionate in making this film something special.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"The story and the screenplay are by Hampton Fancher, the same man who took Philip K. Dick's novella and created out of it the screen play Blade Runner, and created its dark noir setting.  Fancher did not write Blade Runner's opening and annoying voice over, nor attempt to leave the viewer wondering if Decker was himself non-human. The original scripts, more than a dozen, remained true to Dick's original conclusion on whether an AI being could acquire a true consciousness.  Ridley argues for it, totally disregarding the original creator's point of view. As long as Fancher is on board I am quiet anxious to watch the sequel and see how faithful Ridley is, or is not, to Dick's argument on what is that element that makes man a man.",2017-05-09T01:02:35.000Z,0

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"This trailer is pretty disappointing. Blade Runner often feels like the only true cyberpunk movie, managing to realise the almost hallucinogenic descriptions of urban life in the future like in Neuromancer, while maintaining a fixation on the real message of the genre: technology will not save us. Innumerable benefits will be found with technological progression, but the ultimate mundanity of life will never cease. You've got a new bionic liver from a Japanese megacorporation but you've still got to pay the rent and feed your drug habit. There are also unsettling implications about the diminishing 'value' of a living person in a world of overwhelming scale and technological sophistication. All of this, conveyed in the style of a pulpy detective noir story. It's a masterpiece and it left you thinking for years after it finished.

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"Dialogue seems a bit hammy with too much exposition, preferred the more understated dialogue of the directors cut (not including the Harrison Ford monologues), and I hope lines delivered in the style of, ""I always told you, you're special"" aren't  previews to the rest of the dialogue (not that it's terrible, just mediocre Hollywood by the numbers stuff).

Visuals and sound look good, but there's been some definite dumbing down, there's now a more obvious villain, and a hamfisted android apartheid plot (echoes of the Ghost in the Shell plot turned into Robocop for the Hollywood remake), if you set your expectations to something around the Ghost in the Shell level or slightly better and are happy with that, you'll likely have a good time.

Hollywood making a great sequel or adaptation is an increasingly rare phenomenon, probably due to high levels of creative bankruptcy in the industry (and that lack of creativity is the reason they seem to keep trying to mine the past).

It seems that today we are basically sold by super-hyped trailers to go and buy tickets. The majority of Hollywood movies seem to lack some deeper meaning, some message. Everything is just plain and visually beautiful.  The original Blade Runner was not only revolutionary for its visuals at the time, but more important, it was a philosophical movie. It was a movie that asked some existential questions.  And, the ending of the original was great because it left us with all these unanswered questions that every individual may direct and answer in its own way.  It left the possibility of discussion. Having the questions answered in the sequel leave us with nothing, it simplifies the whole concept of the primal idea of the Blade Runner story and universe. The other thing that doesn‚Äôt work for me, is casting big Hollywood names in a movie that is under so much pressure to bring something new. Casting Gosling was wrong, it just seems like this is not only a sequel to Blade Runner, but also to Drive and Only God Forgives. I think that they should have brought an unknown name to play the main character.",2017-05-08T21:49:30.000Z,0

The Armor of God
10¬†Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11¬†Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil‚Äôs schemes. 12¬†For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13¬†Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14¬†Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15¬†and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16¬†In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17¬†Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
18¬†And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord‚Äôs people. 19¬†Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, 20¬†for which I am an ambassador in chains.

 that Vangelis wont be doing the soundtrack, but I still wish it the

-I want kickass cinematography and atmosphere. (Which we will get 
fortunately, thanks to Roger Deakins and his awesome cinematography)
-Please don't make this movie end up a mindless action flick like this 
trailer made it out to be.
-But above all else, PLEASE PLEASE, use practical effects and 
miniatures! Easy with the CGI too!

Now, the same director will bring us _Blade Runner 2049_ .   But okay, let's be fair here and just focus on the trailer. I'm missing the certain... ""something"" that Blade Runner had.  The constant rain, the depressive atmosphere, the (pseudo)philosophical talks... A Trailer is a alway like walking on a razors edge. One have to show some action and some calm, quiet moments, but of course not too much from the final film.  That goes especially for Blade Runner.

First read ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"" thirty five years ago then saw the move Blade Runner. Blade Runner is one of those movies that gets better every time you watch it. Very much looking forward to this movie. Great to see that Deckard has a bigger role than I previously thought. Actually linked to the plot rather than just there to pass the torch to the next generation. Great to hear that iconic music as well. Did they actually get Tangerine Dream and Vangelis together for this, or some of the great modern ambient artists? Too bad we won't be seeing Zhora, Pris, Rachael, Roy Batty, Leon or Tyrell again. :-)",2017-05-08T20:05:07.000Z,0

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"This looks like a vanity project for all involved. 
Ryan ""Pretty Boy"" Gosling flexing his Drive clout by playing up the silent and tormented protagonist role. Every frame with him in it looks eye-roll inducing and also indicative of Denis Villieneve shameful attempt to cement his status in the imdb top 250.

Harrison Ford is there too, desperate to cling on to the virtues of his youth, despite destroying each of his iconic roles in the process. I'm sure old man Decard in a Hanes t-shirt throwing mediocre punches was oh so integral to this story. Reminds me of his role in Return of the Jedi where he spends the majority of the time trying to hack into a door, essentially playing no real part of the ongoing story. Even Ford himself admitted he should've been killed off long before in Empire. Why is Hollywood so intent on keeping Harrison around? Do we really want to see a 90 year old Indiana Jones come 2020? Give him new roles. 

Denis is a mediocre filmmaker coasting on his unabashed pandering to pseuds by employing cinematographers like Roger Deakins and cultivating his visual style to something that can be chalked up as ""the thinking man's Zack Snyder."" I'm sure Warner Bros. is even aware of this seeing as they're sculpting him to be their new go-to director.",2017-05-08T19:51:03.000Z,19

2017-05-08T16:35:21.000Z,gCcx85zbxz4,BLADE RUNNER 2049 - Official Trailer,"This looks like it could be shite. The lines sound cheesy, like they are all trying to exude the importance of what they're saying. If they really are a part of this world then they're not going to be philosophizing about every little thing. AI robots have been around for decades so what's with all the grandiose talk. The cinematography looks technically excellent but there isn't a lot of grime or claustrophobia, or a distinct/coherent look to the film. The first film was very film-noir, cramped and dirty whereas in this I see a lot of different color palettes and styles, all very clean. In that sense it could be Total Recall or any other sci fi sequel. It's been through some dramatic color correction and that's too obvious. I'm not crazy about the casting choices. Nor am I crazy about Harrison Ford reappearing. He was what he was in the 80s and he doesn't have that charisma anymore, so it seems like he's there as a piece of nostalgia, handing off the mantle to Ryan Gosling. This type of thing worked ok in The Force Awakens, and it failed miserably in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but I've seen it twice already and I know I'm not interested in seeing it again. The little I've seen of Leto makes him look like a clich√© god figure, with none of the mystery or uniqueness of Tyrell in the first movie. As for the music I'm worried that jazzing up Vangelis' main theme with modern tropes is like putting big fake tits on an Audrey Hepburn lookalike and calling her Audrey Hepburn 2.",2017-05-08T19:03:37.000Z,0

That's not necessarily a bad thing, mind you, but it could end up deviating hugely from its predecessor, in both storytelling and pacing. We'll just have to wait and see, but since it has both Ryan Gosling and Villeneuve in it, I'm inclined to give the movie the benefit of the doubt",2017-05-08T18:04:01.000Z,0

Denis Villeneuve is an awesome director, but I don't know, after watching this one, there's something off about it. One of the best things about Blade Runner is it's pace, the movie is so slow and yet so powerful I don't even know how it works to be honest, 2049 seems too big, too fast, and I get it. It's obvious they would try to make it into a sci-fi action blockbuster, the movie is too expensive to be slow and contemplative, but I thought they would go in that direction when they announced the director, since that's what he does with his films, but with much smaller budgets. I was naive, and although it looks cool, I'm extremely sad and disappointed.
The dialogue is also too obvious, too expositive for my taste, it reminds me of Jonathan and Cristopher Nolan stuff, which is pretty bad since I find their movies quite shallow, which is the opposite of how I view Blade Runner.",2017-05-08T18:07:49.000Z,0

It was unique: a philosophical sci-fi noir film, more theater and tone than blockbuster. This trailer is a bit flashy, most likely the doing of marketing and editing. We‚Äôve probably already seen most of the gunshots and explosions in this film. 

Part of the beauty of the original, in all of its versions, was its ambiguity.  Was Deckard a replicant? What happened to him and Rachel? Based off of the trailer it appears the audience will get some answers. This could be a bad thing‚Äîor a good thing, but chances are slim. If anyone can do it, Denis is the guy. More likely is that he will retain most of the original‚Äôs ambiguity. I hope he does not answer too many questions‚Äîadmittedly I don‚Äôt think he will: he is a delightfully talented filmmaker whom I have faith in. But my faith is swayed when dealing with a story‚Äîa legacy‚Äîof this size.  But that is the nature of sequels.

Don't get me wrong the cinematography can't be denied but everything looks so 2017. Too many pretty people running around in an environment that looks like it was set up to film a perfume commercial. Hopefully the plot proves me wrong. Still think it was unnecessary to bring back Ford. I was fine with the ambiguous (origami) ending of the Final Cut version.

Villeneuve is top notch so it feels like we are in safe hands especially as Ridley has been off the boil for years. My only concern is that some of the design and replicants (costumes, hair) look too 'safe' compared to the original. Remember Rachel's hair and makeup? everything had this future noir - Jean Paul Gaultier feel about it... A heavily stylised future where as this feels like it wants to be more grounded and realistic.  Not necessarily bad, just more obvious. There was something quite organic and mystical about the craft flying over the skyline, the rain and the cosmopolitan streets filled with grime and neon.",2017-05-08T17:06:32.000Z,17

By the way, for the people who say Hollywood can‚Äôt make something original, well there are 3 book sequels to the original book. Don‚Äôt blame Hollywood for having a good director along with the original director make a sequel to a movie that still has a lot of ground to cover.

Also for all the people who say that this movie ruins the speculation of if Deckard is a replicant. Well based on the books, he isn‚Äôt. Nevertheless, we all have our own opinions, and I am so hyped for this movie.",2017-05-08T16:36:39.000Z,6

I wish it was shot on film rather than Digital, but it's Deakins. Deakins is the
