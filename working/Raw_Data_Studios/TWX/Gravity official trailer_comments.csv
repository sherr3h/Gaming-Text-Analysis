üëç REALITY - Do you know Gravity does not exist. This is an ""Unscientific Imagination"". Due to which, science is going in the wrong direction and even today ""Universe & The¬†Theory of Everything""¬†both are remains an unanswered question for us.¬†I am proving it through a unique and simple experiment.

üëç PROOF - If you really believe that gravity exists, then try to show the direction of the force of gravity through the arrow. Just like, by the arrow it is possible to easily¬†display the direction of each force, which exist in the universe.

üëç EXPERIMENT - Suppose the apple is falling on the earth due to the earth's gravity or attraction, then how will you show the direction of this gravitation or attraction of the earth through the arrow, on your Copy or Board?

What I mean to say is, when drawing the arrow, where will be the head of the arrow? on the side of the apple or on the side of the earth?¬†¬†

üëç RESULT - I challenge you by this experiment that, in deciding, your brain will 100% failure. Because in fact, Gravity Has No Existence.

üëç SUGGESTION¬†- But, what is that force, which is actually¬†working in the place of Gravity? For full information, click -¬†https://youtu.be/q_Zqr0cUcI8¬†(Please Watch full video of 8:07 Min.)",2019-08-14T04:31:06.000Z,0

The second thing was the unbelievable unprofessionalism of this woman. You‚Äôd think that they prepare astronauts for space missions much better. I wished her to be dead in 30 min into the movie.

Cinematography was sublime
plot was minimalist but effective

writing was a tad silly

acting was bad on Clooneys side, he plays the same shmoo over and over again

Definitely would not agree with all the people in these comments saying it's ""the best movie ever"" because it's far from perfect. But it definitely proved itself to be unique and different in a good way that worked out better than I'd have thought, which was refreshing.

Like Proserpine , Bullock comes back from the hell which is the black space to  return to the land of the living, our planet. The astronauts are lost when they are without oxygen and jets in the space, like material corpses without life but still with a spirit or soul, as the space is the land of the dead, of the  lost souls  of the dead and you can only survive there with a lot of appliances to keep your body alive as if you were for a time on a trip in the land of the dead, the space.",2016-10-08T11:25:49.000Z,2

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],This is not actually a movie. It was WB's attempt to get rid of an annoying actress. What you are seeing is actually real life footage of Sandra in space where she thought she had won a celebrity seat to the Space Station via a Shuttle. Both were barely usable mocks of the original. WB had worked with NASA to rid themselves of this awful actress and this is actually a documentary on how close they came to succeeding. You have been informed. Thankyou.,2016-08-18T00:28:39.000Z,1

The score, acting, visual effects, writing, editing, pace was far better in Interstellar. I'm not even a fan of space movies but Interstellar blew my mind. It really annoys me that Interstellar didn't get as much attention as it deserved, even though it won 1 Oscar. But compare it to Gravity (which won 7 Oscars) is an absolute disgrace for a movie which is just good movie, not exceptional in any way. . But not an Oscar-worthy film. The story was yet another generic space rescue film. I believe Interstellar is extremely underrated. It was one of the best cinematic experiences that I've had. The movie made me emotional and I think it is very unlikely we'll ever see another space film so original like Interstellar.",2016-04-20T22:48:15.000Z,3

First the hospital/anaesthetists said nothing went wrong. Then the consultant anaesthetist (my call to him in desperation) said it was 'awareness' (meaning what's usually called anaesthetic awareness in the UK or unintended intra-operative awareness in the USA). Then this same man at the end of a farcical meeting said I had experienced 'emergence phenomenon' - but decided not to tell me what that was. Then in response to my letter of complaint the Chief exec wrote that nothing went wrong and didn't use any name for what had occurred - supposedly just my abnormal response to normal events. They contacted my GP and told him something but I asked him and he refused to tell me what he had been told. He said at one point 'they didn't know what went wrong' - but of course they must have = a lie.

You'd think (with all their expensive legal expertise paid for by clients/users of their services = us) they'd have created and stuck to one coherent and consistent story wouldn't you?

Yup: suffocation is a terrible way to die and many of us will die in this way. It is utter HELL. I survived it but others have died and will die in hospital because of medical errors by anaesthetists, surgeons, operating department practitioners (ODPs), nurses, recovery room staff etc. A weekend so no senior staff  on-site, agency nurses, poor training for all concerned, arrogance, incompetence, misdiagnosis,not listened to or believed (before and after)...

Can't fix it after (nor my injuries) so it's GOT to be prevention: 'saving' money kills and destroys lives and costs far more in the longterm - but only IF our and our friends' families' lives and health are given their correct value.",2015-11-11T20:32:56.000Z,0

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"First off, This movie is awesome! Second, I'm sick of seeing people comparing this film to Interstellar and arguing about which one is better. Thats like comparing apples to oranges and arguing about which fruit is better. But in all seriousness, Gravity got a bigger opening, a better Cinemascore, better reviews, more oscar nominations, more oscar wins, and a bigger box office than Interstellar. And Interstellar had no 3D. Interstellar and Gravity are two completely different movies! Also Interstellar was a stupid movie. I saw it on cable. It had way too much plot holes I mean it focused way to much on planet jumping. And it focused on love way too much. It was like watching Twilight in space only worse. Also the acting was terrible. I like Anne Hathaway but she should have never done that movie. Same with Matt Damon and Michael Caine. It doesn't help that Matthew Macaunhey was in it. His movies aren't good. I  rather watch like 4 Justin Bieber music videos than sit through Interstellar again. Its no wonder Big Hero 6 did better than Interstellar when it came out. Plus Big Hero 6 was THE better movie. Gravity on the other hand was a masterpiece. It had better acting, a better story, better effects and it had the best 3D since Avatar. Its one of the best movies to watch in a theater. Sandra Bullock was great in it. Plus Gravity got a better tomato meter score than Interstellar. On Cinemascore, Gravity got an A while Interstellar got like a B+.

There is a different premise for both films. Try and remember this. The only similarity of both these films is the setting, which is space. And that is all. Gravity, a lady who is trying to return to earth. Interstellar, people that are trying to leave earth. Can't you see? Over all, for a film, I would like to watch what is entertaining, and of that I choose Interstellar. Interesting plot, interesting premise, character development, more emotional instances. If I would like to watch a more down to earth film, which bases more on plot situation more that any other element, then its Gravity. And if you notice, the film is in real-time. Everything happens in almost 90 minutes or so. The film is also more believable and laid back. You just watch what happens. For Interstellar, you have to think in order to get the gist of the movie, and it looks like a handful of people were having trouble with that. But Gravity is missing the awe, the ""what if"" and imagination, stepping out the comfort zone. So the aim of both films are different. But I'll say this.

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"I think there are a lot of points to take into consideration , when discussing gravity , not only because it is one of the most highly rated movies of all time , but because it has created such a big division not only among science fiction fanatics but among movie goers in general . Let us get one thing straight . Gravity is a good movie , Is it the best sci_fi I have ever seen ? Absolutely not . did it break the mould ? yeah somehow , but not necessarily because of its presentation or ideas , but more because most of the sci_fi people watch nowadays are so mainstream they mostly worship action , cliches and aliens . gravity in all its essence is really a very simple story about survival . something more akin to cast away than star wars . If gravity was a book , then it would be a short story , not a novel . Back story that is so important in character arcs is not fully exposed on purpose (they could have used flashbacks for example but they didn't) , all you need to know about sandra bullock 's character is that her daughter died , and that she has been living in sorrow ever since .They never fully explored the main character for a few reasons . This is my interpertation of course : Firstly they wanted you to be fully invested in the setting as much as possible , and secondly maybe they thought it would be a tad melodramatic and cliched . Visually speaking , the film is stunning , that every scene so painstakingly crafted is a story in its own . Gravity is not only a simple story favouring symbolism over conventional storytelling but also a visual experience that makes up for its lack of dialogue through prestine , thought provoking imagery that will haunt your dreams for how lonely and dark space can be , yet so beautiful and endless that it would take your breath away . That is why it is so crafty , a single frame can make up for thousands of lines . That is why so many adore this movie . My brother who is a very hard to please kind of person thought it a perfect movie and gave it a 10 . It depends really on your kind of personality . He saw in its simplicity and hauntingly beautiful imagery a story in its own . He loved clooney 's nobelity and liked bulock's fight for survival . But that didn't make it the best movie i ever saw . Yeah the visuals enhanced the atmosphere dramatically and yeah I liked clooney's character . I just never felt for sandra bullock's character . Maybe I demanded more backstory , maybe the role needed a lesser known actress , I just don't know ¬†. Visual imagery was indeed striking but iam one of those people that far favors emotional investment in my stories over gorgeous visual imagery . Simple strorytelling is a double edged sword in movies , and lack in character backstory would have been forgiven if i was emotionaly invested in the fight or if the premise was more original , but neither was the case . But as i said before , gravity is more than the sum of its parts , and I try to understand as much as i can, why people like it so much . It is just that I can't totally adore it or see it as a flawless movie as other people do .",2015-02-07T18:19:53.000Z,1

Now I am not trying to pass judgement on anyone.

However the most I see is how neither of us should waste our time because it sounds like a porno throughout the damn film. 

Lol, all I gotta say about that is, either we have a lot of people pretending that they've watched porn or they just felt like saying it just cause it sounded cool or were trying to sound clever. Either way, this never sounded like any porno I've ever seen. 

I think that in any heat of any moment we are unable to control how we sound or think.

I did not see this in the theater because I knew the scenes would make me dizzy and uncomfortable. I just watched it last night on a large screen TV, and it was over hyped, over rated and no way deserved Oscars except for the SFX. Just as many had observed when it was released it had no plot, no character development, lots of impossible events to swallow, but it was also BORING as hell when there was no explosions or fast flying astronauts to watch, Bullock fiddling with buttons and trying to grab onto parts of the satellites put me to sleep. In the Sci-Fi and Horror genres you have to be able to suspend disbelief when it comes to storyline, you mean to tell me that Dr. Bullock was able to get into a Chinese spacecraft and go 'eny, meny, miny, moe' and pick the right buttons to push to land her safely in the water of earth?¬† 2001 A Space Odyssey it is not, which is why it is being quickly forgotten.

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],Just another comment. Gravity gives you that sense of fear of being in space. The way the camera moved was perfect aided with visuals and sound. Interstellar was beautiful but too many red flags. It did not have the same depth of realness I guess I am trying to say. Just my opinion though.,2014-11-10T03:22:05.000Z,0
2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"Ok, here is the thing. Both movies are visually stunning. In my opinion Gravity is a better movie. Here is my rationale for my opinion. Interstellar is great to watch but it becomes a little weird towards the end. Interstellar is also not plausible meaning a lot that happened in that movie is just the figment of our imagination.
Gravity on the other hand is very real. Not one hundred percent but close enough. Gravity made me feel like I was there and made me actually not want to go to space.
In the end Gravity made space feel real, Interstellar did not. Both movies, again were very stunning to watch though. Just my opinion.",2014-11-10T03:16:51.000Z,2

I thought Cuaron and Lubezki did magnificent, they took control of the film and gave an intense and dramatic atmosphere, meanwhile, the story was irrelevant because there wasn't ¬†new but it wasn't about the story at all. It was about the atmosphere and the characters, particularly, Bullock's. Though many of you think Sandra was just whining, i beg to differ. Yes she was whining but it was damn necessary! She showed an amazing portrayal of a torn woman who's been hurt deeply and afraid to feel pain again but eventually got back on her feet and started to live again. Of course it was only possible with George's character and even though some of you might say he was cut off early, I think the time given in him was just enough. Again, this was all about the atmosphere/tone/mood and Bullock's character and in the that light, I thought the film was divine.",2014-08-09T14:07:59.000Z,34

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"From the positive reviews of this movie I expected something well researched, deep and subtle. In the end it was just another flashy American movie made for people with short attention spans and a lack of critical thinking skills.

If you know anything about satellites, orbits and space debris you might find it difficult to suspend your disbelief. How likely is it that debris from one destroyed satellite hits the Hubble space telescope, the ISS, several other satellites and a Chinese space station too? Multiple times, over multiple passes.

This movie goes from one suspenseful moment to another, to another, to another, to another and to yet another. After awhile I found myself rolling my eyes every time something went wrong. The suspense was fake and manufactured, I can only pretend to be genuinely concerned for the main character's life so many times before I get desensitized, because who am I kidding, she's not going to die, that'd compromise the feel good moment at the end when she feels reborn and happy to be alive! Can't have that.

Having said that, this movie did genuinely have me tearing up in the quiet moments between the flashy special effects and explosions, only to pull me right back out of the movie again with another moment I'm expected to get all tense over again.

Dialogue is a bit corny too, but I'm not really a person who cares so much about that.

I'd probably give it a 3 or 4 out of 10. If you're not too critical of movies and like allot of suspense in your films, then you'll probably really like this, because in essence it's not a bad film, it's just cheap and pandering, which some people are into.",2014-08-09T03:42:42.000Z,3

But if you want entertainment, which most people want, then Armageddon, Event Horizon, Transformers, Independence Day type movies are better to watch.

Imagine a man floating in space.¬†
He does not have any type of propulsion system such as a jet-pack or boosters.
He has an umbrella made of Kevlar which is spread open and tethered to his waistline.
The tether is several meters in length, is strength rated for towing, and is fully extended so that a tug on the umbrella will in turn be kinetically transferred to the man, via the tether.
The man has a wrist rocket sling shot strapped to his forearm and wrist that is in prime position for firing.
He has attached to his chest a pouch full of lead ball weights, each weighing about 3 ounces.
The man loads a lead ball into the sling shot and fires it at near full capacity into the concave side of umbrella (now you know why the umbrella is made of Kevlar ;).
The momentum of the travelling lead ball is transferred into the umbrella and the umbrella moves slightly in the same direction the ball had been travelling, thereby causing the man to move in the same direction as well.
As he fires one shot after another into the umbrella, the speed at which he traverses space increases with each shot.
When the man runs out lead balls to fire from his sling shot, he reels in the umbrella- which now retains the entire contents of his ammunition pouch.¬†
After retrieving all of the ammunition from the umbrella and placing each ball back into the ammunition pouch attached to his chest, he can now push the umbrella away from him in any direction he chooses, and can again begin the process of his sling shot powered propulsion system.",2014-07-31T03:48:43.000Z,1

Let's see, When viewed in an inertial reference frame, an object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. The vector sum of the forces on an object is equal to the mass of that object multiplied by the acceleration vector of the object. When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"Warning: this is an attempt to express my views on the movie. OPINIONS AHEAD! ""Meh. It was aight."" But seriously, I enjoyed Gravity to an extent. The action scenes were amazing and. . . well. . . that's about it. The cast was a poor choice. Watching Bullock ,(A trained astronaut.), fret for for her life like she did was just dumb. For ANYONE to be qualified to go on a spacewalk, ESPECIALLY to service the Hubble, that person would have had to go through months of training and preparation. Not only training for when it goes right, but when it goes wrong. In fact, a large portion of Astronaut training exercises focus on situations that go wrong, to prepare the astronaut for a dangerous mission. A mission, might I add, you wouldn't be chatting it up during. ""WHAT DO I DO WHAT DO I DO?!"" is a statement you should NEVER hear from an astronaut, and especially not a space-walker. And I shouldn't even mention the useless ""Oh you're running out of air"" mechanic that served no purpose. After telling her to breathe lightly, Clooney then proceeds to ask her about her life back on Earth. I call BS. I wouldn't have had a problem in a more Science-fiction movie, but this entire flick is meant to actually happen. And it can. And if they wanted to be accurate, they sure didn't do a good job. I don't feel like pointing out all of the movies flaws. But I must re-state: I did not hate this movie. I just think it was a simple ""cash-in"" on space to the general audience. The praise this movie is getting is(in my opinion) not deserved. I'm seeing this movie being put on number 1 spots on top 10 Space movies, or some other countdown. The word ""Brilliant"" is a VERY generous compliment to Gravity. Not to say that it sucked the big one, but definitely not the top of its class. If people are impressed and ""deeply moved"" by this movie, they are most likely new to the genre. Go watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. LOADS better.",2014-06-15T08:40:07.000Z,1

Thanks to IMDB user ""nysalesman"" for the review!¬†
""1) Bullock is nauseous during a space walk. This would never happen. It is only during space walks that space sickness can kill, because vomiting in your enclosed suit would cause you to inhale and choke on the vomit. It is for this reason that food is not consumed for hours prior to an EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) and astronauts are required to abort the walk when there's even a hint of nausea

2) Bullock is untethered,spinning and flailing in space. This is highly unlikely. NASA procedure is to always have an emergency MMU called a SAFER during EVA. The pack is programmed to automatically adjust yaw, roll, and pitch to stop the astronaut from spinning. Routine procedure is then to manually take control of the jetpack and use it to return to the space vehicle

3) The Soyez TMA re-entry module requires an EVA to disengage the chute. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that this model would allow the astronaut to disengage the chute from within the capsule. BTW, if the chute did deploy, it wouldn't have been opened up and spread all over the station. The parachute compartment hatch would have simply been blown off and the parachute would have remained packed away in the module - there is no wind in space

4) The opening line states that there is no sound in space. However, we hear the wrench actuating when used by Sandra Bullock

5) George Clooney has Bullock on a long tether to distance her from the jets on his jetpack. However, he's holding on to her in front of himself, where she is just as clear of them as he is. Also, the propellent is inert gas, so it would not have hurt her. BTW, Clooney later drifts into space when there is no discernible force to push him away from Bullock

6) The re-entry capsules have a hard 60-second count down before undocking. No way. Design of space vehicles offer manual over-rides for nearly everything. If there were a count down, then there would be an over-ride as well

7) One exploding satellite would not cause a chain reaction of debris. It's called space for a reason, there is a lot of it. Debris from one satellite is highly unlikely to cause further debris

8) Every satellite and space station is bombarded by the debris as if they are all in the same orbit. They are not. For that matter, neither is the Hubble and ISS

9) When Bullock takes off her space suit, there is no liquid cooled ventilation unit, catheter, or diaper: which are required attire for EVA

10) Bullock stabilizes and orients the proper re-entry path of the re-entry module from a spin while well beyond the window for a deorbit burn

11) No way someone with the emotional baggage of Bullock's character would ever be chosen for a space mission

12) Bullock went through astronaut training and wasn't taught to brace herself when using a propellent in zero G

13) The hatch on the Soyez reentry module is much higher and would not have flooded so easily. Additionally, the Soyez, while being designed to land on solid ground, is also designed with floatation devices for water landing and does not have explosive bolts on the hatch. So it would not have flooded like Grissom's Liberty Bell 7""",2014-04-30T14:39:57.000Z,0

The plot however is confusing, it's like they intentionally left it simple and straight forward. I personally believe that they made the plot clean for different reasons, one of them being to portray space in a realistic manner and to focus on the psychological parts of the main character. Bottom line is that if your looking for a traditional action sci-fi movie, this probably isn't your thing, but if you want to watch psychological drama that happen to be in space - go for it.

I just don't get something. Why did Clooney have to die? A tug in the tether would have brought them together. She could have just bend and try and grab the strings on the parachute and tug him back. He could have left the jetpack and push it on the opposite direction with his feet (it's conservation of the linear momentum. They even used that when she threw the fire extinguisher in order to squeeze that bit of momentum). Also why didn't she use the RCS system of the soyuz (the thing she used to stop rotating) in order to get some momentum towards the chinese station ?

synchronization affects inner time perspective, so in order the equilibrium
of external particle speed and inner time perspective as well as the maintenance of energy [E=mc^2] remain stable.

-------------------------------

questions
-------------

Does time flow with different rate among afar space and empty space close to a galaxy?

Do time-flow differences between empty space of relatively dense regions and afar voids, affect dark matter and dark energy?

Is dark matter and dark energy an effect of time on the Planck noise rate of particle generation
that fail to cancel each other?

If space dilates faster at some regions, then not only there is pitch lowering of fields, but
also informational elongation of transmitted data. Also all fields do NOT dilate with the same
rate, some fields like the ¬†Higgs field hate to dilate, so that friction among fields can generate
or consume spacetime. [inconsequent dilation among fields effect]

How does informational dilation of single fields [and also among different fields] affect the size of empty space?

How space chunks of different time flow interact among each other?
How now inside one space chunk fields that exist in that single one field
react among each other [the fields of a single space chunk] with their different
properties during dilation and space consumation? What affects has ""among fields interaction""
to spacetime of that region we observe?",2014-04-04T15:04:52.000Z,0

And yea, Sandra has to Do Research on it and suddenly theres the president and the World is on is edge to rott. And omg what is this? George cloony discovers ""the force"" kept within an artifact  and unleashes it,  bringing back a race which is only interested in destroying the universe,  starting with the earth!  I mean this Film is all about experience!  what would you Do in such a Situation? And Not alone in space. Debris appears Like Problems in real life now and then leaving you helpless in your little space Suite bubble. If you dont act right you might get lost!

The movie is not optimistic for space exploration but that's beside the point of the movie which is religious in its own way. Space is a completely alien environment which will be overcome.

It's about a POV-experience of being in space and struggling agaist weightlessness. The movie name says it all: it's about gravity (or it's non-existence). Consider the goal of the movie and then see if it meets it. It didn't promise to be a complex love story. It promised to be a good POV-experience.

It is SOO NOOOTT OVERRATED. If people are talking about it too much then it's for a reason. Because it's SERIOUSLY SOOO GOOD! I was intense all throughout the movie all anxious of what would happen next. I thought it an appropriate running time. That's excellent. That shows how well developed the movie is that they don't have to go in circles emphasizing the same thing over and over again. The beginning is perfect as well. We can compare the mood of it to the middle and the end. The end was lovely because it showed how she went through all and got a h+ll of a ridee. She was safe and sound. It really disturbes me when people talk bad about a movie who won MULTIPLE OSCARS! I mean, I admit it, i could of never had come up with such a well developed script. That goes for all of us!

Also the movie was 90 minutes (an hour and a half) and most movies don't go over two hours. About another 15 or 20 minutes added to the movie would have made it average run time. This movie was made pretty much just for the special effects which is why there's not much background on the characters. And honestly the effects are great and I think they did an awesome job.

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"Honestly, this movie is overrated. I mean first of all, the movie is too short. Most movies are more than two hours but this one was only about an hour. Also, the beginning and ending are horrible. Yes the movie is mostly about space but it doesn't mean it has to start in space. And the ending is stupid! I mean really she yes she does come back to earth safely, but it ends with her in the wilderness without anything to contact anyone with!

I don't know how it won so many awards. The script is boring, lacks imagination, lacks special effects. I even had to fast forward it a times.¬†
Star Trek and Lost in Space ( the early episodes) show much more imagination as well as a far more intelligent story line. If you have an above average intelligence then you must pass this by as it is a waste of time. Sandra Bullocks face lift is however suited to s/fiction though how you can class this movie in this slot is beyond me. The music is nothing original, just a lot of noise really, def not memorable.
Hollywood is suffering from an overdose of botox and cheek implants as it is obviously voted in by the people who have invested their money in this film.

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"I know this is a long post, but I feel the need to write it:

I feel compelled to post this message in response to the various amount of hate that Gravity seems to be receiving at the moment, especially on this comment section.¬†

I will stress now that for those of you who didn't like this film, I have no problem with that whatsoever! We all have different tastes and film is subjective at the end of the day. There are going to be films that many people like that you don't and vice versa. We all have different perspectives when it comes to films, so I think it's wrong for people to call you idiots or whatever.¬†

For me personally, I loved Gravity. I saw it in the cinema last November and I loved it. I bought the Blu-Ray yesterday, watched it last night, I loved it. It's my favourite film of 2013.¬†

Why do I love it you may ask? Well, first and foremost, it was because of the experience of being in outer space. Gravity is very much an experience film. A film that you're supposed to immerse yourself in and go in for the ride. On that basis, Gravity delivered that aspect for me. The direction, visuals, music and even the physics portrayed in this film helped that tremendously in my opinion. Just watching the visuals and seeing Sandra Bullock's character overcome the odds stacked against her was intense and absorbing. Because I felt like I was in space with her, I felt her emotions, I felt her loneliness, I felt her need to survive. Also, the end sequence? It gives me chills every time. It is an amazing sequence with the visuals and especially the music. It's a film that's not so much to be watched as it is to be felt and it's also a survival film.¬†

What annoys me about the reaction to this film is how many people just look for the bad things in it and they totally disregard the good stuff. Do we look at all the individual moments we hate or dislike in a film, or do we look at the bigger picture? I think it makes more sense to balance out the good and the bad of a film and see which one holds up more, instead of just focusing on the bad.¬†

One of the complaints people give is that it has no story. I disagree. It is a basic story, but it's still a story! A story about a person in space trying to get back to earth after a disaster takes place. After all, it is a survival film. There's only so much you can do with a premise about a person trying to survive a disaster or an event that arises. I mean, what were people expecting with a film like this? Considering the basic material Alfonson Cuaron had to work with, I thought he did a great job! The film also deals with issues like loneliness, despair, isolation, spirituality, etc, so there's more to this film than people give credit for. I've never seen a survival film done this way before, so Cuaron covered new ground with this film in my opinion.¬†

In terms of the physics, dialogue and cliches in this film? There were maybe a couple of problems, but they never really bothered me that much.¬†

It's in my top ten favourite films of all time and I don't care if people think I'm overrating the film or that I don't have a good taste. I loved the film and nobody will change my enjoyment of this film!¬†

At the end of the day though, if people don't like it because they found it boring or they couldn't get into it, that's totally fine. We all have different opinions and it's a shame that a fair amount of people don't like it, but I wish people wouldn't be as harsh on this film and at least consider the good aspects to it and I believe you can find many. Some people who call it the worst film ever made are just being WAY too critical in my opinion.¬†

If you think I have a bad taste in films, here are my top ten favourite films of all time so you can be the judge:¬†

10. Groundhog Day¬†
9. Inception¬†
8. It‚Äôs a Wonderful Life¬†
7. Brazil¬†
6. Gravity¬†
5. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy¬†
4. The Elephant Man¬†
3. Fantasia¬†
2. Vertigo¬†
1. 2001: A Space Odyssey¬†

I wanted to post this message because I feel that, while people are not wrong for disliking this film, I do believe some people are being a bit too harsh on it in my humble opinion. I mean, why do some people feel the need to be so aggressively negative towards to it? It's just a film at the end of the day.

Being an actor it's funny how many of you shit on Bullock but praise Clooney. Also this movie was a prime example of how direction, and top notch camera work can really make a movie, something the average moviegoer generally overlooks. The imagery, symbolism and contrast between several key frames was also emotionally stimulating and just pure beauty. Favorites had to be her drifting into space, spinning in iss airlock after removing her suit, inside her suit, and the final frame (spoiler).
Open your eyes people, movies like these don't get made too often anymore.

As much effort as they put in portraying zero-g physics as accurately as possible, there is a MAJOR error which I can't forgive the film, namely when George Clooney's character dies. I mean, they were at a stand-still, therefore if Sandra Bullock let go, they should have remained stationary. What invisible force was propelling Clooney away? I don't mind a few difficult to believe things, like the fire-extinguisher scene, but this is over the line, and it's not worth it for the sake of drama in a movie like this, IMO.

Pretty scary huh?¬† I'm pretty sure 95% of the people who says this movie isn't good probably just saw the trailer instead of WATCHING the whole thing. Don't judge a book by it's cover. This was the most heartfelt and emotional movie I've seen in a long time and it was totally worth paying for it. So if you think this movie isn't good watch the whole thing.

I liked the visual effects and give credit to the struggles of how just one person can pull against the odds for survival as long as she's determined. Human beings have the determination to survive. I think it focused on the emotions of what someone could go through as far as anxiety, hopelessness, despair, and determination to pull through, b focused, and be faithful in her religious right despite people's whiney fuss over their own religious views who'll respond to that alone. However, I'm already sick of this new Hollywood trend where they're leaving the endings up to the viewers imagination. This movie reminded me so much of Life of Pi. Beautiful capture of nature and a similar strugle. Ones with space and a debris field; the others with a Bengal tiger and a storm at sea. Either way, I see the struggle, but I hate these new aged films. Nevertheless, they're at least trying to do something different opposed to the same ole shoot em action movies that's grown boring.

Gravity, aka Hollywood's way of saying that I know more about the hazard of space, than a so called ""trained astronaut"". I practically predicted everything that these guys did horrifically wrong:
1) Matt (George Clooney) would have lived, if he weren't a cocky son of a bitch, that wanted to break that stupid ""longest space walk"" record, and if he didn't waste his fuel by flying laps around the space shuttle.¬†
2) When you hear that space debris is coming your way, you drop everything IMMEDIATELY!¬†
3) NASA could have predicted that there might be a debris chain reaction and would have called the mission off earlier. (also someone pointed out, that such a chain reaction is actually impossible)
4) I don't buy for a second that NASA couldn't establish ANY communication with the astronauts for the rest of the movie. A fucking Chinese bloke with a radio on Earth managed to contact Ryan (Sandra Bullock) in the Soyuz pod.
5) Ryan couldn't detach a harness that is made to be easy to handle. She stayed there like 2 minutes before detaching.
6) Any astronaut knows that oxygen is in short supply in space, and won't fucking have a panic attack every 5 minutes. An astronaut is trained to control their breathing.
7) Continuing the oxygen issue, you don't talk non-stop in space. Talking uses up more air. Matt knew Ryan had her tank low, yet he insisted she talked back to him.
8) These damn astronauts can't grab hold of anything if their life depended on it. Literally. Also those damn tethers break too easily.
9) There is a possibility that Matt could have lived if they both pulled fast and hard on that stupid tether. He would have definitely lived if he wasn't a cocky bastard earlier (see 1.)
10) Ryan takes a nice space stroll through the ISS (knowing full well that she is in danger). While doing this she didn't notice (or pay attention to) the electrical fire that was just starting. Also the fire alarm didn't detect fire, it only detected a fucking inferno. Fire is the most dangerous thing in space because oxygen saturation is a lot higher. Also without gravity, it's harder to control and it spreads faster. The fire detectors should detect a light candle, not wait till an out of control fire.
11) Ryan spend too much time on the intercom, trying to reach Matt or NASA, when it was already establish that Houston hasn't paid their phone bill.
12) Ryan doesn't know to brace herself before attempting to use a fire extinguisher in space. (At least she learned the hard way, and will use it properly later on).
13) NASA couldn't patch the software of the Soyuz to be able to use other languages (besides Russian) if necessary. It's the International Space Station. The only escape pods available should use a more international language. (i.e. English)
14) Ryan isn't careful enough with her tools. She almost lost that screwdriver while detaching the parachute off the Soyuz.
15) Ryan might be mentally challenged. She started howling like a wolf, to a Chinese bloke, instead of trying to save her ass. Also she is clearly depressed with suicidal tendencies. She probably wouldn't have gotten an OK from NASA. (Also hallucinating. But that could be because of the lack of oxygen).
16) Earlier Ryan proved she could stabilize the Soyuz pod, but when the Chinese Shenzou spirals out of control she does nothing. Autopilots are good, but that pod probably would have burned on re-entry in real life.¬†
17) Ryan didn't try to respond to NASA before exiting the pod. Also she should have taken the uniform off before exiting the pod. Or she could have tried keeping her helmet on. No smoke to get in her suit, she could have just waited there for the rescue. (unless the pod caught fire. In that case she would have bailed out).

Then this film crashed and burned harder than the space station. Honestly, the CG and suspense was above average (I enjoyed it), but everything else was just brutal. The acting was mediocre at best; characters are all one-dimensional. The theme had much more potential. I cannot understand how people seriously think this movie is great.

Only the effects are good an Oscar for that I can understand, but the rest of the movie is just plain awful.

Btw if you are in a tight spot in space in your spacesuit, the first thing you learn in training is to breath slowly and fight the panic. People are selected on that, if you cant do that you will not be allowed in Space. Stupid breathing and screaming of Sandra is soooo wrong. And it really kills all the tension.

Part 1. Sandra Bullock tells Commando Joe:

""I got to go back to space."" says Bullock.¬†
""Why?!"" Says Joe.¬†
""For Clooney.""¬†
""Ghost Clooney?... I see.""¬†
""Also..Commander Joe...i have to go back to find myself.""¬†
""The fuck?"" says Joe confused.¬†

And that is where the second movie really begins. With Bullock entering the space ship alone and no crew. She goes up to space yelling and screaming.¬†

She thens see a letter in space so she gets out of her shuttle, attaches the tether, and reaches the letter. It reads:¬†

""You Bitch! You actually left me! How could you?! And No, i will smack your daughter in the face when i see her in heaven and tell her you sold her red shoes to illegal immigrants! Love Ghost Clooney. P.S. I was the one who killed your daughter on the playground. No harm no foul right? ... but it was definitely a foul. ""

Sandra face stood shock. She was so angry and she flew into the deep end of the space. No help. No food. She just gave up.¬†

Until an image of her daughter appeared within the stars. Bullock thought it was her dad Mufasa but no, she realized it was her daughter.¬†

""Im ok mommy. Im playing jump rope with my new friend."" says Bullock's daughter.¬†

""Is it Johnny from across the street?"" says Bullock with a tear. He was always a sweet kid.¬†

""No mommy. It is my new friend Ghost Clooney."" And the stars next to her daughter image rearranged into Ghost clooney.

""how you doing?"" Says ghost clooney with a smile.¬†

""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" says Bullock.¬†",2013-12-31T08:20:50.000Z,1

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"Compared with what usually passes for ""good"" cinema these days, let alone Sci-fi, this film is pretty damn good.

Having said that, it's also quite a strange mix of cliches, action spectacle, introspective drama and thriller elements.

The action is indeed spectacular. And I think if Kubrick could've seen just how impressive the exterior space scenes look in this film, he might not have bothered with 2001: A Space Odyssey. He might have given up!

The thriller elements are also very successful, in the way that there is really no antagonist in the film. Well, not unless you count space itself, of course.
And there's a lot of excitement to be had with those damn oxygen tanks that always want to deplete at the worst possible moments.

In fact, I think ""Oxygen"" might have been a better title for the film.
Especially since the story has very little to do with gravity, and the crew's survival is utterly dependent on that precious O2.

The dramatic part is where I thought the film felt a bit underwhelming.
And this is in large part due to, what I consider, the miscasting of Sandra Bullock in the lead.
No no, she's not bad in the part. But showing emotion is not her greatest strength, and emotion is ultimately what's supposed to drive this entire film.

We, as the audience, are supposed to root for her. We're supposed to feel her frustration and anger, and empathize with her sense of hopelessness.
And we're meant to share her progress and setbacks. In other words, we should be with her on her journey to safety and some sort of personal redemption.

Unfortunately, that didn't happen for me. I found Sandra Bullock to be a little too stiff, and as a result, I didn't really relate enough to her to be fully engaged with the outcome.

The way I see it, it could have been almost ANYONE in that space suit, since I had so little emotional investment with the character. No matter who would be trying to survive this ordeal, it would of course be exciting to watch, but without the emotional involvement, it doesn't feel like a great loss if the worst happens, and therefor, the film has (sort of) failed as a drama.

I also didn't like the blatantly obvious religious overtones in the film.
There are references everywhere. Even when we're in the Chinese space station, we're ""treated"" to a huge closeup of a Buddha statuette.

Not to mention the return of ""Angel George"" at one crucial point.
Or how Sandra, who's playing a doctor (a scientist), after admitting that she doesn't know how to pray because she never needed to, suddenly has a change of heart in the face of danger, and now ""talks to God"".

I don't know, perhaps it's the Atheist in me that finds this hard to deal with.

And the worst line of the film is: ""Half of North America just lost their Facebook"".

SO? Facebook sucks! The loss of it would be good news!

All in all, though, the film does avoid the worst of the usual space cliches.
And when it doesn't, at least it weaves them into the story in a credible way, so that they don't distract us from what's important, unlike so many other films of this genre.

And even though I've been bitching a bit about it, Gravity is by far the best Sci-fi film I've seen since Danny Boyle's Sunshine.
Actually, Gravity is a much better film, and unlike Sunshine, it doesn't fuck up the ending.

Worth watching, people!",2013-12-23T04:13:00.000Z,0

And just to make things clear: Gravity is by far the closest to describing Space as it is in 'real life' (out of all those SF Space movies) with minimal fiction parts (that were made to serve the plot). Here's an idea: why don't you people go and watch a fucking documentary about Space if you want to masturbate over some true Space facts and stop wasting everyone's time with your pointless arguing?

In this movie every single Russian inscription looked pretty much accurate and correct. I also liked a little Orthodox icon attached over to the porthole. That was a nice twist finding its way to my Russian soul. What I didn't like about the movie is that all the mess started out because of us Russians. WTF??!

2013-09-04T23:30:25.000Z,OiTiKOy59o4,Gravity - Official Main Trailer [2K HD],"Before I say anything else, I want to make it clear that Gravity is pretty unique, this is a singular and interesting movie
Don't worry, I'm not going to make spoilers. I'll just point out some aspects that are explained at the very beginning of the movie and some other that doesn't have much importance in the plot, so don't worry, you can keep reading safely.
¬†That said, I don't appreciate AT ALL how Russians are portrayed, they seem stupid and incompetent in the movie.
The idea of Russians disposing of satellites with missiles without having things under control is just absurd. I'm sick and tired of the obsolete Cold War drill of always blaming Russians for virtually anything, as if they were dumb, evil or something.
Russia has been one of the most competent, prepared, talented and successful countries regarding space exploration. Hell, they were the first to launch a satellite, a dog and a man to outer space. They have been admirable pioneers of space travel since 1957.
Now even American astronauts use the Russian Soyuz to get to the ISS, and they also learn Russian. If Russians were such fools, why the hell would Americans do this? It's easy, because Russians aren't fools, in fact they are pretty good at what they do.

A couple of other things:
1- When you grab a moving object (like a ship) in outer space, you end up moving exactly at the same speed, direction, rotation, etc. as the object itself.
It doesn't matter if you let go of it. As long as there's no pushing, pulling or acceleration, your movement and velocity will be exactly the same as that object's, you won't move away from it. If your ship is orbiting in space and you just let go of it, you'll keep your position relative to it for as long as neither of you accelerates. There's no moving away stuff, once you ""get caught"" by an object, you move exactly like it and your position relative to it is conserved. Pay atention to one particular scene with Clooney and you'll understand why I say this.¬†

2- Astronauts in the movie move too fast through space in relation to the rest of moving objects. It almost seems like they are actually on Earth's atmosphere sometimes, judging by the speed of their movement relative to the other things. In space there's no such thing as moving fast in relation to your ship when it's already orbiting and you just let go of it or push/pull yourself a bit...not unless one of you starts accelerating a lot. Maybe the ship can do this by burning its engines, but astronauts definitely can't get much acceleration using just their own muscles.

3-If you have an rcs system then you don't need to use the main engine in order to make the ship move. The ""Reaction Control System"" allows ships to maneuver in space, you can easily recognize it by its typical small thrusters that release white fumes every time they are activated. They don't provide much thrust, but they can make the ship move in pretty much any direction at low speeds.
¬†
4-If you don't know Chinese and you have no experience with the ship... Well, you'll understand when you see the movie.

I was going to say more, but I don't want to make spoilers, so I'll end here.

I would recommend that you make sure you see it in 3D at the Cinema (this coming from someone who hates 3D) as the 3-D in this film really does work and doesnt just have a 2D background with one part of the screen popping out at you. It immerses you fully into the film.¬†

Sure ive heard there are a few technical facts that are wrong and Cuaron admitted he knew about these but it was necessary for the sake of the medium of making a film. This isnt a NASA information video.

The film is not on the same level in terms of 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of depth, its a far more visceral film that needs to be experienced in the cinema.¬†
Id also say the first half of the film is excellent and the second half is solid but not as good.

There are still some metaphorical elements to the film revolving around sandra bullocks character and her reason for living or wanting to survive (I wont say any more as I will reveal spoilers.) Symbolism is included as well (fetal position and the end of the film etc)¬†",2013-12-05T20:13:51.000Z,0

""You have a character who's drifting into the void and is getting farther and farther away from human communication. It's a character that lives in her own bubble and is a victim of her own inertia. So it was a moment in which she has to come out of her own bubble and metaphorically shed her skin. She gets out of that suit and soon she's in her primordial state. The film deals with rebirth, and this is the first hint of that - the first moment that it's done visually in a more explicit way. This is a character who's been surrounded by death and, on the verge of it, finally finds peace and repose.""¬†",2013-11-25T16:53:38.000Z,2

NASA train them with the worst case scenarios all kind of failures, accidents and to recognize between good and lame desicions. Worst case scenario... yes, even death. Why? Because it's not a child's game being sent to space where there's a chance you can even die the first 5 minutes after the mission started.

the concepts in the movie were good. actors did wonderful jobs. there are only two actors that actually do anything in the movie though, and one of them dies midway.

to me the ending didn't suffice. the movie itself seemed too short to me, despite being 1.5 hours long. when the movie said sci-fi i naturally thought of aliens, people colonizing other planets, etc. all that really happened was a lady got back home after her ship collides with a satellite. :\",2013-10-20T05:37:38.000Z,0

I'm sure it attracts great attention among st young teens and people who have limited knowledge bound by the laws of physics.

But what the hell, gravity is a fraction weaker where they are compared to the surface and they travel away from the earth as well. In addition they lose orbital velocity after they lose contact with their space shuttle which is impossible unless they had a force to counter act; they didn't have that.

Half of movie is concentrated on Sandra Bullock's spining in space.

There are only 2-3 good scenes where you actualy think you got hit in eyes, so that's only + for movie and 3D.

I still can't belive that movie got such big rating on imdb, but if you are big fan of space and astronauts you will probably like it (effects, not story)...

Sandra Bullock is forgettable and hard to connect with in the movie. Clooney did his part and did it very, very, well for the entirety of his screentime. Sadly, Clooney is more of a side character and the movie spends all of it's time focusing on Sandra who I really didn't care at all for, despite her sob story, struggles, etc. etc. we see~

Not the worst hour-ish of my time but I probably wouldn't buy or rewatch Gravity.",2013-10-18T03:00:09.000Z,0

The setting takes place entirely in space...for the most part. I knew this going in and didn't think it was going to be as good as it was. It's something different that you haven't seen b4.

It's okay, I respect that, but you have to understand critics must have an open mind for other movies. That's why you see movies like these go 5/5 because they don't think like you do, they have a responsibility for the upper crowd and so on.

I may hate bad astronomy but I'm looking forward to experiencing Gravity all over again nonetheless. It sure was one hell of a ride!

If the object slows down, it immediately begins falling to Earth under the force of gravity.

Your explanation of this is fucking awful. Firstly, how can you say that there are no exciting moments? This entire trailer is exciting. Second, some of those moments with George Clooney were pretty damn funny, so don't say that there were no funny moments. Third, the space station doesn't ""burn"" for 20 minutes, that's the effects of atmospheric re-entry on space crafts.

If the satellite was in a lower orbit when it exploded, the faster moving debris could indeed reach the same orbit as the shuttle and the IIS, but then it would be at the same speed and therefore be stationary relative to the shuttle and the IIS in that orbit so the two would not collide.

Space is VERY big,

Two objects on the same orbital trajectory separated by 1 second are still half a mile away apart.

If a russian satellite explodes in orbit on the opposite side of the earth from the space shuttle in the same orbit, how does the shuttle collide with the debris?

For the two objects to be in the same orbit they must be traveling at the same speed so how does one catch up to the other so they collide?

They are moving at the same speed around the earth so are stationary relative to each other regardless of their speed relative to the earth.

When strapped to the arm they are in effect one body rotating around a single center of gravity, but the mass as a whole is moving through space in a straight line.  Once she releases the strap she will continue to travel in a straight line in the direction she was traveling at the moment the connection is broken.

Sandra Bullock was open for the role, so she was chosen.

True feminism is a fight for equality of chances. If it wasn't for feminism,women would never get the chance to vote etc.
Modern feminism has a tendency to breach into the realm of forced total equality, absolutely ignoring biological differences and I agree that's stupid.

However just because there are measurable differences doesn't mean there should be different legal rights. THAT's what true feminism is all about.

I totally understand your frustration about it. However, based on the fact this movie was mostly done by filming actors in lightboxes, the amount of ""bad videogame cut scene"" is remarkably low.
