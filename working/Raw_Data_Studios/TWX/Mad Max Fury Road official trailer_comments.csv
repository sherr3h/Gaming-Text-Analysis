A few interesting action scenes but world building sucks harder than a porn star. And when someone makes a film in an alternate world, world building is essential. And those OK action scenes were nothing so spectacular or breathtaking, just a bunch of scenes you'd expect from Michael Bay, lots of boom boom, that's it. How did the film get 97% critic and 81-85% viewer score, I have absolutely no idea. A mediocre stupid fun if you don't have better things to do, so hard 6 at best.


As for the actors, of 3 that you will notice in the film, Tom Hardy plays Tom Hardy in torn up clothes, Charlize Theron is bland and generic with only Nicholas Hoult delivering a somewhat interesting character. The rest are basically just extras.


If there is ANYTHING that you WANT to watch besides this, go watch it, skip this one. Return to it only if there is nothing else, you are bored and you want some very stupid fun action. Even if you want very stupid fun action NOW, go find some better ones for it, there are plenty. Leave this one at the bottom of the ""watchable"" barrel.",2019-09-13T04:35:43.000Z,1

Which is best shown with Immortan Joe. We are never told that his health is failing, we are never told he was a soldier before the fall, we are never told he is a vain egotist. All of that is shown in his introduction. His boil covered skin, the plexiglass armor designed to make him look physically fit, and the breathing apparatus all show us that his health is failing but he still seeks to appear strong and fit. And his power and greed is also shown in the movie. In a world where most have nothing he had two of everything. He possessed two chrome revolvers, and his vehicle the Gigahorse was made from two Cadillacs fused together. And unlike the rest of his fleet there's not a single spec of rust on his car. Only the people eater possessed cars as fine as the Gigahorse.",2019-07-17T19:12:01.000Z,1

The tattered costumes they wear, the welded junkyard vehicles they drive, the chrome paint on the teeth, the environment, the way they fight, and even how they use a live-person for a blood bag. No apparatus, just stick an IV tube from a donor into your own arm and boom; you get clean filtered blood, all while your own contaminated blood is transferred to the donor and filtered using their kidneys before transferred back to you (i think thats how it works anyways).

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"The film was a blunder, it really was not about Mad Max and the characters were weak within the context of their character roles. It was more about the Imperator Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron than the main character played by Tom Hardy. The original 1979 miller version was way better than this film, and Mad max's dead daughter haunting him throughout the film; was just creepy! I was surprised how Miller failed this film.Nevermind that in the original film Mad Max, was originally a police officer, fighting to maintain law and order in a nuclear apocalyptic Australia. Its storyline was weak, because it lacked story context, and lacked in introducing the characters into the film. It also lacked the vivational sensation of an action packed film, which was pretty with the CPG; which is the only thumbs up it will get from me. The only thing I hope is that when they come out with Mad Max wasteland; that Miller learned his lesson. I hope it is way better than fury road because if not it will be the death of Millers franchise. Mad Max Wasteland was set to be released in 2017. However, there was a law suite by Miller against Warner brothers that has delayed the films release date.",2018-01-27T14:44:09.000Z,0

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Why is Max always the only one who seems to have a strong connection to the old civilization? Like, he is the only one who remembers it clearly, he is the only one who seems to have a civilized demeanour and does NOT (paradoxically enough) seem mad at all. I mean, litterally everyone else seem to be inbred weirdos who've been handed down stories over generations regarding the old world. Its always like Max is from a completely different era and really doesnt fit into that whole setting, he is way too old worldish. Some people claim that its because Max is old and that its a generational issue... but look at him! Old? Hell, there are older characters in the movies who act just as bonkers as everyone else.

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Not only one of the best action flicks ever made, one of the BEST movies ever made all-around. Absolutely stunning with no flaws, IMO. Each and every character has a fully-realized story arc - not just Nux and Furiosa, but Max as well. To all critics saying the titular character was underdeveloped... just remember, he was the reluctant hero trying to survive when he realized by the end that he couldn't just walk away from a noble cause again. Not until his mission was complete. He began the film as a 'feral' reduced to being someone's blood bag... and ended it by rediscovering a part of himself lost along with the rest of the world he knew: a sense of empathy for others, a basic quality of humanity. If that isn't character development, please explain why!

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Sorry but comparing this to the 3 previous Mad Max movies, this was a real let down in so many levels. Max in the last 3 movies was a road warrior,  in MAD MAX he took out the bikers for killing his wife and child as sweet revenge introducing the V8 Interceptor, MAD MAX 2 the road warrior in search for fuel helps a community relocate from scavengers. MAD MAX beyond thunderdome, takes max into a city of violence, outcast from Aunty finds a lost tribe who he helps find the old world. This Fury Road comes down to a bunch of woman saving his ass from being killed, the main woman seems to have more balls than Max. The character choice to play Max was all wrong, and failed to deliver on Max true story. It was a movie based on one big chase, with clean looking cars instead of rusty old welded machines. I'm sorry but this is my opinion and as a collector of Mad Max memorabilia, knowing the movies word for word and a movie buff of the 3 trilogy films, and watching these films since 1980 this Fury Road was all wrong.",2016-12-10T07:34:30.000Z,3

I'm not complaining though, he hasn't lost his touch, this movie was beautiful in every way but my parents thought it was 'too violent' and 'didn't have depth'?

       I  just finished watching Mad Max Fury Road and I will admit that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie  it was action packed and it was well worth the six Academy Awards that it earned. Its one of those movies that makes you think  about what you have to be thankful for what we're grateful for ordinary things like hope, friendship and water the simple things in life the things that money can not buy. And that's how D-Man 2012 sees it please feel free to leave your constructive criticisms in the comments section below and have a good night and God bless all of God's children.",2019-05-27T10:28:21.000Z,0

But the 3rd time he says,""witness me"", and flips the car over to save the girls,broke my heart and made my eyes tear up!...Also,when they snatched Zoe Kravitz's character(forgot her name)from the car and you see her kicking and screaming and Furiousa screams ""NOOOO!"",  Uggh my heart sank just like when Splendid died so tragically and unexpectedly...I  felt HORRIBLE when Furiosa, after traveling so far, realized she had gone the OPPOSITE direction! Man, the look on her face just said it all. I really felt her desperation...And last one lol, in the beginning when Max is caged up in the front of the car, I just kept saying, ""Omg that SUCKS so bad!!!!"" lol I would've died if that was me!..

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Great action sequences, but pretty mindless and nonsensical. First of all, this is supposed to be the apocalyptic future where water and gas are scarce. You would think that there would be a lot less driving if gas was scarce. But in this movie, people are driving endlessly, wasting lots and lots of gas. 

This is like a future fueled by drug hallucinations and physical survival skills. This is where the movie excels.

When I saw those beautiful girls with Charlize Theron, I cringed. They look like fashion models. This movie is like a GQ photoshoot on steroids. Gorgeous to look at and fun to watch and rewatch. But I still think Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior) is the best.

Tom Hardy is hardly in the movie. This is basically a Charlize Theron movie.",2016-01-16T18:14:24.000Z,2

There's no real back story or depth to immortan joe or the citadel, it seemed like an interesting place, water, food, civilisation, crazy tyrant government. Also Furiosa, no back story? The only female ""warboy"", I had to look on a wiki page for some answers, seems the spend all the budget on cgi action and couldn't be bothered to explain anything. 

Also a lead role who hardly speaks and when he does can't even pull off an Australian accent, what's that about?

It's so rare that a sequel doesn't suck... this did total justice... it was like 15 years in the making.    I read that it was going to be filmed on location in Australia but there was rain which caused a lot of flowers to grow and would have ruined the post-apocalyptic vibe, so they moved it to the Namibian Desert which is AMAZING, that red dirt like being on Mars...... final word, hats of to the stunt team, the stunts and mutant vehicles are absolutely incredible.     
Also even though it's obviously an action movie there were some interesting subtleties of concept woven in.... both male and female heroes who are both badass, the fact that she has lost an arm is an amazing touch of humanity, also the antipatriarchal sentiment, even a hint of Stockholm syndrome.",2015-12-11T16:11:04.000Z,0

I mean, look at Charlize Theron's face at 0:48. She doesn't need to say: ""You took everything from me and turned me into the right hand of a tyrant. Now I'll take whats most precious to you, and if it's the last thing I'll ever do."" One shot of her face is enough to say all of that. Or take that blone girl at 1:03 leaning out of the car. In every other movie she'd have said something like: ""If you want me back, you'll have to kill me. Me and your son, because I'll not be a slave anymore, and my son will not be a warlord."". All It took was one second of her face. Even though this movie is kind of short on plot, this way of telling the story is genius.",2015-11-07T14:25:52.000Z,8

Who killed the Bullet Farmer and saved them all from being annihilated in the night, single-handedly? Max.
Who killed the People Eater and blew up his limousine? Max.
Who fought and beat down Rictus? Max.
Who was it that single-handedly overpowered Furiosa, while she was being supported by the Wives and he was chained up to 250 pounds of weight? Max.
Who saved Furiosa when she was bleeding outAND collapsing her lungs, with little to no help? Max.
Who's idea was it to go back to the Citadel? Max.
Who took care of the Ploughboys? Max.
Who placed down the mines, that would end up stopping Joe's armada entirely, when they were stuck in the quagmire? Max.

Saw it online from Cineplex and it was FUCKING AWESOME. Honestly anyone who makes bad movies from now on I'm sending them to this movie. The first 30-40 minutes were absolutely perfect, completely utterly and obviously flawless. They fleshed out so much character, backstory and outlined the stakes of the movie beautifully. I understood the characters, had invested interest in seeing the story through and had a fuck ton of laughs. I swear every single minute of that first 40 was carefully planned out and made the movie a treat to enjoy.",2015-10-08T13:25:30.000Z,0

The only detailed place was the Citadel, other than that, there is literally no details to this world minus the one tree and that metal tower near the end.

The only variety this movie offered was the sandstorm and mountains, and even then, where were the ruined cities, the nuclear waste zones, the remnants of society should be scattered everywhere. Why is it all desert? Fallout 1 on PC had more details than this and that game was made in the 90s!!! No, forget that, I've played MUDDs with more detail than this, and those are mostly text based games with pictures sometimes!!!

All men in this movie (not including the ones who were working with the few females) were either dumb or weak/suicidal. Whenever a woman dies they made it to be very sad and upsetting. The movie focused on Feriosa way more than Max and even the main vilains were weak when it comes to a fair combat (Feriosa killed Immortal Joe seriously injured).

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I can't believe the number of people who have the audacity to be so inattentive and ignorant when complaining about this movie. It's inexcusable, and it's turning a lot of people off from this masterpiece, so I'm going to deconstruct all of their incorrect arguments for those who haven't seen:

""There's no story and dialog/terrible story.""
Sure, there's very little dialog and exposition, but that does not mean there is no story. Mad Max: Fury Road excels in visual storytelling, a unique and interesting form of storytelling which very few big budget Hollywood titles use. If you think there is no story, you simply aren't paying attention to the movie. While the overall story is fairly basic and predictable, the amount of depth put into the situations and the way they are woven together, as well as small details throughout the movie and references to Miller's other work, is so masterfully done that it overshadows all of this. Besides, a movie does not NEED to be complex to be good. I've seen the movie 3 times now and each time I notice a new detail I had never noticed before.

""It's all just one long action segment/car chase.""
... And? Isn't that what you pay for when you go to an action film? Isn't that why the name of the genre is ""ACTION""? Take a look at the latest Fantastic Four, it did the exact opposite of Mad Max in terms of plot, backstory, narrative and build-up vs. pure, raw, exciting, intense action, and look at the difference in response between them. It's also masterfully directed, using a tracking technique where the action is always being followed precisely between shots. This was covered in the Mad Max Film Theory Video if you're interested in this technique, as it really makes the film much better than all the shitty action segments Michael Bay puts out.

""It's feminist propaganda.""
This is false. The want to free from oppression and sexual slavery from a brutal, oppressive dictator, as well as the idea of women being diverse, in terms of beauty, skills and character, and capable of being on the same level as men, is not exclusive to feminism. Really, it's an idea that all human beings who aren't scumbags should embrace.

""The film is full of CGI.""/""The film is boring.""/""(Other Strange Generic Argument from someone with Insanity or a Meth Pipe).""
What are you talking about? Did you even watch the same movie? Did you too, like the people who say it has no story, just not even look at the screen for more than 5 seconds before declaring you were bored? Did you forget to take your ADHD meds today?

Alright, rant over. Seriously, this movie is one of the best action movies of all time. There's a reason it's being praised by everyone who has any sort of sense of what makes a movie good. it's incredibly entertaining and brilliant, unique yet familiar, and you need to watch it considering those points above.",2015-09-24T19:31:16.000Z,1

Well though I have nothing against that scene that is where I would draw a line on the ground to divide the good from the not so good. Even though I think the robot arm was a bit too sci-fi for Mad Max and the guy with the guitar was a bit cheesy I was still over 90% positive about the film until that point. But once it gets passed that driving off scene which I have described there then really does seem to be a sudden decline in quality. The dialogue wasn't very interesting and the action seemed to be an extremely watered down version of what occurred in the first quarter of the film. So I'm not complaining that they were recycling material.

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"The action is bad ass, but there are few issues with the character build up  ...  Building character sympathy toward mad max fell from the beginning when he first  left them behind and tried to run on his own.  since then I personally  hated madmax till the end of the movie ,,  unlike the old mill Gibson character.
2nd point is for the bad leader with the mask, as much as we and  the director  try to paint an ugly picture to hate this evil dude, if you look at it, he was only  chasing after his child (property). and notice he was trying to save the girl who mad max shot in the leg in the first place which cased her to fell and die. Another point is why were the girls running , i mean they could deliver the child and then run, they had luxury life, but notice they wanted hope (similar to the obama hope), meaning when we imagine hope universally ,  notice they broke free from the underwear with spikes... in other words this evil lord had brides that he didn't want them to sleep with other men, then placed a spiked underwear that they broke free from that was part of their hope. This is exactly the mindset of the U.S. forging policy. when they invaded Iraq mr Bush was worried about women in Iraq that couldn't vote :( so sad !!!
Going back to the point , the film generated a negative sense of sympathy toward mad max, and although the evil lord looked as ugly as he did, at least some empathy was built toward he movie since he wanted to save his child and get him back... this was not intentional .. just my thoughts .",2015-09-09T15:29:28.000Z,0

Give her a big d*** a set of balls and be done with it, that's what she seem to be missing.

The visual effects were perfect and Charliz Theron played beautifully; but you need more than that to make a good movie; The most important one is the PLOT. What was the plot!? chasing and chasing and chasing?! and who was Max?! this movie was not about max, more like about Furiosa! U could easily remove Max and nothing would happen! And Max wasn't mad at all! He was totally like everybody else! althogh in the begining he stated that. Nux could be considered mad. The characters seriously lacked the development.

It's just one long ass car chase through the desert and  then they decide to turn around and go back. The bad guys kinda reminded me of the smokers in water would who were cool but these guys were just retarded. A guy playing guitar on a truck thoughout the film? That's just lame. 

I respect your opinion even though I don't understand it. I just can't wrap my head around why people would call this a great movie. Action, action, action and nothing else. don't get me wrong, I like action but the story is what matters the most :)

Yeah, i get that the point is that they are trying to find the ""Green place"", but they are chasing with that evil, ugly man for almost the whole length of the movie, and then at the end, they decide to come back to the place they were running from the whole time. And Max character is pointless, i thought that in the end he will find his peace with the rest who are now ruling the Citadel town, but he disappears...

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"My list for best movies of 2015 so far...
1. Mad Max: Fury Road- best Mad Max movie I've ever seen...well that's because I haven't seen the other movies. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are badass in this movie. If this movie wins any award, I will be shouting ""OH WHAT A DAY! WHAT A LOVELY DAY!!!""
2. Jurassic World- now that's a worthy sequel. You really can't compare it to the original series, because it basically ignores the other sequels. Even if it can't beat the original, it was fun and awesome. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great. Awesome ending btw.
3. Inside Out- such an original and heartfelt movie that should be watched by plenty. It has superb animation (as always from Pixar), likable characters (Bing Bong is my favorite), and it has such creative writing. Thank you Pixar for not being disappointing like your Cars movies. Pixar is back on track.
4. Avengers: Age of Ultron- I thought it was good, but I still think Guardians of the Galaxy is the best MCU movie (MY OPINION!!!). Ultron was a cool villain, and I love the addition to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. If there's one problem, I wish it was darker and less repetitive. Still good none the less.

But now words cannot describe how dissapointed I am. This actually might be THE movie, the movie that makes me stop watching movies. Atleast for a while, I need to catch some breath. It is so stupid and superficial, I don't even know how to explain, thats how dumb it is. If I wanted to see stunts I'd go to a stunt show, I watch a movie to be entertained or touched, not bored. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. The visuals easily make this movie a 7 or 8, but I have to retract points because the story line is very bad. I can't believe how bad the story is in this movie and solely relies on visuals, there were plenty of moments I was grossed out by all the cheesiness. Thanks for ruining mad max, but atleast mass hype works and hollywood earned lots of money.",2015-06-24T23:30:53.000Z,1

This is just more expensive festival like MM3. Miller completly did not undrstand what brings him fame in his Mad Max 1 and 2. His work was just addcidentaly greate. 1 becouase of times of their relise, and greate role oF Mel Gibson, Hugh Keays-Byrne,Vernon Wells,Emil Minty, and other not famous faces at this time wich gives realism to this movies. Ofcours the legendary epic car¬† wich became Icon of the series.¬† Vilans in MM1 MM2 weare so damn creasy you could not predict what they do, they weare so scary watcher was worried about main character. Peoples became worried in MM1 For main character and his family, in MM2 woried aboud Max, his car and his dog. Fury road main vilan¬† just do not egzist, and more he is spread for 4 characters wich are flat as table top and so rare on the screen you forget about them. The good main character Max............do not egzist either. Tom Hardy as¬† Max is not bad but is not greate to. Whole show is stolen by FURIOSA Charlise Therone about wich incident i was worried since i get know about her¬† angage in the movie.

¬† I give you¬† primitive and simple pictures what G.Miller done with his movies.¬† MM1 was like tenage first love, strange time with head filled with feromons, and fealing like live in another world......and ofc the first virgin sex. MM2 was like¬† greate¬† one week fuck, action from start to the end holding peoples in greate pleasure and adrenaline. MM3 was like watichng porn star on the¬† small screan wanking to it double time.¬† MM4 Furiosa Road is like going to cheap burdel. To put dick inside cum on the face and walk out peing for it. No soul, no real pleashure, no fealings. Just nothing. Just poore loosing preashure but turning valve.¬† This is my opinion. If you do not agree you have prove precysly what i said wrong about G.Miller movies. Other way just go to the burdel and take pleashure leaving my opinion aleone. thanx",2015-06-05T11:52:00.000Z,1

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, although Charlize Theron was pretty good in it. Hell, it was pretty much her movie with Tom Hardy as a supporting cast member. The car chases were fun as always but we've seen it all before in the previous Mad Max movies. OK, the porcupine cars were unique to the series but that
s about it. I was half expecting to see a helicopter of some kind join the chase, it was that generic.

Other reasons why was it so bad?

1. Ultra lame plot. What did it take Miller to come up with that? 5 seconds?¬†

2. Tom Hardy is NOT Mad Max. Not even close. Not even for a single second did I think of him as Max. He did remind me a bit of of Harrison Ford in ""Force 10 From Navarone"". And if they ever did a movie about Han Solo's early years, he might be good in that role.

3. Lots of dumb\sloppy stuff. For example, the pass is blocked by a massive landslide and then, as if by magic, all of the rocks are removed on the return trip. Or the guy with the spot light randomly shooting in the dark despite having no clue how far ahead they were. Or hooking the trucks winch up to the dead tree and Max helps hold the tree up!!! Or Theron helping push the rig when it was stuck in the mud! HAHAHAHAAHHAAHHA!!!¬†

The main good thing about the movie is Miller wisely staying away from too much CGI effects.Other than that, there's not much left to praise. Gibson was truly wise to stay clear of this stinker of a movie.",2015-06-03T19:06:36.000Z,0

This movie looks like a ""fun"" (safe) ride.

... Nevertheless, this does not have the same gut-wrenching

a¬†woman carrying the broken body of a child in his arms....

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I'm not usually one for dystopian films but everything in the trailers was so amazing I had to go and see if with my boyfriend. Both of us loved it from beginning to end. Over 80% of the movie is real action and not CGI (which was mostly removed to erase wires, for Charlize's arm, etc.) so there were guys on moving vehicles at high speed doing acrobatics and shit for real which is terrifying and amazing!

Some people complained about how Max didn't appear to be the central character despite being titular. Max has always been more of a narrative voice. He's the guy who walks into someone else's story and has a part to play in it, but it's never all about him. He's our eyes and ears in this other world.

~SPOILER WARNING~

And this was about so much more than 'The Wives'. It was about a war lord suppressing the people he was meant to be in charge of. Preventing them from getting the basic natural requirements to life like food and water. Keeping the plant life high above their reach and living above them as if he was somehow closer to the Gods. Promising them salvation and a place in Valhalla for serving him, which are things no man has control over. Exploiting their desperation for a better world to incite their loyalty.

So if you want to see the best action film of this year, with real character development (Nux, Furiosa, The Wives, Max) as their co-dependency evolves from a need to survive to genuine compassion for one another's well-being, exceptional stunts, villains who are oddly reminiscent of today's politicians in parts, and people who stand as equals regardless of their appearance, health, gender, and capabilities, then you HAVE to watch this movie.",2015-05-31T17:55:00.000Z,0

It has great costume and set design but pretty much nothing for story or plot. No character development. It is just a sequence of events that are 95% a car chase with Max playing a role equally as minor as the one white skinned ""war boy"" that tags along with the main team. Perhaps less of a role.¬†

Utter garbage plot, dialogue, casting and script. Seems to have been directed by a lesbian feminazi high on crack. I guess some people, you really can fool all the time. Tom Hardy, proud bisexual and admitted cuckold, spends the first 30 minutes emoting chained to the front of a truck. I am sure it would have been possible to make this film more ridiculous except I can't think of how.

You will understand the story, you just won't understand where Max has come from and his background.

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I've seen it. 10/10 all around. Hardy is spot on as Max. Charlize is a bad ass. Max does thrash her ass in the movie so there is none of that over the top feminism you might be worried about. The action is insane and constant. It's pure chaos and anarchy that has a twisted logic behind it. At one point a guy on bungee cords is jamming out on a electrict guitar on top of giant war rig while motor cycles are jumping trucks and a giant fireball engulfs 10 cars.

The only complaint I have with it is there is virtually no rest for the constant anarchy and chaos. Little talking. But I have gotten used to that nonsense and I remember this is Mad FUCKING Max. All the previous films have had little talking and so with this one. Go see it. Best movie of the year so far.",2015-05-28T18:29:28.000Z,0

And two when the bikers bkow up the rocky underpass only immortan joe can get through and he leaves the rest of the warboys to move the rubble and follow when its clear. Then later on mad max and crew drive through the rocky arch again completley rebuilt. Dont tell me the war boys cleared the rubble and decided to rebuild it in the same arch/ underpass shape.

The deshumanity of Max in the beginning, just trying to survive, and slowly changing, calming down his mind and working together for surviving. A hero that is not all by himself (much more realistic)... I liked even more. The best movie of the franchise. Hopes to be recognized.

I guess there just isn't enough CGI in this movie to keep our short attentive generation happy. But eh, f*ck em. I personally hate dropping $40 at a movie and this movie alone made me have faith that action movies aren't dead. I didn't watch any trailers, didn't even know it was out until my friend invited me. I saw it that night and the next day. The characters, story, editing direction and live stunts were astonishing. There's only about 10% of CGI is this movie and that's why I believe I enjoyed it. Then again I grew up on movies that don't involve the same shitty lovey dubby action plots. To each their own on who likes it or not. But if you haven't seen it. The shut your ugly face because I've read your guys' ""angered opinion"" stating worthless garbage like ""stereotypical"" and ""racist"". But hey, opinions I guess, no matter how ridiculous and incorrect they are. This movie is a straight up day one buy for me personally.",2015-05-27T08:37:12.000Z,0

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"To be honest, i found that the hype created by the trailer of this movie was way too big, the movie didn't live up to it. Yes, there was alot of wonderfull action scenes, but there was also way too much time spent on the story. Plus, it was always the same thing all along, at the end, it was getting very repetitive. I went to watch the movie with my friends and we are all action movie addicts, and we all were kinda disapointed when the movie was over. The action in the movie is indeed unique, but the movie is way too long for it to be entertaining. In the end, we got bored and i find the movie didn't live up to what i expected, so definetily not the ""action movie of the century"" as some people name it. ",2015-05-25T22:26:14.000Z,0

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"There come times in movie history where a genre defining film is created, something so magnificent and grand that it forever affects the films of the future. Mad Max: Fury Road is a film that your grandchildren will ask if you saw it in theaters, and those of us who did will be proud to tell our children ""yes.""
The movie begins with picking the audience up and placing them in the universe of Mad Max: where packs of roving guzzoline seeking bandits and psychopaths dwell, killing all who oppose them, and where two headed, irradiated lizards are eaten raw without a second thought. The sheer deadness of the world is gorgeous, and the fact that they use very little CGI brings it home. When the audience sees the stunts, cars flipping, exploding, stuntmen being thrown from them as they careen into canyon walls, they see real people and vehicles. Too often has a overly digital set and stunts made an action movie a sterile pool of disgusting brackish water, and bland characters who are either immortal or unlikable only add to it. Yet, Mad Max is the opposite: Max and Furiosa are very mortal, and their peril is real. Max is strapped to the front of a car and driven around the desert while being used as a blood bag, and Furiosa comes quite near death on several occasions. The enemies are made human by the addition of Nux, a War Boy who joins the protagonists, and only serves the Big Bad due to a religious devotion instilled in him by brainwashing. The Five Wives are very human, and compelling, given varied personalities. The movie, despite being an action packed thrill ride, makes time for subtle character development along the way.
And this movie is truly a nonstop action scene. Perhaps fifteen minutes of its almost two hour stretch were slow, and its constant adrenaline rush makes one near mad. Every single bit of it is George Miller's genius, and it is truly unusual in the times of shallow plots and characters in action, where stunts are fake and blows softened by the cutting of a camera.

 I wanned some things tough. 

 More gore when the villan died , i mean no gore all the movie , but the villain deserved to die brutally , and the lack of gore for the rest of the movie would have made a nice impact .

I was so glad every time someone died because it was an indication that the movie was closer to the end. I enjoyed the commercials before the movie far more than the movie itself. I could not wait to come home and beg youtubers NOT to ever waste their time or money on this film.

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"The reason why I hope this movie dose well it would force companies to balance between practical effects and props and CGI and they could make vast amounts of money. And this movie felt even more balanced with male and female heroes. A few younger folk say the movie lacked dialog but idk this type of movie was always focused more on action. To me this feels like a more mature version of Mad Max but that may just be me. I compare the Movie The Empire Strikes Back-though at the time not as much CGI was possible, but I use that movie to judge on the full balance of humor, set pieces ect. That movie, just like Fury Road has the right feel it needs.What I mean is its fantasy but it dosen't feel cartoony. I think adults will be pleased. It's been a long time since we seen anything like this before. I hope classic horror will make a return as well. Horror as art not torture porn.",2015-05-24T17:24:44.000Z,1

The human race is fucked up and one day we will make WW3 and that would be it. I'm not talking about the movie, i'm talking about ignorant people who claim new Mad Max to be a masterpiece.¬†

Tom Hardy aka Mad Max doesn't have dialogues like at ALL. He sounds retarded and it feels like he is struggling pronouncing those wise words. This movie isn't about Max it's about Charlize Teron, big truck and a bunch of explosions. Main characters aren't deep or charismatic. Furiosa, Max and a bunch of Victoria's Secret models look dull and cliched, except for Nux, he playerd much better.¬†

Delivered all the machinery and the inner working guts of mechanical post apocalyptic muscle you could want without any terrible CGI overkills ruining it. So gritty and legit, distilled everything you loved about the original mad max's and amped it up with a beefier budget while not selling out. Its weird, unlike any other movies out there, and its more car chase scene that anything, but enough plot to give over 2h of absoltuely incredible vehicular mayhem chase scenes justice. Also a welcome healthy serving of gore, not toned down for the masses. Those who liked the originals for what they were will not be disappointed.",2015-05-22T23:01:27.000Z,0

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"*watched this movie last night, here's what i thought of it*
came from the movies last night, stunned by how great this movie actually was, no story going on whatsoever which was my reason to go watch this movie, which i was of course disappointed, yet the visuals, intense, consistent action was... repetitive, doesn't mean they weren't good, they were to be honest, great, intense and worthwhile.
Visuals? 10/10 without a doubt, they were amazing, specially in 3D, the fast paced car action in 3D were amazing, a movie like this should be experienced in theaters.
Action? 9/10, repetitive at some points, but as i said, worthwhile
Story? i can't rate it, considering there wasn't any story actually going on, the point of watching this movie is the visuals and action scenes.
its about immortan joe, wanting to get back his female property/ or what ever they were considered to him, they escaped with furiosa and the action begins from here.

Should you watch this movie?¬†
A- if you're into action movies, then this is perfect for you, definitely a badass movie, with many memorable scenes
B-if you're into story, then you'll be disappointed

I'm kind of bummed actually having seen it. I was all juiced up after reading the reviews and I thought I was in for something truly unbelievable.

If you're expecting intricate story telling and vast references that link up previous Mad Max movies then you'll be sorely disappointed. Dont go into this film with that mindset. Mad Max was made famous for its action packed sequences with amazing stunts. This movie is exactly that, but for almost the entire film. It delivered on all fronts as far as action goes. Think of it as another epic story in the life of Max. I mean do you go around telling strangers about your past?! No you dont, and thats why I seriously put this down as one of the action greats, jumps straight into the chaos and barbarism of the Mad Max universe.

Charlize Therone (sp?) is the star of this movie. The whole movie is all about her and her story of rescuing oppressed women. It's not about Max at all. He's a side character. WTF Georgde Miller?! - We, the faithful fans, wait 30 years for you to try to get this turkey to fly and you give us THIS??? -- DO NOT go to the theater to watch this mess. ALSO, the character development is so non-existent that you end up not identifying with or caring about these characters at all. VERY POORLY written, and the movie has some kind of weird feminist agenda that was passe after the 90s. -- I think they really have been trying to get this thing into production since the 90s so it makes sense, but they should have updated and fixed it. The world has moved on, your gender wars are out of fashion. -- SAVE YOUR MONEY.

there is no business for this feminist message to be in this premise from this movie.
It would never occur to these characters that they are treated like ""things"". all they would know, is that they are treated badly. if such were the case. and they would just try to escape anyway. cause the ""we are not things"" message is kind of mute and is kind of stupid, because what about men in this society, who are also treated like ""things""? because they are only used for specific reasons.

I personally don't think it's that good and wouldn't know what movie to say is but, I recommend seeing it. It's just not the greatest movie ever, 2 reasons. 1, it felt kind of random and the story and characters felt kind of limp. 2, it's titled Mad Max: fury road but it feels like it should have been titled just Fury road and that's because the story is more about the female characters, not anything wrong with that but.. It almost felt like Mad Max was tacked on. Either way it's a good movie and you should see it, but it's definitely not the best movie of the decade and I don't even consider it the best movie of the year, but that's my opinion.",2015-05-19T17:19:29.000Z,0

I love the marvel universe just as much as the next guy, but strictly from a cinematographic standpoint, Mad Max was far superior. Joss wheaten is a capable writer, but he is nowhere near a great visual storyteller. His shots are rather bland and not cinematically motivated. They may look ""cool"" because of all of the flashy cgi, but if you take them for what they are, they are nothing special. George Miller on the other hand utilized a lot of interesting film techniques in the movie. His manipulation of frame rate in the edit allowed for a unique rhythm in pacing. His use of a centered framing style helped keep the audience oriented and concentrated on the action. His use of color helped to differentiate the universe from a sea of bland desaturated post-apocalyptic wastelands in films. Miller showed a solid understanding of the craft of filmmaking and I think that is commendable. He was also able to create very entertaining and dynamic character arcs that showed lots of development (Furiosa finding out about her home, Nux's change of heart, Max's eventual willingness to help) without shoving the emotional moments down the audiences throat. He let these characters be defined by their actions, as they should be. I enjoy both films but Mad Max was a ¬†quantifiably more artistic and cinematic.

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"""Feminism""aka ""Femi-Nazism"" ruined this movie. Honestly, if the movie was just called Fury Road, it would have been fine and dandy, but I went to see a movie about Mad Max, not Furiosa.

As a feminist, I honestly am tired of women that feel like they need to get a movie catering to them--hints the Femi-Nazis' staple of the female hero. Female heroes are cool, but not when it's obvious that Femi-Nazis' are the ones being catered to. It's sad that it's gotten to this point. The director definitely shouldn't have went to a Femi-Nazi to write the part for Furiosa.

No one likes when ppl portray women as whiners, yet Femi-Nazis are behind this.....

This movie was fucking awsome!
The action in this movie(witch is almost the whole movie) is just amazing!
I love that most of it is practical effects and not CGI(yes Michael Bay,practical).
This movie has made me want to check out the other two Mad Max movies(ive heard the third one is crap,so will not be watching that).

In the 2 hour runtime, there is easily an hour and thirty minutes of action scenes. And George Miller did a spectacular job not making this movie feel cluttered. 
Tom Hardy was amazing. Charlize Theron was a complete badass. Nicholas Holt is incredible. I can not think of ONE flaw in this movie. Terrific screenplay, the stunts were something I had never seen before. And as a huge fan of the previous Mad Max films (excluding the third), I can say that if you are considering going to see this movie, make sure you are ready for what this movie will do to you. In the most beautiful way possible. ",2015-05-18T01:29:29.000Z,1

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Just saw it here it is my review: If you are a fan of the saga go see it now, if you are not...go see it anyways! George Miller the original director returns as the father of post-apocalyptic cinema. The textures and the colours of the movie maintain the atmosphere of the old ones. The action is smart and fast. You will be on the edge of your seat all the time. The designs of the cars are original as fuck. The concept artists and the VFX artists did a great job, an amazing one. The writting is very good. You wouldnt expect such an original screenplay and dialogue from a blockbuster but thats thanks to George Miller and his writters team. The stunts are amazing they did a hell of a job with the camera movements. The characters have each one their own arch. The acting is specific to this kind of world. The world created feels like poetry. Cinematography is punk as hell. Conclusion: 5 stars. A beautiful ride.",2015-05-14T23:31:16.000Z,0

just saw some interviews with george miller and some of his actors, they were spouting the pay gap and all kinds of bullshit, oh how lovely. fuck this movie.

the only reason they have action in it was for the guys, but really, the story is for women. that's how they are selling it. So unless you wanna be preached to about feminism from debunked wage gap spouting morons, be my guest.

If you don't know already, this movie was made to be a big fuck you to men. That's very cute.

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Reasons for fans to be excited.

Been a fan of the series for 30 years since i saw the first 2 on video and part 3 in theaters at age 4.¬†

Here are some reasons:¬†

The first 2 were r-rated adult oriented gritty sci-fi action picks with style and class, part 3 was a PG-13 family film, fun with nice performance by Tina Turner if a bit watered down compared to the first 2 even it's not as bad as AVP or Robocop 3 or mediocre as Terminator Salvation.¬†

I'm glad George Miller is back as director and they got a nice writer for this, although Mel will be missed but Hardy should be a nice replacement. I'm also glad it's back to the R-rated formula as we already had one PG-13 MM movie and that was 30 years ago as it was enough, i mean nice to see them go back to the adult oriented gritty formula of the first 2 classics. I mean we had R-rated hits recently like Kingsman, Equalizer and American Sniper proving there is an audience for these kinds of action films. Hell even Predators proved when it went back to the R-rated formula after the dismal AVP showed there can be love for an adult orienited r-rated series.¬†

Plus some old school practical effects with new stuff mixed in and all that.",2015-05-09T18:32:14.000Z,1

The only long chase scene was at the end of that movie. Also it doesn't really matter that Mel Gibson doesn't play MM in this movie. Just the whole style is typically present generation material. Which is pretty bad in most cases. Visuals/action over style. I'm going to watch it but I think it's going to be even worse than the beyond thunderdome movie...

From IMDB.com
""It is a reboot. At the April 30th, 2014 test screening in Burbank, CA. Director George Miller told attendees that the reason for a reboot was that too much time had passed between the last Mad Max film to do a sequel or a film set between, along with doing such would mean a plague of continuity issues and creativity restrictions. George also commented that he didn't want to do a ""remake"" as he had no intention on retelling a story already told. A reboot allowed him to bring the universe and wasteland 30 years up to date while keeping Max as the moviegoers remember him, a man with nothing to lose after the loss of his family"".

""From Warner Bros. press release: ""Mad Max: Fury Road Seminal director George Miller returns to the post-apocalyptic universe he created three decades ago with the cultural phenomenon Mad Max. Tom Hardy reinvents Max Rockatansky in Mad Max: Fury Road, Millers extraordinary new take on the legendary character for a new generation of fans.""

""The storyline borrows from the setup of the original trilogy, particularly from the second movie but in its own new universe. Set years after the new Max (Tom Hardy) lost his family during the early days of the societal collapse. Max is now a lone drifter in the post-apocalyptic wasteland as an empty shell of a man with very little left to lose"".",2015-05-04T21:36:14.000Z,0

This is way too good of an example of hollywood raping movies that they have stolen from other countries AKA the 90s godzilla film.¬†
i was really excited when i heard they were rebooting Mad max, one of the 1# movies of my child hood. Being an Australian myself, i always jump at the opportunity to see awesome movies made by Australians and seeing trailers for this movie has sickened me quite deeply, seeing a Australian franchise whos characters were identifiably Australian has now been ruined to catour to an American audience that the original movie probably wasent targeted at in the first place.
Its truly unfortunate that things like this happen in the film industry, i dont know what other reason there would be to have the characters be American other then to appeal more to an American audience, all i do know is that its going to lose some Australian fans over this.
I dont know why there hasent been any coverage about this on forums or on youtube and i think it should be addressed for the sake of die hard mad max fans that are bothered by this as much as I am right now.",2015-04-25T08:31:06.000Z,1

Most of the effects and stunts are practical, but CGI was needed for the more impossible elements.This time, Max teams up with a character called Furiosa, who's trying to get five young women, kept as breeding property by the warlord Immortan Joe, to safety. It's a simple plot, which suits the series fine. ""Fury Road"" isn't a reboot; think of it as just another Max Rockatansky adventure, only with Tom Hardy as the lead this time. Works for James Bond.

I guess they're unaware that George Miller has directed, written and produced 3 other Mad Max films in 1979, ¬†1981 and 1985. All of them basically defined the post apocalyptic genre in my eyes. Fallout, Borderlands and virtually any video game that has a barren wasteland tone was probably inspired by what Miller did with the first 3 Mad Max films and of course other great post apocalyptic films. Miller didn't create the post apocalyptic genre that's been going on since before the 50s but in my opinion he just perfected it. notice how I typed ""in my opinion"" just in case I get firebombed.",2015-04-16T20:52:52.000Z,1

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I view each of the Mad Max movies as a unique film. The character is the same, but the setting seems a bit different every time. For example, in the original, there's a sense that the organized society (albeit a failing one) still exists, with medical services, the police, fire department, etc, still somehow muddling through. In the intro to the Road Warrior, however, we learn in the intro sequence that the society has crumbed down due to wars over oil, and that the events in the original film were all part of that decay. A the movie progresses, however, we clearly see that the last vestiges of an organized society have all been wiped out. In Thunderdome, furthermore, for the first time there's a talk of radiation and nuclear armageddon and there's even a clearer sense of ""before"" and ""after"". Now, a franchise is rebooted, and from its trailers it looks like its' going to be a cross-over between Thunderdome and Road Warrior. However, I personally would prefer to see more of the original (1979) Mad Max world, with a semblance of a still-existing, albeit crumbling, organized society. Perhaps, the 2014 Australian movie Rover was more faithful to the original 1979 Mad Max film than the Fury Road, which obviously harks back at its sequels, will ever be.",2015-04-07T08:19:06.000Z,0

George Miller was amazingly capable of filming that car through the early Mad Max movies and Road Warrior. After Road Warrior, it was just Hollywood silliness with Tina Turner and Peter Pan lost boys. Ridiculous. Put the warrior on the road in his bad ass AMC javelin rat rod and let the games begin.

I don't think I will go to see this one. How do you fuck up the MadMax franchise?

WOW, the first trailer blew my mind, easily the best trailer I have EVVERRRR seen and that's saying a lot. Absolutely can not wait for this.

2015-03-31T17:00:04.000Z,hEJnMQG9ev8,Mad Max: Fury Road - Official Main Trailer [HD],"My plot prediction by just watching both trailers: It's a simple plot. Max drives around all lonely, gets picked up by those thugs, escapes and takes the women with him followed by an insane car chase into happy end for him and most women.

But in all honesty, I don't really care about plot depth here. It looks amazing with superb action scenes and a lot of steampunk-over-the-top characters. Even though this movie will be beaten by the avengers and star wars income-wise, I got a feeling that this will actually be my favorite movie of the year.",2015-03-31T23:41:08.000Z,0
