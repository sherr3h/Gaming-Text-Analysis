2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,",,Carl Sagan once said
that human beings are like butterflies
who flutter for a day
and think it's forever. 
Time and distance 
are the heart's natural enemies. 
Everyone we meet... 
Everyone we love... 
How we got here... 
what path we choose... 
and who we choose to remember. 
They are all a part of our story. 
But we cannot allow the story
to be written for us. 
Because we don't have forever, 
sometimes all we have is a single day.""",2019-11-19T18:22:55.000Z,0

And it‚Äôs probably one of the more overlooked movies of this year. The 2 leads have amazing chemistry. And I do understand people being upset because he doesn‚Äôt have his ponytail ,red tie, pinkheadphones and I think the filmmakers wanted to make it more impactful how they met cause if they met in a record store like in the book it wouldn‚Äôt hit as hard as them meeting for the first time when he saved her life: and I get you wanna stay close to the source material . (Trust me I‚Äôm a comic book fan I want material as close to the source as possible) but that honestly doesn‚Äôt make the movie any better or worse. The movie in my opinion I liked it. But it won‚Äôt get better if he has a ‚Äúponytail or she has headphones that I‚Äôll see for a few mins because in the actual film ‚Äúspoiler alert‚Äù it‚Äôs not in the movie all that much and if you see in the trailer once he saves her life that‚Äôs the last time you see those headphones.",2019-09-16T08:30:58.000Z,1

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,"Black women are not beautiful. Half black women are beautiful. Only half black women can appeal to black men (who are born of black women and have black sisters, grandmothers, aunts, and female cousins) and men of other races. Fully black women cannot do this *sarcasm*. The Sun Is Also A Star is what happens when black people are not in control of their representations. Nicola Yoon, a fully black woman, created a fully black character in her book only to have her represented by a visibly half black woman in the movie. Being a percentage black does not make a person capable of representing black people, especially when you do not meet the African phenotype. Yara Shahidi is not the problem. The racists who chose to cast her are the problem. Take note of how biracial people are never chosen to represent white people. Yara Shahidi will never be casted to play the biological daughter of two white parents, with a white movie audience expected to accept the nonsensical offspring. Yet, audiences are often expected to accept biracial actors (especially girls/women) as the offspring of two black parents, despite the visually unrealistic representation. Closing note: Hollywood is and will always be racist trash that loves perpetuating the ""1 drop rule"" falsehood because it associates beauty and value with white/light skin. White controlled media is using the heavy feature of biracial and non-black women paired with black men to minimize the appeal of black women to black men, causing further division (equating to lack of unity which equals lack of empowerment) in the black community. It's the latest tactic you guys, wake up! Yara ridiculously looks like an adopted child amongst her fully black family in the movie. I do not see Yara as a black woman. I see her as a biracial woman who should play biracial characters. Black authors should only sign movie deals under strict requirements to have movie characters meet specific physical/visual/racial phenotype guidelines that align with their storybook characters.",2019-06-27T12:12:16.000Z,0

So i watched the movie! It was amazing! However a lot was changed! Mr. Martinez is supposed to be Jeremy Fitzgerald? And i guess it‚Äôs okay they didnt add the affair with his secretary. They can‚Äôt fit everything! But that ending! They changed the ending which i was looking forward to! Ik they look to young to be 27 ( well at least Yara) so i guess that‚Äôs why they did 5 years later and not 10 but at the coffee place and not on the plane with Irene? SPEAKING OF IRENE!

You don‚Äôt know what it may be like to find the perfect person for a role. I‚Äôm sure there were tons of full black girls that audition, but maybe they didn‚Äôt have what it takes. Obviously the actress can‚Äôt be straight white, but I choose to believe that characteristics and personality come before a minor skin issue.

Sometimes it seems that aliens have taken over all positions of power because of what is being palmed off as artistic creation. What happened to all of the creative writers and producers? All we have are 'special effects' and empty headed nonsense. 

The scene at the end is pathetic...after 5 years the immigration lawyer (who was working pro bono) shows up at the coffee shop to tell Miss Jamaica that he doesn't know the name of the Korean dude.  

The Korean romeo is working as a waiter at said coffee shop...of course she has one hour to spend with him before her flight so she can resume her doctorate in SF...all nonsense...a sloppy ending to a lousy film IMO.",2019-05-17T03:33:48.000Z,1

History has shown us that (eg Marlon Brando in Sayonara: a movie about inter racial love and marriage during a time when it was frowned upon). A movie about how a single person is hiding a family from ICE and racist residents and gangs at the border(Anne Frank-esque) is something worth while. Not this crap. This movie is set in New York, so where is the class. You can put these two mooks in LA and nothing would change. There is no struggle. She is being deported, so where is the struggle (genuine NY style of struggling) this is (Devil wears Prada, oh i didnt get to be in fashion boohoo struggle).",2019-05-15T19:41:41.000Z,0

Yara Shahidi looks phenotypically black, the only thing that stands out is her 3c hair which still looks similar to the hair of black women. Even my hair is 3c/4a and I have 2 black parents. Also handsome squidward, looks asian and not very biracial. Does he look like the everyday korean boy? No but a lot of the famous koreans dont even look like the everyday korean person. Both of these people look great and I think everyone should sit down and watch the movie. I have friends from jamaica and they aren't even dark skinned, they look like like Yara. Jamaicans aren't a monolith ,just like black americans aren't either. Dark skin black women need movie roles and accurate representation but honestly at least it wasn't someone like Zendaya or Amandla who obviously looks mixed.

Jesus has to punish sin because he is righteous and just but his grace is merciful and allows us more time to get right with him. Jesus could have punished us the first time that we had ever sinned but he has been merciful and patient with us but it won't be like that forever, one day we will stand in front of him, and we will have to answer for our sins, dont be that person just because you didn't want to believe in him because you were so happy being a godless person in a very sick and sinful world, jesus doesn't want you to remain in the darkness, come to the light experience his love for you this is a very personal decision  there is no other way to have your sins washed away and be made clean. Jesus said I am the way the life and the truth. Jesus.said he is the truth wow what a statement.

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,"Ima just ‚Äúspoil‚Äù and take a guess at how this movie is gonna end and the basis of it.

Main character is a girl who grew up in America and is now learning that she wasn‚Äôt born there. She‚Äôs then forced to leave by the next day and she meets this guy (love interests) who writes poetry. He bets that he can make her fall in love with him and throughout the day she falls for him and as the time approaches for her to leave, she‚Äôs going to be at the airport or train station when he‚Äôll be there with either documentation that‚Äôll help her stay with him and they‚Äôll be together in the end...

It‚Äôs very easy to predict these kinds of movies... it‚Äôs the same formula:
1. Main focus is a relatable boy or girl who is a young adult or teen.
2. They meet or know someone who will soon become the love interest
3. There is conflict that‚Äôll either take the main character or love interest away from either or
4. Main character does an extravagant act of love to get to the love interest 
5. They end up in the end or something good happens to them in the end which wraps up in a monologue that talks about what happens after that.

The formula applies to any setting or genre. Which reminds me of the other point in the formula:
6. Main character or love interest is different in some way, be it: species, race, status, family rivalries, personality, school status, interests, life goals, gender, or even if they‚Äôre dead (see ‚Äúwarm bodies‚Äù for this point)

I‚Äôm not a fan of these types of films but I am aware tropes/formula seen and used for these films

I wish the boyfriends who will be dragged to this movie luck when it comes out! Hopefully she‚Äôll have a good time watching the movie with you! ;3",2019-05-10T21:00:10.000Z,9

Also based on the trailer I am assuming that they fall in love together so there is no reason why u should see this other than you want to waste your money on a story u already know how it's going to end 
Also I am guessing there will be something negative about Trump since she has to leave and she wasn't born in USA even though that is silly  since they made the film after the best seller according to the new York's Times

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,"To all those wondering why people have a problem with the casting of this movie:

On the surface it may seem that the people complaining are doing way too much and overly concerned with race but it‚Äôs more nuanced than that. Hollywood has a history of whitewashing characters of color that are written as black or Asian (as these characters were). Colorism, or the preference for mixed and lighter skinned people over those with darker skin is also a huge issue. The fact that in a story written about a fully Korean man and black Jamaican woman they found two actors that are half white is very telling that Hollywood still has a problem seeing people of color as attractive unless they‚Äôre mixed with white. It‚Äôs so rare to see fully Asian men and darker skinned black women in movies, let alone as romantic partners- so yes, the casting directors really dropped the ball on a great opportunity and gave us more of the same",2019-05-08T14:31:09.000Z,590

This movie is not a movement, it's just a movie. It does not matter if they got some things off. It's an **ADAPTATION** not a copy. I think it is fun to see how they interpreted the book. 
Again, it is just a fucking adaptation. If they just followed the story word by word like in the book, it would get boring since people who have read the book would already know everything. Of course it's gotta be different boo-boo's.
Also, there is no ""full race/origin"", so even in the book, if Natasha says she is a 100% Jamaican, she's not. We're all not fully *insertorigin*. We're fucking mixed.",2019-04-28T09:20:42.000Z,0

Take Colin Powell for example. Both of these men are full Jamaican. No parental mixing. But both have very different skin tones.  Are they both black? Yes. But their ethnicity is obviously West Indian/West African. 

I mean...go to Jamaica. Walk around.  You will actually find a lot of women who have a very similar complexion as Yara. And you'll find some even lighter. I have relatives in my own family, 100% Jamaican, and as light as the chick from the movie 'Everything, everything'. So take it with a grain of salt. Are 'Regina King' skinned women underrepresented in Hollywood? A case could certainly be made, but unfortunately complaining about it won't provide an immediate solution.

I can understand your views and all, but damn. Does it matter? At the end of the day, we're all black. We're all human. Getting pissed because of the color of somebody's skin is just not right. Racism is going to kill us all one day. Hell. I'm in Chicago and here black folks are killing each other because of this skin color shit, among other things. And if we ain't killing each other, black folks are killing themselves because they're being excluded from communities consisting of their own people because they're either ""too light"", or ""too dark"". Y'all honestly gotta get your shit together. Y'all are stuck on those slavery days, and that shit is over now. And it's true, we still have things to fight about with our race, but turning against one another won't help. Light skinned or dark. If you wanna get technical, the Native Americans should be pissed too! Got their land stolen from them, their race was enslaved and killed off, and there's barely any damn Natives alive today. So THEY should be the ones complaining. I don't see not ONE person of Native descent on a movie nowadays. So stop this shit. Honestly, we all have better shit to protest about.

I'm not saying anything bad about how they don't do the same things but it made me realize, I'll never be able to see myself in a character on a movie. For everyone who isn't mixed, you get so many characters out there that you can look at and relate to, even if you're black and have only started getting those movies recently. You guys are lucky in that way I guess. Who makes mixed characters in movies though? Interracial couples sure but I've never seen a mixed race character. I wish I could for once have someone to relate to where identity is such a big problem sometimes and I want to know I'm not alone, where I'm not the only one who doesn't look like my birth mother.

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,"Dear black koreaboos and weebs, don't get starry eyed. East-Asian men are not going to date us 9.9 times out of 10. For every one black female lucky enough to be in that tiny percentage that CAN land an East-Asian man, there's tens of millions more who never will. And when East-Asian men DO go after ""black"" women they tend to be mixed chicks and light bright damn near white chicks. 

DO NOT hold out hope for some fairytale relationship with a Korean, Japanese, or Chinese dude - it isn't happening for 99% of you......AND THAT'S ALRIGHT!
We can't change the culture overnight, we can't make other races value our beauty or put it on par with light skin women at the snap of our fingers, but we're heading in the right direction......just don't let bullshit movies like this distract you from REALITY....stop chasing men and people who don't value us..",2019-04-17T14:47:28.000Z,0

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,"The problem is Natasha is full Jamaican and Daniel is full Korean. How hard is it to find an actor who actually fits the position. All people should have representation but the context of the story is of a 100% Jamaican girl and 100% Korean boy. It is a very important factor of the story.  Its important because Natasha's family is straight from Jamaica as well as Daniel's from Korea.

Also the people who made this movie missed other really important parts of the book. The pink headphones Natasha's father got her when they got to the U.S. She chose pink because she was a kid and they were her favorite color. Its important to have that emotional attachment for the story. Daniel is supposed to have a ponytail because it is one of the things that first really attracted Natasha.

I am so disappointed

Edit: I'm sorry that I assumed everyone read the book. In the book Daniels parents immigrated from Korea and Natasha and her family came into the U.S from Jamaica. I did not mean to come off as saying ethnically either of them have to be 100% of anything. I really just meant thats where they came from.",2019-05-01T04:06:38.000Z,959

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,"To everyone that‚Äôs commenting about the movie‚Äôs casting choices, and the differences compared to the book:

1. As someone who‚Äôs read the book, I get the concern some people have with the casting choices. It really does feel like Hollywood is only ever casting Zendaya, Amandla, and Yara for black female roles. However, I want to believe that Nicola Yoon chose Yara and Charles for good reasons. And while Yara is not Jamaican, and Charles is only partially Asian, I still hope that they can live up to the roles of the amazing characters that Yoon has created.

2. I understand how different the movie looks compared to the book so far. However, if the movie was exactly like the book, there‚Äôd be no point in watching the movie. I think that, if there were changes, they might have been made to adapt to how much the way people act has changed since when the book came out. Every new generation is more and more different, and I think Yoon is trying to this change.",2019-03-05T03:51:07.000Z,0

It is an empirical fact that the lighter your skin is and the closer your features are to whiteness, the more opportunities, praise, and benefits you receive from society. There is a reason why Hollywood has a long history of white-washing its characters and replacing roles meant for non-biracial people played by biracial actors who are closer in proximity to whiteness in order to appease the mainstream masses. What really grinds my gears is how so many people deny the existence of race privilege but believe in looks privilege to some degree.

It would be nice to have more dark skin representation, especially in romantic comedies. I think Yara is pretty but I think someone with tighter curls and darker skin should have been cast unless if they had no one else, I mean its really up to the people who do the castings I mean if they can only imagine a romance with a light skin girl or white girl then that's their issue, even tho I am very lightskin(black, white, and inuit) I believe there should be more representation because dark skin people have still been watching rom-coms wanting more representation, trying to relate to these movies all the time and white people can easily sit down and try to relate to a darkskin rom com if they wanted to, its not difficult.",2019-02-12T02:29:34.000Z,0

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,"I don't understand why everyone is having this lightskin vs. darkskin debate when the real issue here is that she's mixed race. America needs to stop labelling literally anyone who's not 100% white as black. It's damaging. And what happens is, these biracial leads start to label themselves as black too, so when it's time to cast, technically you guys can't complain. Because white Hollywood will simply say, ""but we gave you a *black* lead, didn't we?""

Asking for roles for ""darkskin"" women is not addressing the issue. The issue here is that roles that could be used to create exposure to fresh new black faces, are being handed to people who YOUR society has deemed as black in the first place. Then it creates this debate of ""not black enough"" when factually pointed out that said person is biracial, not black.  It's an endless cycle, with a very simple solution. Stop getting emotional about something that doesn't need to be a problem. Call biracials biracial, and blacks black. That closes all the loopholes and the division of light and dark skin (which, by using those titles, is actually further nurturing colourism).",2019-02-11T16:29:07.000Z,19

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,"The frustration over Yara being cast has to do with the fact that the character is described to be darker than Yara‚Äôs skin tone and have a different hair texture in the book. While it IS progress in this industry that a black girl was cast as the lead, the decision was still very intentional to choose someone lighter skinned vs. someone darker skinned. And considering the book DOES say her nationality is Jamaican, you would HAVE to have a black girl play the role in this scenario regardless. So the fact that it‚Äôs a light skin girl is very telling. Now, I think we all know why they chose a lighter skinned girl... because she‚Äôs more palatable to the industry, of course. But if they only have one kind of skin tone being the representative for ALL black girls, what does that continue to tell viewers, especially dark skinned black girls? That lighter skinned black females ARE prettier, more palatable, and better looking etc. You get my point. It‚Äôs like we take 2 steps forward (casting a black girl) and 3 steps back (she‚Äôs not the skin tone specified). And in a way, I would consider it more harmful that they use a lighter skinned female for the above reasons. So as long as we continue to go forward with these actions of choosing lighter skinned females  to play the roles of darker skinned females, we are hardly moving forward with this issue of colorism in the industry. And in the meantime, it continues to offend black females of the darker skinned community.",2019-02-11T08:06:49.000Z,76

But we're still peddling in the idea that there needs to be some degree of whiteness (Charles isn't fully Asian and Yara is hella light-skinned) for a film to be profitable or more importantly, palatable. by mainstream America.

The two big questions are: 1. Are hapas/light-skinned people less Asian/Black than their full Asian/dark-skinned counter parts? 2. Is Hollywood still subtly racist for casting them?

We act like one is entirely related to the other, making them mutually exclusive. I think the the answer to both questions is YES. We cannot deny someone their racial identity for being half-white or lightskinned. But by casting them in roles meant for racially unambiguous actors, Hollywood is denying all of us our humanity.",2019-02-09T23:48:41.000Z,348

I am disappointed that the main character isn‚Äôt as I imagined but that doesn‚Äôt make me not like the film any less. I did not support this film for that support the film for the story it‚Äôs about to tell. Which I think everybody should do. If you aren‚Äôt going to support it just cause of the casting and you aren‚Äôt seeing it as how it should be, beautiful. I‚Äôm going to say I don‚Äôt understand you. 

Also, the film seem to cater to different races falling in love. Not about the actors or actress‚Äôs race itself 

1) I‚Äôm done going through the comment and seeing a ton of hate on the film cause of the casting which the author did participate in picking herself btw. Everybody got mad about everything everything because the actress isn‚Äôt Jamaican. The author is and not all Jamaican are dark. (I know she said dark but maybe to Jamaicans brown is dark) just like how tan or brown is dark for Asians. If you read some book coming from another country, and they were to describe somebody brown like in Asia, they say dark. They call my brother extremely dark. He‚Äôs just brown like turkey (I can call my brother that shit cause oof he‚Äôs my bro I love him tho) 

2) Asians don‚Äôt have a specific look! I HATE it when people said, ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt look Asian‚Äù okay, well, sir! What do you think is Asian?! He looks Asian enough to me. I‚Äôve got cousins that look like him and they‚Äôre full on Asian. Don‚Äôt go defining Asians just cause.

3) Clothing ain‚Äôt gonna be the same obviously. We‚Äôre gonna know who read the book and who didn‚Äôt when fan arts come out üòÇ 

4) People don‚Äôt get mad over the casting of To All the Boys I‚Äôve loved Before. And the main character ain‚Äôt even Korean üòÇ she‚Äôs Vietnamese! And they missed major things. I‚Äôm not surprised about cause it‚Äôs done by awesomeness TV

5) If you‚Äôre half Asian half white people judge you cause you‚Äôre half white. But if you‚Äôve got a parent who‚Äôs white white. But the both of em will be like Swedish or German. We don‚Äôt call them out as that we just say white. If you‚Äôre half white half (Asian, Mexican, black) people are gonna call you out white. And white is gonna call you out as (Asian, Mexican, Black) which shouldn‚Äôt be the case. We should all just love each other regardlessly 

6) They could‚Äôve casted somebody else and it‚Äôs true maybe these people are who the author saw. Or who the judges saw as the characters. Because even though you‚Äôre a famous actor. Or you‚Äôre well known in one show/movie. That money can‚Äôt keep you surviving forever. You still have to live like normal human beings make money. These people are actors and actresses. Understand they‚Äôre doing their jobs. They‚Äôre suppose to go out there finding roles. And if it‚Äôs a big role, that‚Äôs great!",2019-02-09T04:33:07.000Z,0

2019-02-06T16:00:13.000Z,3On0BXzGnuI,THE SUN IS ALSO A STAR - Official Trailer,I feel like instead of boycotting and hating on the one romantic movie with a black girl in it we should be more critical of the thousands and thousands of movies staring white women. Light skin/biracial women definitely get more representation than dark skin women but they get .0001% of the amount white women get. I feel like instead of arguing over the one role Black women get a year we should be trying to take up more of the space white women monopolize so that black women of all shades/hair textures can thrive.,2019-02-09T00:24:53.000Z,23

Now based on the comments, I‚Äôve realized that some darker skinned black women see anyone who is lighter than them as light skinned. I am slightly confused by that association. Nonetheless I understand, though I have not lived as a darker woman of color, their frustrations in them being underrepresented in Hollywood and when they are, they tend to be hyper-sexualized and/or portrayed in a stereotypical way. Let‚Äôs please acknowledge that. However, the film is already made. Let‚Äôs appreciate that Hollywood is incorporating more people of color in major films (Asians included). Let‚Äôs try to enjoy what I hope is a good portrayal of a beautiful excellent book. And let‚Äôs not negate the struggle of one based off the skin tone. Many people of color whether you are biracial or not have experienced discrimination in various aspects of life. The problem with social justice is that people love to say their problems or struggles matter more or have more meaning than the next. I for one will be in attendance. üôåüèΩ",2019-02-08T23:44:09.000Z,146

They are just envious that it makes them angry to see a talented girl, who is prettier than you on the big screen. Maybe they do not hire completely black girls, because THEY PREFER TO BE FIGHTING, MAKING THE VICTIMS, AND COMPLAINING THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS OTHERS, ONLY FOR THEIR SKIN TONE. It is clear to see that the most racist people that exist are the same black people. Definitely, they are still mental slaves.

The issue is not with her its with the fact that Hollywood and popular media want to foisture their standard of beauty i.e. whiteness upon us. So non-white people are considered prettier/ acceptable the closer they are to whiteness. Black people come in all shades yes. However the evidence shows (e.g. Zoe Saldana in the Nina Simone Biopic, Amandla Sternberg in the Hate U Give, Halle Berry/Alexandra Shipp as Storm etc...) that Hollywood likes casting lighter skinned women in roles where the character is depicted as darker skinned or the person is actually darker skinned. Its problematic. Also because Amandla Sternberg gets to play Starr in the Hate U Give who is written as a darker skinned girl and then she gets to play a bi-racial girl in the upcoming WW2 romance ""Where hands touch"" a role which a dark skinned black girl would not be allowed to do.

It's hypocritical when people say its no big deal. Penelope Cruz who is an actual latin woman would never be cast as a white woman from Finland. Lupita Nyong'o would never be cast as a bi-racial woman. But Emma Stone gets cast as half Hawaiian/half Asian woman and bi-racial girls get cast in roles that are written/depicted as darker skinned girls. Its the height of hypocrisy and at its root is a latent racism/colorism that pervades most societies of today.",2019-02-08T09:39:56.000Z,1

We are saying that we hate that our erasure within popular culture makes us feel like we are not good enough when ALL black girls are supposed to be magic. I do believe we are all black no matter if you‚Äôre dark skinned, light skinned, medium -whatever. But if that is true then surely we should be represented all shades, all body types, all hair-types. This used to be my favourite book but I‚Äôm not sure I can support this film or any other like it until YA adaptation genre changes and soon.

I pictured the female lead as a darkskin afro rocking girl and the male as korean. None of them look like how the characters are described.

I think getting racial ambiguous or biracial actors who have a closer proximity to whiteness is a sell out to appease white mainstream audiences. It could have been symbolic and groundbreaking to see two ethnic ppls who are not mixed or ambiguous. Asian and Black couple is such a rare thing to find in the world.

Me wanting to see more dark skin actresses as leading roles doesn't make me ""insecure"" that doesn't even make any fucking sense. I'm not hating on light skinned people wtf? And yes, I'm fully aware of there being light skinned people in Jamaica üôÑ all I'm saying is that, MOST Jamaicans are not light skin with loose hair texture, and it's typical for Hollywood to yet again cast another light skin black girl to portray a leading black character. Stop trying to take my words out of context and ignore the reality if the situation. The movie and Television industry has been colorist for years and gives light skinned girls the leading role, while the dark skin girls are often casted as a side kick of the light skin black girl ie: Martin, Proud Family, Dear Black People, etc. I want yall to list for me 5 A list dark skin black female celebrities under the age of 26 right now that aren't Yara, Amandla, or Zendaya. I'll wait.


Smdh it's a shame. Natasha is full Jamaican and most Jamaican girls don't look like biracial black women with loose curl pattern hair. Most are dark skin with afro textured hair. Hollywood is colorist af. I wasn't picturing a light skinned chick for Natasha who is supposedly born in a black nation.",2019-02-08T13:50:05.000Z,50

I don‚Äôt approve of a non-Jamaican person playing a Jamaican role about immigration (something Yara can‚Äôt relate to) in a family that doesn‚Äôt even look like her. Surprised they didn‚Äôt pull out the faux Jamaican accent. I would‚Äôve been even more appalled. On top of that the colorism is very evident in the family casting. How is the family darkskin with kinky type 4 hair but Yara gets to be light skin with loose curls? She sticks out like a odd thumb. So does the Asian guy.
