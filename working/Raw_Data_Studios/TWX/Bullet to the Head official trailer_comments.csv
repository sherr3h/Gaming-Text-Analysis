And on special, too.  25% off from $1.75.  Wednesday.  Old fogey's day.  Not a bad deal, considering.  This is latter-day Walter Hill.  An aged Pro fondly looking back.  I was in my early 20's when I saw his early action-cut holler jobs. ""Hard Times"". ""The Driver"".  ""The Warriors"".  Classic genre movies with a single vision.  The best against the bad.  Later on the scope got broader: ""The Long Riders"", ""Southern Comfort"", ""48 hours"", ""Streets of Fire"".  Afterwards,  it was all mostly blink-n-flash.  This one, ""Bullet to the Head"", is quite decent, done with lots of style.  Good buy.  No big complaints.  A nit: Sly shoulda worn a beaten-up brown leather jacket.",2019-01-03T15:15:20.000Z,0

EPIC WIN !

And lol at people pretending he looks that good because of steroids.

The guy is 66 years old and he looks like a man in his 40s.

Steroids aren't supposed to make you younger at all, he is aging extremely well.

But most importantly he has a great WORK ETHIC.

This guy is an absolute icon , steroid or not.

There's only one Sylvester Stallone and he is improving like a good wine as the years are passing on.
