Prince William cheated on Princess Catherine Middleton awhile back and British celebrities were in here trying to make a big deal about it.  Prince William and Princess Catherine dont have a real marriage relationship its just something on tv to show off and legal but when it comes to being husband and wife like how NORMAL people are no.,2019-09-11T14:49:59.000Z,0

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"One of my favorite movies, especially in the action/alien category.  There are definitely a couple faults with the movie but a few things that I really like about it are that Tom Cruise doesn't start off like the typical badass that he is in all of his other movies.  What I mean by this is that he doesn't fly F-14's with Goose, he's not a race car driver, he's not Ethan Hunt... he's a wimp that does publicity stunts to basically generate war bonds so he can avoid fighting... so essentially he's a coward.  This is totally unlike his other movies where he can defeat just about anyone or anything at the towering height of 5'7"" tall.  I like it how he grows into his character by starting off as a wimp and going from there to be a soldier, again unlike his other movies.  I also love how it's like playing a video game, as I love playing Halo, and it's basically like playing a level, dying and restarting it again yet learning what you did wrong and how you can get better and better until you eventually beat the game.  Lastly, Emily Blunt is in the movie, so it's difficult not to like a movie that she's in, especially when she's such a badass.",2019-05-02T20:34:01.000Z,2

The arrogance was only a facade for what I was too afraid to face: that, deep down, I was living a lie. I didn't know what I wanted to make of myself, that I was too afraid to admit that I was only a speck of what I perceived myself as. Blaming them was just a pernicious way I could relieve myself of the responsibility of forging for myself a better life.  Live, Die, Repeat. I was too afraid to start phase two.

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"This movie not only is based off a great manga called ""All You Need Is Kill"", but it also has ties to Norse mythology.

NORSE MYTHOLOGY
In the V√∂lsunga Saga the main character is a man named Sigurd/Siegfried he has a long story but I'll mention the important parts. Sigurd kills a dragon and bathes in its blood to gain invulnerability, he also eats it's heart to gain wisdom, intellect, and the ability to communicate with animals. 

The gods reward him by giving him a bride that is imprisoned in a fortress with a moat of fire protecting it. The bride is a Valkyrie (a Norse battle angel sent by the gods) with red hair, who disobeyed orders and didn't kill the right person in battle, so her power was stripped from her and she was put in a comatose prison. Sigurd kisses her, she wakes up, falls in love with him, and (for reasons that aren't relevant to the movie) she kills him. 


[[[[ WARNING SPOILERS BELOW ]]]]


EDGE OF TOMORROW

In Edge of Tomorrow, Cage is showered in the Alpha's (Dragon) blood; gets invulnerability via time loop to overcome any foe;  gains wisdom through dying, sacrificing, and seeing others do so; gets intellect from training and strategizing with Rita; and gets communication with the Omega (another species) via telepathy, and (arguably) Rita via time spent with her and being able to relate to her in a way no one else can because of the time loop power.

In the movie Cage first meets Rita by going through the wall of fire that is the battlefield. Rita herself has red hair, red armor, and is known as ""The Angel of Verdun"" (in the manga she's even known as ""The Valkyrie""). She had supernatural powers but they were lost when she didn't kill the right person, herself. She becomes distant and secludes herself from everybody but her techy friend. Eventually Cage gets to know her over his months in the time loop and falls in love with her, she eventually falls in love with him in what is only a day for her, bringing her out of her solitude. Also, she kills Cage. Like a lot.

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"Just watched the movie and came here to see if anyone else had mentioned the opinion I myself had of the movie, but I seem to be the only one who thought that this movie was Groundhog Day meeting The Matrix 3. I have seen 4 more time loop movies apart from GHD and EOT, hard to say which was best, I do love TC movies and EOT was still pretty good, probably best of the 6 TL movies I've seen.

I did enjoy them all at the end of the day, Primer was way too overcomplicated to the point of not being too enjoyable, About Time is great if you prefer avoiding violence and special effects, Source Code is a nice watch, and while The Triange (2009) is a bit bloody it's probably my next fav after EOT because of its mindfucking ability which is not taken to extreme like Primer and there is at least some action, making it probably the most memorable one for me of the six.

If The Source with its reincarnation feature counted as a time loop movie it would win obviously, but then if you are looking for timeloopers specifically then it would probably disappoint. It's about the higher self, the only one, apart from maybe Revolver.",2017-07-26T00:26:50.000Z,0
2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"I bought the two volumes of ""all you need is kill"" and then I found out that this film was based on the manga and I didn't wanted to watch it. Because, I thought it would be terrible and the main character wasn't like Keiji, his nationality being different and kind of pissed me off since Rita is the same, but probably it's because she is American in the manga too. But in the other day, I watched it on TV and what can I say is: wow. It isn't bad after all. It‚Äôs good! But for me, the manga is still more entertaining since it's the original story. Edge of tomorrow it's completely different from All you need is kill, the main character haves another personality, another name, another nationality. The plot is not the same, even thought that the principal idea is the same. I recommend all of you to read the manga! It's really good! Even thought, it haves other ending. (Before I watched it, my dad told me that this movie had a good ending and I was pissed off because at least I wanted the ending to be the same but it was better that way)",2017-07-25T16:41:29.000Z,0

It made me so happy to see it was based off the manga/novel cause omg I really like both versions a lot!! ^^ Its nice to see manga make it to American movies haha

Also just some cool similarities besides story I found:
In the books the girl who also repeats time is also called ""Full Metal Bitch""
In the books the guy who repeats time's nickname is ""Killer Cage"" and in movie his name is Cage
At one point in the movie/books both the main guys try to escape it all and give up
The Full Metal Bitch uses a sword/axe in books like the movie",2017-04-16T05:25:14.000Z,0

A question for the people who have seen the movie,cause i think i didn't get this part: How does she knows that she's lost the 'power'? To know, she needs to die in order to come back and know that she actually did die (still has the power) or she just dies and she can't come back (doesn't have it) and she will never know. But that can't happen because Cruise will always meet her before her 'final die' and she already knows that she's lost it. Also it can't be because of the visions. Cruise got the visions of the omega when he died, so she can't know,because she would have died aaand..same story^. And also not that thingy from whitehall that Cruise puts in his leg and sees the real omega, because the didn't have it before. So how does she know? Is it because she lived more days since vendan or something, where she lost her 'power' because of the piles of blood from someone else?

liked the movie though :)",2015-06-03T21:34:36.000Z,2

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"Edge of tomorrow and oblivion same storyline almost. 
Tom Cruise remembers something from past in oblivion even though his memory wiped out. 
In edge of tomorrow he is supposed to forget that he went to war already but he still remembers. 
(coz he is the Tom Cruise he has good memory) 
In both movies they sort of blow up the alien headquarters or source to get rid of them. 
In both movies they sort of survive n come back to their girlfriend(s).

And I'm really disappointed that this movie didn't make a profit, I hope more movies like this come out because the number of generic ""rags-to-riches"" stories where the protagonist gets a trophy wife is overbearing to me.

Hollywood shouldn't take this loss of profit as a queue to revert back to generic and despicably predictable movies. This one gets my approval, 10/10 and I really hope more like it come out in the future.",2015-01-31T02:53:32.000Z,2

¬†You cant just KILL a Boss in DARK SOULS without dying a 100 times to get there. Everyone remembers that section in games where you need to have MASTERY in every single detail to get it done, and reload the last checkpoint until your eyes get red. ¬†

Needless to say, this movie is Awesome!",2015-01-19T00:28:33.000Z,5

i'm also surprised that nobody has noticed before that Hamburg is nowhere near the place from where the aliens begun to spread (according to the map)

The premise of the movie is that every time an Alpha is killed, the Omega resets the day to learn from its mistakes. Cage then becomes an Alpha of sorts, because killing him will also make the Omega reset the day. Now, why is it that only Cage learns from its mistakes, changes his tactics, knows where the enemy will appear, etc., and not the Omega? Cage even memorizes where the mimics will attack, what shows that the Omega is simply repeating the day without changing a thing. And it is not that the Omega cannot change anything... the visions are a change, and they appear after many resets. So why not change its tactics to abduct Cage, instead of mentally luring him into a trap?¬†",2014-10-23T03:01:19.000Z,0

With all these sad overacting disney and nickelodeon actors and actresses trying to take on big roles and basically destroying them, the future of movies looks very bleak...with the exception of jennifer lawrence¬†

Rita killed hundreds of Mimics on her 1st day in battle so does this mean she died after killing an Alpha & trained herself like Cage did, and fought this battle infinite amount of times? In her final attempt, she lost the ability because she got injured & got a blood transfusion.
So was she very good in fighting all along at Verdun or she kept training in timeloop? I am confused because when they finally got to the farmhouse/helicopter on 'D-day' (Operation end-game), Rita had died in battle many times with Cage even though he gave him prior tips on where the enemy was. Without Cage's tips, it seems she is not that good? Rita even commented on Cage's tips ''U got to be specific, otherwise I am dead.''",2014-09-05T19:21:29.000Z,0

That said, cruise didn't do his annoying over-acting crap he usually does. Maybe he finally took acting classes, I don't know but he was quite good in this movie because he was not trying to be quite good. He simply slipped into his characters shoes and played the guy and let the story do the rest. good job Tom.  This plot-type, as I said has been done before but maybe not this well. The script built plot throughout the entire movie and moved the story along at a rapid pace without confusing the viewers and without any meaningless filler dialog. This was a really good movie and Tom Cruise was impressive. Something he's usually not. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and I plan to buy the DVD when it comes out.

For an action film it does bring one to think how ridiculous most Hollowood action films are. I mean how many impossible situations have leading characters been in and always come out on top. 

In many cases without a scratch on them.  
EOT restores the realism and mundanity to action blockbusters. While questioning the untouchable nature of an action hero. Reality would have set in ling ago. 

At just how impossible a task your up against. I mean i cringe to think how many times i would have gone through this to no avail. For yet another meeting with the Undertaker lol.

EOT provides an excellent opportunity to question what a life is worth in these films. If some of you were on the fence about seeing this. I fully recommend you do. The trailers don't do this film any favors. Great movie and well worth my time. :)",2014-07-14T04:01:36.000Z,0

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"*SPOILERS*
Soooo one of the plausible explanations for the confusing ending would be...

Whenever an Alpha dies, Omega resets time to an earlier point when the Alpha is alive, and lets it retain the memory from the previous loop so it can do better in this new instance. After Cage killed the Alpha on the beach, and got poured with its blood, he became the Alpha and replaced it in all the following loops. That's why we don't see the Alpha again on the beach in all of the later loops. At the moment, "" Wake up, maggot"", the Alpha on the beach dies right away because it is replaced by Cage in this instance. At the end of the movie, Cage killed the Omega and got the blood too, he then again became the Omega and replaced it in the new loop. So when he woke up in the chopper, that exact moment, the Omega dies, because in this instance it is replaced by Cage.

The explanation about Cage being brought back further in time to him being in the chopper rather than his original first loop to "" Wake up, maggot."" would be the fact that whenever he is brought back to "" Wake up, maggot"", he dies on the day of the beach battle or during the beach battle. But what happened when he killed the Omega was, he died on the night before the beach battle, so maybe that is why he is brought back a day earlier during the time reset loop as well.",2014-06-25T02:18:00.000Z,0

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"What's the best & worst movie you've seen in 2014 so far?

[ SPOILERS ]


Worst - Godzilla

I went in with high expectations but damn what a letdown this movie was.
The trailer is probably one of the most well done trailer ever made that makes you think
"" wow this is gonna be so epic & there is no way this movie will be a letdown ""
but like srsly. Also the trailer is hella misleading, it makes you think
Godzilla is the actual threat, but no it's the Mutos. Ye, those are gonna send
us back to stone age. -.-
Mutos got more screen time than Godzilla. They probably should have just
called this movie Muto.
The first half is a bore fest. In fact, things don't really pick up until about 90 minutes in. Every time you think a fight is going to happen the movie just cuts to something else. I was astounded.
It wasn't even the lack of Godzilla fighting that made this movie boring to watch, it was the lack of Godzilla doing anything at all.¬†

If you like drama + alot of side stories and 5 minutes of action then this is the right movie for you!
Ye, I am kinda angry now since I am a huge Godzilla fan, but this movie was a huge disappointment.
The biggest disappointment I have seen so far this year.
What was the director thinking while making this movie?


Best - Edge of Tomorrow

I went in with low expectations and came out speechless.
Hell I am not a Tom Cruise fan and tbh I don't like his movies at all, but
this movie was so good - words can't even describe how epic this movie is.
You have to see it to know what's up lol.
No srsly, in case you haven't seen it yet, go and see it!
The trailer was kinda "" ye hm looks like a decent movie with some cool special effects and explosions ""
but it's so much better than this.¬†

I don't wanna spoil anything here lol, just go and see it yourself.
For me this is not only the best movie of 2014 so far, but one of the top 10 movies I have seen all time.

in my opinion",2014-06-23T19:00:35.000Z,127

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"It was ok, though not as good as I'd hoped. Potential plot holes in the time reset thing aside, what really bothered me is the complete lack of realism in how humanity dealt with the aliens. Everyone knows we'd be sending swarms of drones & (cruise) missiles equipped with tactical and strategic nukes, not soldiers in clunky power armor. To basically use WW2-era tactics in the 21st century is ridiculous. Reminds me of Starship Troopers, where their 'strategy' consisted of sending poorly organized soldiers armed with ARs against the alien hordes, instead of assraping them from the air with drone strikes or sending in expendable autonomous ground vehicles or humanoid robots (hey, it's the future and they have spaceships n stuff, so why not advanced robots?).¬†

These aliens, which incidentally look totally unoriginal, basically Matrix Sentinels mashed up with a bunch of other cliches, only have some kind of (homing?) missiles and melee capabilities. Find a way to confuse or otherwise neutralize their missiles and they'd be sitting ducks against air attacks. Sending in (human) ground forces is about the dumbest thing you can do. I know, it adds drama to the movie, but the total lack of realism is grating.¬†

Also, why didn't the aliens invade England sooner? Looks like all they had to do is swim across the Channel.¬†",2014-06-15T15:09:00.000Z,9

This was amazingly entertaining...i have to give Tom Cruise alot of credit, he's been making blockbusters and feature movies for as long as i can remember, i'm 30 now and his blockbuster movies have been from as far back as Top Gun which came out when i was about 3 years old and he's still going strong to this day, and Edge of Tomorrow is further proof of that!Ôªø

Although NOT mentioned in the description (which it should be), Edge of Tomorrow is a adaptation of the popular novel and manga called 'All you need is Kill'.

The name Cage actually derives from the name Japanese name Keiji, which is the name of the main character. The name came about in the novel when American soldiers pronounced Keiji as Cage. While Rita's name remains unchanged.",2014-06-08T05:47:12.000Z,0

How did tom cruise reset time at the end, even after having a blood transfusion ?
Is it because the blood of the omega spilled on him under water ?
Here there are¬†many questions ?
1. Does it mean Tom Hanks will forever be immortal ?
2. After he resets time in the end, does it mean the whole omega battle never happened ? If ""yes"", it means¬†the Omega never existed¬†in the past¬†or future.
And if the Omega never existed, then¬†Emily Blunt wouldn't have been called the ""Angel of Verdun"" in her previous battle, because there would've been no¬†Omega in the first place.

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"Wow - this was unexpected. The trailers had me believe that after 'Battle L.A.' and 'Oblivion' this would be yet another bleak, action- packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about an alien invasion - what the trailers failed to convey almost entirely is that over long stretches, this is also seasoned with nearly as much humor as 'Groundhog Day'. That it would invite comparisons with the Harold Ramis/ Bill Murray classic was obvious, given the time loop premise, but I never expected to what extent those comparisons would actually be justified and that this film would really tap into a similar kind of comedy. Luckily, it is all the better for it.

Most unexpected of all, the main reason the comical aspects during the first half of the film work so well, is Tom Cruise's character, Major William Cage. This is easily Cruise's meatiest role since his turn in 'Magnolia' as Frank T.J. Mackey; forget his usual stern, poster boy heroes: here he plays an entirely different character ‚Äì and he really seems to relish the opportunity. I won't give away too much, but be prepared to chuckle and laugh when you see a new side of Tom Cruise.

Yet while this is not nearly as bleak as the trailers suggested, it certainly isn't a comedy either. And it absolutely IS an action-packed, special effects driven Sci-Fi blockbuster about battling an alien invasion (the trailers got that right), albeit one with a funny bone and great characters. Speaking of which, the rest of the cast is also very good, especially the gorgeous Emily Blunt. It seems that no matter what she does, she always comes across as genuine and real; here she succeeds in portraying her character - a tough, seasoned soldier other soldiers refer to as ""full metal bitch"" (no kidding!) - with just the right touch of vulnerability to make her that much more believable. Bill Paxton and Brendon Gleeson are always a welcome addition to any movie, and while they are great (as usual), character-wise, they don't do anything here that you haven't seen them do before.

As for the Sci-Fi spectacle that the trailers promised, I'm glad to report that the film delivers. The battle scenes are beautifully orchestrated (not the Transformer-style blur where you can't make out anything anymore), and there are moments when the intensity of the fighting recalls the landing on Omaha Beach in 'Saving Private Ryan' - without the gore, obviously (after all, this is PG-13). The design of the aliens - the production design in general - is incredibly well done, although I would lie if I said it was something ground-breaking and new the way the first 'Matrix' was (it IS breathtaking, though).

So my verdict: With one of the most inventive (adapted) scripts for an original (mega-budget) film in a long time and the best Tom Cruise we've seen in years, 'Edge of Tomorrow' will have you chuckle and laugh nearly as much as drop your jaw in awe: this is what Hollywood should take as a blueprint for exciting summer entertainment henceforth. 9 stars out of 10.",2014-06-07T00:43:23.000Z,0

It may sound stupid but the fact that they can land all these people there and have a chance against the aliens means that these aliens were sub-standardly equipped for warfare which means that the armies in Europe would have been able to get rid of them by their own and there wouldn't have been a movie at all.

And if people think that the armies in Europe are a bunch of French resistance fighters I may kindly recall them that the French and the Brits have nukes and that there is the NATO with more men in arms than the US Army, and that Russia is also part of Europe... and that Europe is not just France but actually part of a whole fucking big continent called Eurasia meaning that if the Aliens were to land here there would be either so many that they would cover all Eurasia and these guys would have been screwed utterly anyway or the Aliens would have been sold as delicatesse in Beijing shortly after landing.

Sorry, but this is one of the fuck ups in the whole thing that just makes the story to become inconsistent with it's own logic.",2014-05-29T21:59:38.000Z,0

I know my spelling is bad :(
I know for a fact the US army are testing out similar exo-skeleton suits more like robots to carry heavy objects
But the fact is we are in a time that the movie is real enough and i predict in 30 to 70 years this will be made global
Just like the ""kuratas"" (KR01) but more like Spartans from the Halo merchandice - POWER SUITS
I also know there is a¬†research facility in Salt Lake City in Utah in this kind or work
and Cyberdyne HAL are being made in Japan which puts less strain on muscles!
Overall I have made my point mybe some type of exoskeleton armor will be avalible t buy soon +¬†cheap enough too !

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"A lot of people are saying things like ""Everyone knows that the movie ends happily"", or ""It's just like Groundhog Day - he figures out how to do it right in the end"", saying that the movie is too predictable and that the the movie ends happily. They're probably right, but I'm still going to see this movie. I don't care if I know how it's probably going to end. I'm probably still going to enjoy the 1 hour and 40 minutes in between.

Plenty of times, when I read a book, I flip to the back page first and read the ending (probably not the best idea but sometimes I can't help it). But I still enjoy the book in its entirety. I still don't know how the characters got to the ending, and plenty of times the events leading up to the climax make the ending much more emotional and satisfying. So if you don't want to watch this movie because you know how it's probably going to end, that's fine with me. I understand that. But a movie has a lot more to show you than just its ending.",2014-03-09T21:31:07.000Z,6

With the exception of that one specific twist at the very end that I'm almost certain will not be in the movie. I can already picture the focus groups and the executives having the director cut that twist because ""people will hate it"".¬†
While I was reading the light novel, I could see how it was extremely filmable, and how there was a lot of room for improvement on the screen, so I was excited about this movie. The thing that didn't made sense for me was having Tom Cruise has the protagonist, since he's like forty years older than the one in the book -alright, maybe thirty-. But they seem to have changed the story enough to make it fit and it's not that weird anymore.
The thing I would have loved was if they had pulled a full ethnicity switcharoo, instead of just a half one, and made Rita Japanese, maybe hire that girl from Pacific Rim to play her. That would have been a nice little treat for the people who read ""All you need is Kill"".",2014-03-06T20:45:32.000Z,0

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"C'mon, people. Stop being so naive. They are not only adapting a story from a Novel to a Movie, but also for a different culture and audience. Having that in mind, did you really expect the movie version follow the source material that closely?¬†

Since they're going for a more realistic approach (remember this is not just an aesthetic choice, but also something necessary in order to make special effects viable) I'd say the Jackets looks fine IMO, since it's actually supposed to be a mass produced piece of equipment. Considering that, a HUGE battle axe would also look completely out place. Remember that Starship Troopers movie completely dropped the power suit present in the original novel but still managed to be one hell of a movie.¬†

You could wait for a terrible Japanese Live Action movie, with some cheap CG and terrible acting, but while far from perfect, I'd say a Hollywood version is still better than the alternative.",2014-03-02T12:25:19.000Z,1

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"First of all: I don't like how they changed the title to some romantic bullshit.
When I read the 2004 novel ""All You Need Is Kill"", I was drawn in and finished it in one go. Last month I discovered a manga adaptation of it, but after reading the first 5 chapters, I wasn't really impressed. I mean they did relatively well, but it looks too childish and doesn't convey the despair of that situation very well.
¬†¬† This movie though, haha, is an absolute disgrace. They made up car and bike chases to add meaningless action, removed helmets for most scenes so that your precious star faces could get more screen-time, added weird moving guns to the armor, made the armor look really stupid (as opposed to how it's described in the book) and added stupid ambiguos/grand/apocalyptic dialogue (not one word of what they said is from the novel).
¬†¬† Almost forgot, Tom is 30 years too old for this role and Emily is too tall for her's and both their generic acting sucks. It's worthless",2014-02-11T18:56:14.000Z,18

So what's the difference between ""All You Need Is Kill"" and this movie.
I did some simple research and All You Need Is Kill is a Japanese novel published in 2004. In addition. I just started reading a manga which is also called¬†All You Need Is Kill ( like 3 days ago even though it started in Jan.).¬†

So from my understanding, this movie is based off the Novel and at the same time a manga is also created. ¬†?? ? ? ¬†?¬†",2014-02-03T03:08:30.000Z,6

It wasn't Tom Cruise, and the other just barely managed to be good. I hope it isn't true for this movie. I'm sensing some influence from District 9 as in the screenplay and direction of photography, and some Inception-ish story line. Which is a really damn good mix. But one slip can make the entire movie cheesy, and I just can't take it seriously if that happens. I hope this movie will be good. You've got my ticket so far.
Edit: Also just to add, I LOVE the music in the trailer. It just added so much more rawness. Lastly, Emily Blunt seems to be a really interesting choice for a movie like, this, as I haven't seen her in much action movies. Especially being one of the lead roles. I hope her performance shines in this movie, as she did in Looper.",2014-01-25T02:00:34.000Z,12

This has been done before by a no-name YouTuber named MidnightGrunt in his ARG series ""Magnum Opus"". Of course it's not about a war or anything, but it is very similar to the premise of this movie.",2014-01-24T22:31:58.000Z,0

(you can buy it digitally here in english :¬†http://www.amazon.com/All-You-Need-Is-Kill/dp/1421527618 ) And it was amazing. Short book but so intense. The main difference I see with the movie for now is the age of the protagonists ; too young for war in the novel vs too old for war in the movie. Now that point could be a dealbreaker depending on how they approach Tom Cruise's ""training"" and the time loop. It will probably change the emotional dynamic and this is a really important part.

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"Based on the manga ""All You Need is Kill"" with Keiji Kiriya as the main protagonist. Of course Warner Bros again has the no Asian in main roles thing going. Well at least it is not Akira where they have white guys playing Kaneda and Tetsuo. They have gone ahead and totally whitewashed the main protagonist even though there were other lead characters like Rita Vrataski and Ferrell Bartolome, both from the U.S. Armed Forces. I guess it was better to adapt for western audiences and not have any Asian lead roles again.¬† Hollywood really likes to appropriate from Japanese or Asian/Eastern cultures but always sees the inhabitants as others and not worth integrating. The studios always say they don't have any bankable Asian or Asian American stars, well how will they become bankable if they do not get any exposure.

TLDR: Whitewashing again. The movie does look interesting enough so let us see how it goes.",2013-12-16T17:39:19.000Z,0

Tom Cruise is a prisoner or civilian being drafted into combat, and his first battle is the start of an invasion, likely onto either another planet, or an infested half of our own planet. The enemies are aliens or some such, if you could not grasp that much. He goes into battle, and the invasion fails, and everyone dies, including him. But then he groundhog days' and wakes up before the invasion happens, just as he is being readied for battle. This happens again and again, with Tom Cruise Trying different things each time.

Eventually he finds someone who this has happened to before, and she understands and believes his story. She is an uber badass, and offers to train him each time after he dies until he is so bad ass that he will find a way to win the way...or something like that.

That is what I got from looking at the trailer one time, and I'm probably missing some stuff thats in there, but my point is this, they implied and told plenty in the trailer. What do the aliens look like? You will find out in the movie. Why is this happening to Tom Cruise? You will find out in the movie. What precisely does he do to win? You will find out in the damn movie!",2013-12-14T18:11:40.000Z,0

The story is told from the perspective of Keiji Kiriya, a new recruit in the United Defense Force which fights against the mysterious 'Mimics' which have laid siege to Earth. Keiji is killed on his first sortie, but through some inexplicable phenomenon wakes up having returned to the day before the battle. This retroversal continues and he now finds himself caught in a time loop as his death and resurrection repeats time and time again. Keiji's skill as a soldier grows as he passes through each time loop in a desperate attempt to change his fate.

2013-12-11T18:00:37.000Z,vw61gCe2oqI,Edge of Tomorrow - Official Trailer 1 [HD],"This movie is nothing but another Hollywood whitewash.

This movie is based on the Japanese sci-fi novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" and the original character in it was a young Japanese soldier. Instead of giving the lead role to an Asian American actor Hollywood continues its racist practice of marginalizing nonwhite actors to just stereotypes and supporting actors in favor of white actors.

Warner Brothers previously did this with Argo where the real life person that Ben Affleck was playing was Latino, they want to do it with Akira by whitewashing the Japanese characters and now they have done it with this movie here.

The ironic thing is that in the original novel there was a female character who was a white American meaning you could've still have a white person in a lead role if you followed the characters' ethnicities as in the original novel but the fact that Warner Brothers and Doug Liman whitewashed the main character from a young Japanese character to Tom Cruise shows that Hollywood is a white supremacist institution.Ôªø",2013-12-12T18:55:18.000Z,7

When will these people learn that MORE IS NOT BETTER.
If you want to shoot a combat scene with CG, it has to be a lot SLOWER paced, make sure to put in combat lulls (because combat isn't non-stop mayhem. ¬†It's pronounced with periods of lulls, then suddenly a burst of small arms fire and explosions, followed by more lulls). ¬†And in between these lulls is when the director has to create that sense of FEAR and ANXIETY within the soldiers. ¬†It's the silent moments that people begin fearing for their lives. ¬†When SHTF the fear is gone because they're too busy fighting. ¬†
Also, explosions do NOT create that much fire. ¬†There's a very loud very bright FLASH of explosion in the beginning and then a lot of smoke, dirt, dust, and debris.

I know I know this is sci fi, not Saving Pvt Ryan (which by far has some of the most accurate combat scenes in the history of war movies).
But who says sci fi has to be fake and silly and corny? ¬†Especially one as dark as this one.

In short, legal and law is different. For those who are interested, research it. For those who don't give a shit, shut up and pay your taxes like a good capitalist citizen!
