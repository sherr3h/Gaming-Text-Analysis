2015-06-30T23:30:19.000Z,Uv554B7YHk4,Creed - Official Trailer [HD],"This is an awesome movie. The Rocky legacy continues, but so does the Apollo Creed legacy when Apollo's son Adonis played by Michael B. Jordan seeks out Rocky to train him to fight, at first Rocky does not want anything to do with him trying to leave that life behind but he ends up warming up to the kid and becomes his trainer. Adonis goes by his mother's last name trying not to follow in his father's shadow but towards the end of the movie, he realizes that owning up to your heritage is not a bad thing. This is a great movie it has the feel and charm of the first movie and Sylvester Stallone is excellent as always and he is the only original that returns we find out that Paulie died and that Robert his son moved away. The only new major characters we meet is Adonis, Bianca played by Tessa Thompson and Pretty Ricky Conlan played by Tony Bellew who is Adonis's opponent. The acting is great, the story is great, the directing is great and the music is great. We also find out that Rocky has cancer and watching him get treatment and train Adonis in the hospital was awesome especially the part where he says that the nurse could go a couple of rounds.

I waited a film about Apollo Creed's son who starts to box and asks Rocky to train him but instead why had a movie about this Adonis Creed who is Apollo's boy who noone new about, illlegitimate son who still crow in Apollos house because Apollos widow took him from foster home and bring him home. And Apollo did have children. So this Adonis Creed is a boy from the hood and also a rich kid both. And that one scene is ridicilous where near the fight Adonis states Rocky something like ""i am boring i am boring!"" Damn.",2017-09-22T22:12:41.000Z,0

All Rocky movies were retarded and 100% fictional which only makes sense. Yet, the stupidass city of Philadelphia decided to erect a Rocky Balboa statue. Now, the filmmakes decided to continue by making another Rocky sequel called Creed, assuming Apollo Creed's son becomes a superstar just like him even though superstar athletes never have superstar kids (as even dumbass Lavar Ball is aware of)... This whole movie trailer just looks cringeworthy: you have another cornyass song by Lupe Fiasco, followed by another pretty lightskin chick because White America hates darkskin girl (I'm assuming that's Creed's girlfriend)...this thot Zoe Kravitz is in everything these days.. Really the only purpose of this movie is to glare at Michael B. Jordan's transformation as a well-built boxer... I thought Jake Gyllenhaal was more impressive since he looks like a gay guy that belongs in Brokeback Mountain.. And of course Rocky aka Sylvester Stallone has to be in it to cement the retardation process.

2015-06-30T23:30:19.000Z,Uv554B7YHk4,Creed - Official Trailer [HD],"I think the next film should be the last one. It should end with Creed becoming world heavyweight champion and Rocky dying in hospital with just Adonis there, the only one who Rocky has left. Rocky telling him that's its going to be okay when he thinks he can't win without him. Giving him the cuff link that Mickey gave him, telling him he'll be his angel.
They should have it where hes just about to go and he sees Adrian, still fairly young, kneel down beside him, mirroring the way he kneeled down beside her when she was in a coma. Shes smiling at him not saying anything, and with that, his last words simply being 'Adrian'. 
For me, that's my perfect ending. Honestly got teared up just typing this out haha.

Creed was honestly a poorly-directed cliche-ridden film. There was nothing fresh about its fresh take of the Rocky franchise.

No film and no team of actors will ever be able to recreate the magic that the original Rocky film and cast gave to us all, not in a million years. This is a good film, but its not a 'great' film and certainly not one that people will be talking about 30 years from now. How I hope they don't kill Rocky off in a similar scenario to Mickey. Personally I wish they hadn't brought the illness of cancer into the movie, it spoilt it for me. I hope were all not going to be put through seeing Rocky passing away in a deeply sad way. I almost hope they leave it to our own imagination, but I feel they won't. Some heroes should never die.............and that's the beauty of movie making......................they don't have too.",2016-05-17T18:50:09.000Z,0

I guess it failed to live up to my expectations. Maybe I would have preferred to see Rocky Junior, the story of a son that gets his family out of poverty. Have a plot where rocky Junior births a new son, and loses his wife to cancer or birth complications, while his father rocky also struggles with the same disease, and the health bills force them to sell all, and Rocky Junior is offered the fight and payout of a lifetime in a winner takes all title fight,etc...***",2016-03-27T17:34:31.000Z,0

2015-06-30T23:30:19.000Z,Uv554B7YHk4,Creed - Official Trailer [HD],"LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL what a joke let me just elaborate a little bit, near the start a fight breaks out in a youth prison non of the prison officers try break the fight instead they make room so they continue fighting what a joke, no effort to show the training of the young boxer he seemed pretty lay back through out the film, the supposedly rival punches another boxer in the face at a weigh in and breaks he's jaw and doesn't get arrested for assault where is the logic in that? one training session and he is ready to fight a 17 0 boxer, near the beginning of the film he apparently goes down to complaint about noise in the flat below there is where he meets the girl of the movie, he then decides to knock at this at this girls door and says to her you want to go out to eat, he doesn't ask hi my names etc or are you single or anything before we know the girl is in love with him how fked up is that haha, mid way through the film they have sex whilst rocky is still on the sofa haahahahahahaa, omy god i can go on and on, the bloopers in this film are fking hilarious,  to finish off this comment the end the fight is a complete joke hardly got punched on he's left side and he ends up with the worlds most closed eye like not even mike tyson would of given a eye that much of a closing even if he punched someone with he's bare fist multiple times whilst unconscious.

Conclusion of this film sorry to say Rocky has officially been raped in the cinema like what they did to the indiana jones movie, whoever said they should oscar this film has got mental issues need to seek help. what and ending to rockys legacy 

I might need to make a video to stress how bad this film was how can this be 8.0 / 10 on imdb wtf man",2016-01-22T01:46:29.000Z,0

I'm a massive Rocky fan and was really looking forward to this but the whole ambiance of the film had 20% that of the originals (mainly referring the 2,3,4). I mean the ring fight scenes were quite badly filmed and directed imo and when you compare it to the classic Drago fight, it's just different leagues (no crowd noises at all and no shots of the crowd only ring side as its all green screen).Also Stallone seemed really unenthusiastic in this film. I know he's meant act ill but generally his acting was below par and disinterested.
If I had seen it in a cinema I guess my opinion would be different. But I thought the fight scenes were completely pathetic. ",2016-01-08T11:03:13.000Z,1

If we count the films chronology of events, he has been blind in 1 eye since the 2nd film, had a brain tumour from the 5th film, and has been through a lot since he was a simple boxer in 1. Now you have CREED, a film about someone who is trying to forge their own identity as a boxer while living in the shadow of his father, his mentor and their combined past.

The only thing I don't quiet understand about the series is, why does Apollo Creed's son feel like he has something to fight for, yet Rocky Balboa's son does not? 
Of course they're 2 different people, but they're the sons of the 2 greatest fictional boxers of all time, so surely it has to be in the genes right?
I mean it's like both son's were born into wealthiness, with the Creed family being much better off financially than the Balboa family, until Rocky took the torch away from Apollo that is, won it all, lost it all again, then got some of it back with the flourishing restaurant business.
Robert never had the heart of a fighter, yet Adonis has, so it's as if Apollo Creed's son (whom I'm guessing never knew his father) can relate to Rocky (as a father figure) much more than Rocky's own son can relate to his own father.
I know I'm just making assumptions... Guess I just have to watch the movie to know what it's all about.",2015-11-15T11:37:22.000Z,0

Timeline-wise, his son would be in his late thirties. What?! Is Flyod Mayweather's old ass needing some competition?Seriously, retire already Sylvester! Damn you are looking OLD in this trailer.

Interesting twist Creed but not sure if it has the feel of a Rocky film. What's more strange is they are using cruiserwight boxer Tony Bellew as the villain. We will see if he can act or will he be himself cause he is quite vocal guy and enjoys all the trash talk and is pretty good at it. David Haye and Tyson Fury are 2 other Brit Boxers who would have been interesting for the role. Good luck Tony with the film but not with the Merseyside Derby as I'm routing on Liverpool FC to beat Everton.",2015-10-04T03:16:55.000Z,0

I thought it was high time that some Creed movies were made. Here's my beef with this trailer - rap music. I feel that the rap music utilizing the n-word cheapens what may be a great movie. But, it seems that we're going to go full-on thug with this particular movie. I'm not one to stereotype randomly - if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck... yeah, yeah. Anyways, I hope the movie is a masterpiece. We could stand to see something of the greatness the Rocky series had (minus that 5th one - pure crap). Fingers crossed.",2015-09-07T08:12:09.000Z,0

Rocky's son wasn't born until close to the end of Rocky 2 and if Apollo's son were the same one in that movie, then he'd be in his late 30's early 40's.  But this son seems to be in his 20's.  I think this is either a mistress of Apollo or Mary Anne's (Creed's wife) final child that must have happened after Rocky IV in which he never met his father.

Did Apollo go around telling his family and friends????

Or did he just tell his wife and she thought it appropriate to tell her son?

Rocky 9 is already in talks with Pauly fighting Rocky in the ring after all these years for balling his sister.

Rocky 10 script is being finalised and apparently Mick didn't die...he just fell into a coma, so they have to exhume his body and he ends up fighting Rocky in the ring for burying him alive.

Rocky 11 Dragos wife wants to avenge her husbands disgraceful loss to an italian American midget.The biggest threat is that she averages 2200lbs of pressure per square inch on the punching machine because she fights on the rag and they deny her chocolate...They even allow an opposite sex bout because by the time of its release, we will have reached true equality of the sexes.

Rocky 12 After losing his dog Butkus to a serious bout of food poisoning, Rocky says he will come out of retirement to fight the guy who sold him the tainted dog biscuits.

Rocky 13 After reviewing the fight footage....Clubber Lang declares he will come out of retirement because he realised that instead of his punches being nothing other than hooks 100% of the time, he may have a chance if he brings some unpredictability to his fight strategy.

Rocky 14 After his win, Clubber Lang is challenged by Mick for the Heavyweight belt for pushing him out of the way in Rocky 3. Rocky manages him but not after Mick punches the wall repeatedly asking if he stinks.",2015-08-12T10:46:34.000Z,0

2015-06-30T23:30:19.000Z,Uv554B7YHk4,Creed - Official Trailer [HD],"A lot of people are saying this film takes place in 2015. Now I happened to watch this trailer a lot and I found out a couple things. Apollo died in 1985. Now we can assume his wife was 1 or 2 months pregnant because they didn't tell anybody. Adonis says he never knew him. So obviously he was born after the death of Apollo. Rocky 6 was filmed in 2006  we know this because rocky still has his restaurant. Here's something intresting. In 1:36, you can clearly see Adonis wearing bred 11 highs. Bred 11s came out in 2012. So this film had to be set in 2012 or 2013. Rocky also looks older so we can assume that this film takes place in 2012 or 2013. Or Adonis had the bred 11s since release and the film was set in 2015.

Trailer : your daddy died in the ring 

Adonis: I don't know him. ...
.....
Adonis: that's pictures from the 10th round of the first fight, right? I also heard of a third fight between you two behind closed doors..

Rocky: how do you know this? 

Adonis: I'm his son 

Lol,  Wth? 
Okay, but you don't know him huh? 
your only following in his Footsteps and wearing his trunks and know his secret fight with Rocky, Creed and his family were filthy rich but you had to fight for everything in your life huh?.... get outta here, I know they will manipulate the story line some how

Stallone you are one of my favorite actors ever but this story line doesn't grab me and I'm going to have to pass...

I heard of this movie almost 2 years ago and was stoked, all kinds of different senerios but I am disappointed,

2015-06-30T23:30:19.000Z,Uv554B7YHk4,Creed - Official Trailer [HD],"Wow... this is like a ""Boxing Cinematic Universe"". This got me thinking... They could make boxing movie ""crossovers""... In boxing movies, you always follow *one* protagonist. You see him go through his life's struggles, overcome obstacles, challenge himself and eventually win the big fight. In the meantime, his opponent is *always* portrayed as a ""mean"" tough guy with no relevant backstory. But what if the opponent *had* a backstory? Equally moving as the protagonist's? What if you make *TWO* separate boxing movies. Each about a different boxer's journey and prize fights... and in each of the fighters' solo movies, you would sometimes see small hints or cameos of the *other* fighter. Then, you would have them *both* meet in the ring in a *3rd* movie.  I personally think that would be awesome. It would give the final fight tremendous importance... (kind of like what Marvel does with its superheroes but in a *realistic* boxing world).",2015-07-12T22:10:15.000Z,0

Would've made more sense since u first saw appollos children in rocky 2 running by him playing.  They look to be born in the early 70s.  This kid may have been a result of an affair Apollo had right before he died.  I hope they explain how this guy is his son.

Gone is the Ali like banter of Creed, gone is the fact that his son would have been well off, instead we are greeted with the decaying urban landscape, gone is the fact he would have lots of advantages to getting into the boxing world, replaced by the underdog story and having to be trained by people not in the fighting world. No way the son of Apollo Creed grows up an outsider and an underdog. Just an attempt to return to tropes of the boxing genre instead of giving the film any new perspective. Coogler should be able to do better than this. (Granted maybe I'm wrong, its just a trailer, but my interest is non-existence).",2015-07-08T23:21:39.000Z,0

2015-06-30T23:30:19.000Z,Uv554B7YHk4,Creed - Official Trailer [HD],"Wow, that took me off guard! I thought 'Creed' was going to be a prequel, about Apollo Creed's rise to fame before the events of 'Rocky', which is why I was surprised at how modern the setting looked. Not even the line ""your daddy died in the ring"" tipped me off since I thought it was a foreboding call-forward to Apollo's eventual fate, showing that he accepted it when he began. I wasn't expecting it to be a SEQUEL, and I CERTAINLY wasn't expecting Sylvester Stallone to show up to be junior's mentor. This feels like it really could be as awesome as 'Rocky Balboa' after all, rather than the shameless cash-in I was concerned it might be when I first heard about it.

Hey, I wonder if young Creed will ever get to fight Mason 'The Line' Dixon? That'd be neat.",2015-07-05T06:02:45.000Z,3

The very idea of this movie just wrecks movies like terminator genysis, just a sequel trying to retcon the other sequels because it didn't believe the others were good enough. This movie not only acknowledges that rocky is old now and shouldn't fight anymore (cough cough ""Rocky Balboa"") but it also shows a new character which has a good right for being introduced, Adonis Johnson which will be interesting to see how he interacts with rocky or even his dads legacy.

But actually my idea was to make a series about Apollo Creed as a pre-quel as he came up the ranks and eventually met up with Rocky Balboa in ""Rocky"". But period pieces are expensive, so the writer went with the more practical, cost-effective route, I can't say I blame them.

With the thick mustache Michael B. Jordan actually favors Carl Weathers and got eyes like him when he is shadowboxing in the corner, like he could be his son. I hope it's good like ""Rocky Balboa"" was.",2015-07-02T21:58:18.000Z,1

2015-06-30T23:30:19.000Z,Uv554B7YHk4,Creed - Official Trailer [HD],"In Britain, slavery continued to be practiced following the fall of Rome and sections of Hywel the Good's laws dealt with slaves in medieval Wales. The trade particularly picked up after the Viking invasions, with major markets at Chester and Bristol supplied by Danish, Mercian, and Welsh raiding of one another's borderlands. At the time of the Domesday Book, nearly 10% of the English population were slaves. Slavery in early medieval Europe was so common that the Roman Catholic Church repeatedly prohibited it — or at least the export of Christian slaves to non-Christian lands was prohibited at e.g. the Council of Koblenz (922), the Council of London (1102), and the Council of Armagh (1171). In 1452, Pope Nicholas V issued the papal bull Dum Diversas, granting the kings of Spain and Portugal the right to reduce any ""Saracens (antiquated term referring to Muslims), pagans and any other unbelievers"" to perpetual slavery, legitimizing the slave trade as a result of war. The approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his Romanus Pontifex bull of 1455. However, Pope Paul III forbade enslavement of the native Americans in 1537 in his papal bull Sublimus Dei. Dominican friars who arrived at the Spanish settlement at Santo Domingo strongly denounced the enslavement of the local native Americans. Along with other priests, they opposed their treatment as unjust and illegal in an audience with the Spanish king and in the subsequent royal commission.",2015-07-02T10:00:43.000Z,0

Also messed up for him to say to Stallone. (The Italians had enough time with Rocky, it's time for a new and better hero.) If he wants that! Then come up with your own story. Not bite off of Stallone's Rocky story. Only because the Copy Rights of the Rocky story is passed 20 years.

Even a dream scene with Talia Shire's ghost might make it more interesting. I wonder if Burt Young or Milo Ventimiglia will cameo in this one?",2015-07-02T00:33:15.000Z,0

Good boxing movies define what reality is for alot of boxers, but many people can relate to the lives these individuals have outside of the ring. Overcoming hard times, their struggles, their tough up bringings. Also dealing with the comedowns such as the glory, money, & fame.

2015-06-30T23:30:19.000Z,Uv554B7YHk4,Creed - Official Trailer [HD],"Ah, now picture this. Creed is a great fighter, trained by the best ever, Rocky Balboa, but he's a rich boy, he doesn't have the eye of a killer from the streets. Rocky had that naturally in the ring, but he doesn't know how to teach someone else to have the eye of a killer, he's too nice! He gets far but not yet to the top. He's still in his dads shadow. To get the eye of a snarling mad wrecking machine that just won't quit Rocky sets up a secret match behind closed doors. Creed enters the ring in a run down gym, there is no-one there. A door out of shot slams shut, Creed looks over, his face changes from anticipation to confused awe. We hear a man step into the ring, the camera pans over to where Creed is looking and reveals it to be Ivan Drago. Though much to Creeds disapproval, Rocky's plan to turn Creed from nothing more than a man living in his dad's shadow and wanting to prove that he is his dads equal into snarling mad wrecking machine that just won't quit works instantly. Now there is no stopping Creed from getting to the top and along the way, he learns to forgive Ivan which allows him to finally bury his demons. 

Yeah it's corny but it just feels so Rocky like :)",2015-07-01T16:31:57.000Z,0

En lo que a las franquicias de ROCKY de Stallone se refiere, no creo que exista una persona en todo el mundo que le gusten al 100% todas porque ha tenido muchos deslices; sin embargo en mi opinión, hoy en día y pese a 
su edad, sus péliculas siguen siendo taquilleras y ésta última entrega de Rocky no será la exepción. 

¿Quién era Stallone? Era un donnadie que se abrió el solo las puertas del éxito. 

No entiendo por qué la gran mayoría de las personas, no saben respetar y critican sin fundamentos. ¿Por qué? Porque si te gusta ver rápido y furioso 74, transformers 32, y una lista interminable de películas malas, ¿por qué criticar lo que los demás nos gusta ver?",2015-07-01T13:25:03.000Z,0

Just wait until the tv spots & more promos with the word of mouth around thanksgiving. People love the rocky series & apollo one of the most beloved characters.
