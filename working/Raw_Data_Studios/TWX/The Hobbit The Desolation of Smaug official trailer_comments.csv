2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"It's sad because all the hate the Hobbit Films get, yes they are flawed but the reason they are flawed is the real crime. With LOTR, it was Jackson and his team and all the time he needed, the Hobbit was Jackson...after Del Toro dropped out, it was Jacksons team.... with 5 studios calling for changes and the time pressure to fit a deadline set by the 5 studios.
Lindsey Ellis goes into this in detail but if The Hobbit had been all Jacksons from the start, with all the time he needed and no outside creative restrictions, we would have easily had films as good as the Rings Trilogy.",2019-08-31T16:20:22.000Z,1
2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"I really like this movie, but I wish the intro in Bree was cut, and the last 15 minutes was Smaug attacking Laketown instead of the Dwarven forge sequence.
The thin about the intro to this film is it's lazy to just dump exposition on the viewer at the start, even if they've never seen the first one. You can mostly piece it together anyway. It annoys me everytime I start watching this movie- the very next scene is a much better place to start- Bilbo peaking over the rock and seeing their pursuers. The questions a viewer would have are not a bad thing. End rant. I like the movie quite a bit, but it's odd that the beginning and the end feel tacked on.",2019-08-24T15:41:31.000Z,1

Probably the most important part of the book, as far as character development goes (which is pretty important because it's about THE HOBBIT!). But instead, we see that scene replaced with a scene of Bilbo loosing the ring and becoming all possessive and brutally killing a creature to get it back.

I expect some level of faithfulness to the source material and DoS deviated so badly from the book, it is virtually unrecognizable as Tolkien. Bilbo and Smaug's encounter is the most impressive part of this film and the most faithful. The rest is a bastardized version from the overly ambitious and pompous mind of Peter Jackson.

Face the facts, the stories don't show the pain of adult life, the temptations and conflicts that responsible adults REALLY face, nor is it realistic. But they sometimes portray intense moments that are climatic, with scenes of decision making, facing challenges, breakdown etc....so it sets a great moral and message with its literature at the end of the day. So as a young adult, despite of what I said, I LOVE IT. But if someone finds it too fantasy-like and doesn't like the films (even lotr), I doesn't disagree with you one bit. But if an adult likes it and understands it, why not? Die hard fans should not bash at ¬†people who don't find these interesting, because fantasy is too subjective, and fans are immature if they disagree with the haters of the series.

But as a film and literature maniac, I LOVED it. For its intense suspense, great morals and messages, and brilliant character portrayals, references and judgements. Great work by Tolkien and Jackson!",2014-08-01T15:18:00.000Z,0

Are you spending so many hours of your worthless life watching movies and TV that you live in a world where if a movie isn't perfect it fucking sucks?

Do you realize a direct adaptation of an old ass book would be a boring-as-fuck film?

Are you still breast feeding and trying to put square blocks into circular holes?

Peter Jackson might not have made the best of movies but damn that man for trying, his films on middle earth are a goddamned thrill ride.

I thoroughly enjoyed both Hobbit movies, and I can strongly say that anyone who dislikes these films most likely has

a) more back acne than a high school wrestling team
b) a shrine in their closet modeled after Tolkien himself
c) pages of their LOTR and Hobbit novels stuck together from their prepubescent cum.

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"So I just wanted to say that I have recently began an interest in reading The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings.
But before so, I wanted to make sure that I get a good copy that has dealt with most of the grammatical errors and stuff like that left behind by Tolkien.
I am probably going to get the 60th anniversary edition of The Lord of the Rings when it comes out this June since it will have the most up to date revising.
But as for the Hobbit. I was wondering which version is the best if anyone could let me know? Should I get the Hobbit Annotated edition? That was the one I was planning on getting, but I just want to make sure.
If you could also fill me in on the Silmarillion and Unfinished tales, that'd be great too.

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"This upsets me. With LOTR, Peter Jackson managed to squeeze all the most important things in three long, detailed books with lots of back stories into three movies: it was a great job. But The Hobbit and The Desolation of Smaug are just a embarrassing.

The first movie is basically about everyone amazingly surviving high falls and all kinds of danger - and it's not just once, but over and over again. Not to talk about this one. NOTHING is like in the books. I can't think of one scene in the whole movie that's either exaggerated with violence or completely different. For example: the elves didn't play parkour on the spiders' webs, Legolas didn't surf on one orch, nor did he jump on the dwarfes heads while shooting orchs, Bombur did NOT do his super barrel spin-attack and Thorin sure as hell didn't balance on Smaug's gap.

Let me tell you how the meeting of Smaug went in the books: Bilbo went in and took some gold to show the dwarfes and when he went back in, he awoke Smaug, who got angry and flew around the mountain trying to smash the dwarfes dead inside the tunnel - and THEN he went to Lake Town. They hid in there for several days and never even saw the dragon, so no they didn't go out to run around or light the furnaces and do they amazing stunts.¬†And oh, the love story. Of course there has to be one. Even though there wasn't one in the book.
SPOILER: they never got chased by Azog and his pack in the book, either!

My point is not to hate - I'm just mad. Peter Jackson had an amazing story and he's a good director so he COULD have done it the right way by skipping all the unnecessary action parts and stuck to the original story, because it is great already. This is disrespectful towards Tolkien.",2014-04-23T20:18:32.000Z,0

Hard to be truly immersed when what is supposed to be realistic feels like an advanced video game. The days of CGI being impressive is definitely over, cause they seem unable to take that next step, which is making the CG feel/look as it was ever in front of a camera.

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"Peter Jackson did let us down. The fact that there are a lot related writings to the Hobbit can in no way beused as a reason to justify 3 movies since the changes are for the most part completely different from the other original writings. Look .. I get that a movie director should have some leeway in changing the story .. I even like the elvish warrior lady Tauriel ‚Ä¶ but so many of the changes are simply stupid ‚Ä¶ Gandalf goes off to this mountain to meet Radagast?! Because? Did they really need to go there to decide to go to Dol Guldur? And what exactly does Gandalf hope to accomplish? In the book there was an actual battle, an attack by the forces of the White Council. Why not do just that?! It would be far cooler than Gandalf getting stuck hanging in a bird cage.
Peter Jackson has transformed the story of the Hobbit so much that it scarcely resembles the original. It is not that none of the changes do not work, many in fact do, but for every 1 that does, there are 3 others which are simply laughably stupid. And it is these stupid ones, and there are scores of these, that basically ruined the movie for me.
So Smaug is fighting 10 dwarves and 1 hobbit, all unarmed, and cannot kill a single one? So he goes to Lake Town rather than simply continue the fight with these unarmed foes? Why in the world would Smaug leave the dwarves and Bilbo in possession of the Erebor and its staggering treasure so he could make an attack on Esgaroth, a place he could attack and obliterate any time after he kills and eats the dwarves and one hobbit? There are so many of these staggering dumb plot devices like this that it is just shameful that Tolkien‚Äôs name has to be associated with this pile of golden dung. We can only hope that someday some director with a bit more class and common sense and artistic integrity, will give a far better interpretation of a classic fantasy story rather than mangling one into something absolutely pathetic. And I won‚Äôt even go into the Hanna Barbara cartoon physics that seem to operate every time the dwarves encounter foes, destroying any last vestige of dignity or parallel world Tolkien intentionally created over 6 decades of his life.
Three movies? Three movies and so many characters never are even fully developed like over half the dwarves and Beorn.
The truth is this trilogy is more about more money than anything else, and never about getting it right or otherwise Bilbo would actually be major hero in the movie rather than an afterthought.
Peter Jackson does not understand nor care about Tolkien‚Äôs work no matter how much he professes otherwise. I only wish the real JRR Tolkien were here to shred him personally into ‚Äúquivering ribbons‚Äù verbally with his razor sharp wit. See The Letters of JRR Tolkien for a sample review of Tolkien‚Äôs for a proposed movie script during his lifetime.",2014-01-04T16:50:27.000Z,0

I can't even find the words to describe it. Like, seriously. Every second something was happening. SAURON appeared! This fucking badass (I know he's a bad character but he's seriously a badass). What I really appreciate in the movie that dwarves actually fought the Dragon! This fight was one of the best Dragon fight's my eyes ever witnessed. In book they actually didn't fight him, just run around shitting their pants. Here? Fuck they were badass as hell, so many shit happening while fighting, their ideas while fighting were God damn surprising. And the Dragon looked so fantastic... They also added other stuff from Tolkien's stories to this movie and changed the story a little bit, but in my honest opinion they did great job. The necromancer and creating an army of orcs, Gandalf trapped in the castle, Legolas in the city on the lake. All the time I watched this movie on the edge of my seat. Ten times better than the first one, every aspect of the movie was epic.

I almost didn't because the movie theaters where I live are freezing in winter, but I am glad I didn't let that stop me. I just know when I'll watch it on DVD the impact of Smaugs voice wont be the same. When he roared and started speaking I felt it in my bones. It was breathtaking, I could feel his power. I love dragons and this is in my opinion the best movie/television dragon I have ever seen. He left me in awe.

But then the Dwarves came in and it all went south.

The Dwarves, who's main skill up until that point is being repeatedly defeated and captured, were somehow able to avoid Smaug, the chief calamity. Smaug brags about being able to smell dwarves but moments later he strolls right by them without noticing, Thorin literally stands on Smaug's nose and lives. Smaug, who committed dwarven genocide and destroyed an entire city, can't seem to catch a few dwarves withing reach and the 'furnace with wings' seems to constantly forget he can breath fire. Then Thorin surfs a shield down a molten river and remains unharmed and stands on a huge golden statue that for some reasons burst into a river and drowns Smaug. Smaug lost all sense of wonder and power.

I wish all of what I wrote was a bad joke, but it's not. Peter Jackson really did give us Smaug the Stupendous ... and then quickly gave us Smaug the Incompetent. A true disappointment.",2013-12-27T16:13:05.000Z,20

I'm Gandalf the grey!

Hello Bilbo how ya doin' today?
Ohh nothing Gandalf. Just doing this and that.
Tell me boy. Do you want to give me a blow.
What?!
Oh come on, you don't even have to get on you' knees boy.

Why does Gandalf go to the quest for Smaug?
Because he wants to RIDE the dragon. If you know what I mean.

These jokes are under my ""horror"" comedies. You know. Because they are really HORRIFYING. If you know what I mean... :P

Biological procreation will soon be unnecessary. Its concomitant sexual dimorphism is no longer advantageous to human survival. In fact, it is almost irrelevant. The bodies and minds of men and women are now ill-suited for companionship and cooperation. The human/machine hybridization has already begun, seeking an existence devoted to intellectual and physical experience, and to recreation and refinement. There is only one biological and social form that is ideally suited for these pursuits. It is a form that was, ironically, considered to be a puzzling, yet reoccurring genetic mutation, and frequently dismissed as being aberrant: the gay male.

If the film had been done completely accurately to the book then instead of the exciting and amazing barrel scene it would have just been a short scene of the Dwarves locked into barrels going down a river. Also Legolas and Tauriel actually fit in really well considering neither of them were in the book (even though Legolas would have been there as Tolkien stated)
Basically the majority of (shitty) critic reviews seemed just like rants on how it isn't accurate to the book and how it isn't as dark as TLOTR, despite scenes such as where Legolas hammered an Orcs head into a beam slowly chipping bits of his skull away.
All in all I loved the book and I loved the film, mainly because I didn't go into the film looking for flaws like so many others have done.Ôªø",2013-12-22T22:15:13.000Z,229

And I'm looking very forward to the next part of this brilliant trilogy. ",2013-12-21T21:35:54.000Z,1

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"Never been so let down as when I saw this. Love all the ''this is perfect!''.. ''this is amazing!!'..you can tell they haven't even read the bloody book! Oh dear what have they done to the Hobbit!! *may have spoilers*

really was looking forward to the character 'Beorn' (one of my ¬†favourites) with a course thick black beard, big, strong very blunt and direct, confident and someone the enemy very much fears for good reason.. fantastic character in the story.
:this passage from the book..¬†

''Standing near was a huge man with a thick black beard and hair, and great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles. He was clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was leaning on a large axe.''

so how on earth in the film did the text translate to a feeble uncharismatic tall skinny werewolf thing?!?!..and that's his human form?!?! if it wasn't for the ¬£10 ticket and all the peoples hard work making the film who had no influence over the story/character design I think I could of quire easily left! just felt infuriated!¬†

20% of the book is based in an incredibly evil wood named 'Merkwood' with great adventures, fear, strange creatures and working as a team to overcome hunger and problems solving getting across vast rivers that bring us closer to the characters such as great empathy towards Bombur¬†..days where lost in this dim, dark and very creepy places found within this very strange wood and what happened to the dwarfs ¬†getting poisoned??¬†

In the film the characters walk around a wood like there tripping on bloody mushrooms for 10 minutes then it's all over? The small woodland path where Frodo has his first encounter with a ringwraith in 'the fellowship' has more Mirkwood qualities then this one! ¬†¬†

the props such as Dale and so forth where very well done in the film and Smaug looks stunning but they have changed so much of the story? characters and all the very needed rich beautiful details? In this you're left with something that dose not even come close to the book! I'm all up for slight changes for film adaptation but this has gone far to much with vast plot holes that are explained in the book but go unanswered in the film? seems like all efforts are going to smaug and the climax for the battle of the five armies and there skimping on the rest! great for family entertainment, or people that are easily impressed by mindless action and matte paintings. The real shame about this is that the story has very diverse characters¬†and depth but has not even been touched on. This is a classic story for a reason, I fear after seeing giant great statues of gold and huge barrel battle sequence with elves and orcs that the next generation will be disappointed at there disappearance in the book as this was all fictitious on the part of the film.. but there again the sort that are just interested in the 'bigger is better' rather then a good solid and fascinating storytelling with characters that will invoke fear, love, admiration, anger along with many other emotions will not be interested¬†in the real story to begin with. ¬† ¬† ¬†

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"¬†IMHO there's a couple of problems with the Hobbit Trilogy.
1)¬† These movies need an intermission.¬† I mean, the first film was nearly three hours long.¬† It would have been nice to have a ten minute break to stretch the legs, grab a smoke, refill the popcorn.
2) The references to Sauron.¬† Anyone who has seen LOTR already knows where this is leading so the suspense factor just isn't there.
That being said, The Hobbit is a worthy companion to LOTR.¬† Jackson outdid himself by not only telling of Bilbo's journey but cramming in everything Middle Earth into what could have been a single movie and I'm glad he did.",2013-12-15T15:32:26.000Z,0

Characters that are dead and have nothing to do with Thorin (Azog), Thorin turned from a dwarf king into a dwarf sized human in his thirties, people who have nothing to do with the story (Legolas) or just plain don't exist (elf chick).

I don't think he'll be a fire engine red dragon, but I have faith that once we see him in his full glory he will undoubtedly be red and/or golden.",2013-09-20T03:09:29.000Z,0

mythological dragons such as smaug obviously have bodies built to properly sustain itself with his fire breathing. same as how the human body is built to sustain itself with what it is capable of. 
this story doesn't take place on earth, if you looked at any middle earth map you could easily tell its not the planet we live on so obviously the laws of physics don't apply there the exact same way they do here.

Any creature that can breathe fire would have died of lung cancer from the amount of smoke it conjures in it's mouth and lungs, but Smaug has lived for over a century.

A creature Smaug's size would be unable to dwell on Earth. It would simply be crushed by it's own weight and die.

Gandalf -  Has no reason to run off

In LOTR (films) have you noticed the incredible mines of moria? They were built by dwarves and overrun by goblins, why?
Also, why does Gimli initially shouts at Legolas ""You can't trust an elf!!!"". Ever noticed that? That's the answer to your greedy/power question.

I've already established that.  The most valuable piece of commodity currency they found was the arkenstone, which is why Thorin wanted it so badly.  In the films, Thrain used it to justify his power by taking it ""as a sign, a sign that his right to rule was divine.""  This gave it great symbolic meaning above that of instrumental value.

In LOTR (films) have you noticed the incredible mines of moria? They were built by dwarves and overrun by goblins, why?
Also, why does Gimli initially shouts at Legolas ""You can't trust an elf!!!"". Ever noticed that? That's the answer to your greedy/power question.
If you wish look it up and find out, it's awesome and pure Tolkien (not Peter Jackson, though).

I've already established that.  The most valuable piece of commodity currency they found was the arkenstone, which is why Thorin wanted it so badly.  In the films, Thrain used it to justify his power by taking it ""as a sign, a sign that his right to rule was divine.""  This gave it great symbolic meaning above that of instrumental value.  In that regard, in the books, the dwarves are MORE GREEDY than in the films.",2013-08-25T07:05:08.000Z,0

PJ took some of the scholarly additions that made those books so brilliant and added what he thought would make em so appealing to a wider audience and he succeeded in LOTR not in the Hobbit.

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"Basically. It's a pretty short book to establish real characters for all thirteen dwarves, plus Bilbo, Gandalf, and a host of others on the side. In the book you really get to know Thorin, but that's actually about it. You know that Fili and Kili are the youngest and rashest, that Bombur's the fat one, that Balin is kind. Other than that they're just names filling up a roster. It's lovely what the movie has done to make them real individuals.",2013-07-20T23:26:01.000Z,0

I mean the whole storyline there was you had the prior generation i.e Thranduil (Legolas' father) and Gloin (Gimli's father) stuck in an intense racial prejudice that was almost generational but by LOTR you saw the emergence of a new generation of elves and dwarves who experienced none of that prejudice and have a more color blind view if you will thus birthing the friendship of Legolas and Gimli. ,2013-07-20T16:52:06.000Z,0

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],I have to disagree. Yes the LOTR movies worked with just one movie each but the Hobbit has a lot of scenes that are important and really need to be focused on. Even with good writing and scripting it would still be kind of upsetting to condense the hobbit. I was thrilled to see so many themes from the book being shown. And of course you are entitled to your opinion but I am just saying that there are a lot of us who prefer it in two movies for the sake of showing as much of the book as possible,2013-07-08T22:12:59.000Z,0

The reason why it ""looks"" worse or not as good is because in LOTR and movies made between the 2000 - 2005 (around here) the CGI blended well in films. The technology today with the digital cameras are more advanced and picks up HD in greater detail so it is difficult to now blend CGI with what's real.",2013-07-06T11:52:14.000Z,0

Reads a bit like a history book but I'm slowly making my way through it. And if you're a serious fan of Tolkien and his work I would highly reccommend reading it.,2013-06-28T04:51:13.000Z,0

Peter Jackson said right at the beginning of production that he wanted to create a new visual experience, and he did, with the 48fps and the new contrast in colour. I like the vibrant new world, dont ruin ur experience with the hobbit movies because ur comparing it with lotr, remember that story was set in a darker, crueler middle earth. It is only fitting that the hobbit be brighter and light hearted",2013-06-19T01:48:34.000Z,0

But we know that he is Elvenking's son.  The Hobbit was written first, and LOTR expanded the story. Because the Elvenking actually has a name now. Or do you just want them to call him ""the Elvenking"" like in the book?

It's just a trailer. PJ will have the invisibility ring effect in the film.

The wargs evidently talk to each other and are able to converse with goblins but you can't have them talk plainly and still obtain the same level realism you get with the wargs in LOTR.

There is no concrete evidence for Legolas' age. ""2030"" is a made up number which New Line published.

He is certainly a mature elf, though, in the Two Towers he makes two references to his age, one in Fangorn forest and one at Meduseld in Edoras. But in terms of other Elves in the series, he's far from ancient.",2013-06-17T15:06:40.000Z,0

1) It's a children's tale about leaving the shire, finding bravery, and fighting a dragon. It's an adventure. LOTR was an epic quest that was more adult oriented and the threat was much greater than Smaug the Dragon. 

2) The Lord of the Ring took 3 thick books to get over with, and a lot of things were left out, whereas the hobbit took 1 slightly thick book, and things are being added. ",2013-06-15T20:19:02.000Z,0

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"I disagree. I think it was a good decision.

1) At The Battle of the 5 Armies, there needs to be a clear differentiation in motivation between the goblins and the wargs. Having the wargs fight the battle simply because ""their leader was killed"" is a bit weak from a movie standpoint. They also need an instigator, aka Azog.
2) The dwarves needs pushing from behind to keep the danger levels high and the story flowing.
3) Azog adds weight to Thorin's mentality and motivation.",2013-06-15T14:37:59.000Z,0

Yeah, maybe because this was new during WWII. Of course writing has evolved. Publishing is easier, ideas flow faster, and competition is fiercer. Compared to the stuff of today, Tolkien is bare. It did, however, lay a foundation for the fantasy genre. Modern writers build off of what he did and the tropes he created. Give the man some credit. ",2013-06-15T04:39:05.000Z,0

However, according to the appendices at the end of LOTR, Aragorn was 87 when he met with the hobbits in FOTR and ruled as king 122 years before passing away. So, even taking into account the extended lifetime, it wouldn't make sense for him to appear in the Hobbit because he'd be too young.",2013-06-14T17:32:38.000Z,0

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],I think he will be in it for a fair chunk seeing as The Hobbit was written before LOTR so his character wasn't even created at the time of writing. The same goes for Thranduil because he was always just called the Elvenking in the book. Not until LOTR did we hear Thranduil was the Elvenking's name. So I guess Jackson is taking liberties with putting Legolas in this movie as he would have most likely been in the events of the Hobbit but was just never mentioned.,2013-06-14T10:49:54.000Z,0

The job of a film maker is not to take your reading experience and stick it onto the screen verbatim: cinema and literature are fundamentally different mediums. Jackson's task is to make the Hobbit movies mesh in scope, tone and world-building with the LotR movies, and to compliment them; the books are tonally VERY different, both in scope and in world-building. I was dubious as hell about the Hobbit movie(s), but I think he ended up doing a very good job with a difficult task.",2013-06-14T07:25:24.000Z,0

There are a lot of different storylines going on but I think the movies stay true to my first impression (when I read the book at age 9).

It was an amazing movie and it served it's purpose. And that purpose was to set up the next two and get things started and introduce characters and story lines. An Unexpected Journey was literally a 2hr 49 min 26 sec movie trailer. It was MEANT to be more of a light film vs a darker one. The cast have had interviews stated it was meant to be like that because movies 2 and 3 get very dark.,2013-06-13T22:41:13.000Z,0

NO - he eliminated and merged characters on his whims, like his stated goal of making the story more 'women' friendly by expanding Arwen's role then turning Elrond, perhaps the noblest character in the story, into a prick for expediency- he BUTCHERED! a classic and continues to do so..",2013-06-13T21:22:49.000Z,0

Also they have to take into account the value of every actor is playing each character. Besides Peter Jackson said that he has some writings from Tolkien that he never managed to publish and never seen light until now, maybe that's why the movies are going in a different direction.",2013-06-13T16:02:47.000Z,0

As far as pacing goes, the hobbit is famous for it's ""2 weeks went by..."" moments, where huge narrative is ignored that Peter can elaborate on. A perfect example will be the battle of the 5 armies. In the book, the armies assembling and Bolg approaching is a small paragraph, whereas in the movie this could easily inhabit 10 minutes of eye candy! ",2013-06-13T10:26:10.000Z,0

Yes he has added in a side plot with the white Orc but he has helped depict Tolkein's world in all of its glory. The Hobbit is a rimless classic but a difficult thing to portray in a movie because quite frankly there isn't enough nail biting events. It's unfortunate that he has altered the story, but without those alterations all the movie would be is a short action scenery",2013-06-12T21:20:35.000Z,0

The dragon looks weak--especially his eyes. The book said his eyes shown like lamps or lanterns, lighting up areas of the cavern floor. There's no external illumination going on here, at all.

Get your facts straight before speaking. First of all, you yourself have probably never read The Hobbit, Secondly it was in fact written as a Fantasy Novel and  childrens' book.

You are a great parent if you let your child read The Hobbit as it is an easy read and creates a huge imagination.

I heard that the third one will not just have the Battle of Five Armies, but Peter Jackson is incorporating some history from between the end of the war to the arrival of Gandalf in Hobbiton for Bilbo's party. I heard he was going to bridge The Hobbit with LOTR. I think that will be pretty cool. ",2013-06-12T17:23:40.000Z,0

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],I agree putting Legolas in may be a little overkill (his female companion is way to overkill) but it is just to add in some excitement for the people who didn't read the books. I feel Peter Jackson really strayed away from the book in The Hobbit and he added things (again for people who didn't read the books) that solely were meant to put more entertainment towards the movie. I really hope that Peter Jackson doesn't stray away with the Battle of the Five Armies otherwise I'll be extremely upset.,2013-06-12T16:41:32.000Z,0

Especially from FotR, which was more inaccurate to the book than An Unexpected Journey. By making it 3 movies, he doesn't have to cut so much out of the story.",2013-06-12T14:52:26.000Z,0

2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"Actually, you are not fully correct. The only plot point really being added from other books is Gandalf's adventure. What he means, and he is somewhat correct, is that characters such as Legolas do not belong in this story. However, as a film, it is easier for the audience to connect with Legolas, and also more interesting, because we already know him. So no, he is not ""dumb as fuck.""",2013-06-12T07:17:31.000Z,0
2013-06-11T17:13:19.000Z,fnaojlfdUbs,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug - Official Teaser Trailer [HD],"Out of ALL the books ""the Hobbit"" is probably the primary example of something that needs to be beefed up for film. Even Tolkien wanted to go back and re-work the Hobbit in order to achieve a more consistent serious tone with the LotR novels. It's smart that the Hobbit will be divided in 2 movies, and the third film being comprised of material from the Silmarillion and RotK appendices to better flow into the trilogy.",2013-06-12T07:17:00.000Z,0

Plus, Thranduil (spelling?) is his father, so it makes sense that he could make an appearance. As does the more in-depth storyline with the Necromancer, if they're connecting the story more with Lord of the Rings, he's kind of an important detail.

As for Smaug, he's covered in shadow, I don't see how you can judge the CG by the trailer. I'm sure when they show more detail, he'll look better.",2013-06-12T06:19:05.000Z,0

The painted sets look fake but it's really not the set designers fault.

So much of what's wrong with the first film is still present here. As for Smaug... not very compelling or scary.
