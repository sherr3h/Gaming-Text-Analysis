2010-11-18T17:32:50.000Z,_axLoYlwwmU,The Green Lantern | OFFICIAL trailer #1 US (2011),"I like to know who was the person who dropped the screenplay of this movie (now considered one of the worst movies of the 2010's) off at Blake Lively‚Äôs doorstep...because that person made the worst mistake of their life (just as the person who dropped off the script of ‚ÄúDaredevil‚Äù for Jennifer Garner). 
The individual should of had delivered the script to ‚ÄúCrazy Stupid Love‚Äù instead (and in return given the script of ‚ÄúGreen Lantern‚Äù to Emma Stone; can you believe she co-stared with Reynolds in ""Paperman""?), because Lively does not fit in as Carol, and with ‚ÄúCrazy Stupid Love‚Äù it would of not only re-team Blake Lively with Julianne Moore (they were in ‚ÄúThe Private Lives of Pippa Lee‚Äù) but come face to face that with the person that I feel would had tamed and loved Lively a lot more: Ryan Gosling* (I have a feeling he and Jason Lee are Reynolds).
This is nothing new: Several years ago, my sister Ashley (who has the same crazy-like-a-fox mentality as Lively) was in a relationship with a dark haired guy named Kyle and my Mom (who had kicked her out of her house a few years prior), liked him and thought my sister had turned a new leaf. Well, you can guess what happened: She broke up with him after a while and even today, my mother still believes he was the person my sister could of married.
Well, there you go: The ultimate ‚ÄòWhat If‚Äô do-over in the corrupt, nasty playground known as Hollywood (or is ‚ÄúHow Weird‚Äù?).

DC has more High Concepts than say...Marvel or Wildstorm mainly because they are more in touch with the roots of comics.

But seriously, don't try to dumb down the medium. DC has variety, that's how comics like 52 get created. There's something for everyone. ",2011-05-05T01:22:17.000Z,0

I forgot, I assume it belongs to some TV production house, anyone know?

I think DC's current stance on race in terms of the Green Lantern franchise can be seen in the big push John Stewart has been given in the cartoons over the last few years. It's been so successful that some people around here think he's the original GL!
I don't know anyone working for either company though so you seem better armed with info than me. Could you share some stories or examples?
Message me privately if you feel uncomfortable putting it up on here...

Sinestro is in the film. You see him (I guess on Oa) at about 1:30...
The film is pretty much Year One for Hal so Sinestro should be in the Corps and training Hal. My guess is he turns in the sequel.

I don't really think of DC or Marvel as particularly racist. They had some terrible moments in the past and took far too long to stop calling Black characters 'Black (Insert rest of name here) but that is more reflecting wider social issues than the companies being racist right?",2010-11-20T00:57:47.000Z,0

The original Golden Age Green Lantern was Alan Scott and he was white.
The original Silver Age Green Lantern was Hal Jordan (the one played by Ryan Reynolds in this film) and he was white.
