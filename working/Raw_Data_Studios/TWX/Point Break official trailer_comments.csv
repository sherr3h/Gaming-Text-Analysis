The director of the film said in a interview that he didn't want to make this film becouse the original is so good. But he came with an idea of making a film with authentic stunt's with real life people and no green-screen shooting with a different plot then the original Point Break. If you have seen the movie you should give it some more respect since these ppl risked their lifes during shooting. We all got different opinions about the movie.

2015-05-26T23:00:01.000Z,ncvFAm4kYCo,Point Break - Official Trailer [HD],"This makes for a pretty cool trailer, too bad the movie sucked, everything that Point Break (1991) got right, the 2015 version veered around or screwed up, one of the main differences is the original had a natural flowing plot that encompassed the extreme athlete stuff into the story, it made sense, the new movie is basically just the 4 or 5 big stunt scenes and they awkwardly try to fit a story in between. I think they would have at least saved face a bit if the movie was more of a reboot/sequel titled something like Point Break All Or Nothing or Point Break Proving Grounds or Point Break II anything but Point Break because with that name they set the bar too high, too many expectations and too many chances to fuck it up, which they did. Don't get me wrong, the movie is watchable but it ain't rewatchable over the years like the original.

I think I've enjoyed watching it some 20 times since I was in my teens hungry for powder rides with my snowboard, both in my own language and in english.
Not seen it yet and I'm curious though. I think I'll give it a try.

A big difference I can already sense: Bodhi never meant to kill nor harm anyone in the original one. The tragic shooting in the end is what destroys his dream actually. What's gone wrong in the last 25 years? I still can't swallow the amount of violence that seems to mark the american society and culture nowadays.

I was still deeply disappointed. This movie is full of amazing images and scenery (even though you can find better looking and more impressive footage of wing suits guys here on YouTube), but without anything close to a decent script. It's not only completely unrealistic, it's also stupid and deprived of basic logic. Oh plus the acting is really bad, apart from two actors, √âdgar Ramir√©z and Ray Winstone.
The basic idea of the movie it actually cool, so I believe it could have been a really good and entertaining movie, if the acting where good, the script was good etc.

The Good - The action and stunt scenes are incredible and well thought of.

The Bad - Everything else. The dialogue is very cheap with the original being much better. The story itself seems to take in part the first movie but adds incoherent elements that is just really unbelievable. I think other than the actor who played Bodi, the rest of the actors were really sub par.

Another plot, a few things MAYBE the same, but the name is only used again because the original movie was such a classic and famous movie, they'll hope it'll get more people to the movies.
What isn't true if I read the comments, it'll only angry the people who loved the original and it won't say anything to the people who haven't watch the original :P",2015-12-12T23:06:31.000Z,0

Rule 1: Only films that were shitty the first time out because of low box office and bad production values, but still had good scripts, get a second shot. ¬†

Rule 2: If the the actors from the original film are still alive, you don't remake the film - Period - and that means the entire cast!! ¬†

Rule 3: Remakes should be confined to only ONE remake - Not like Carrie; I think they're up to 5 and Sissy Spacek is still alive!¬†

Rule 4: Any film that has ever been referred to as a ""Classic"" doesn't get remade! ¬†The word ""Classic"" when applied to particular film it should be equivalent to a structure that gets a ""Historical Landmark"" status, which means it can never get knocked down. ¬†""Classic: means it never gets done over!

And finally......¬†

Rule 5: Foreign films, in most cases, should be OK to remake unless the particular foreign film was huge in the states and developed a huge fan base as a result of its popularity. ¬†

That's it! ¬†5 rules and the understanding that any film that falls into any of these categories, is automatically exempt from remake!",2015-08-05T04:48:28.000Z,0

Although I haven't seen it (obviously) so I really don't know how it is. It could be an amazing movie or it could be the next Troll 2.
However, no surfing, no ""Ex Presidents"", no Bell's Beach, and no straight up bank robbery makes this look like more of an Ocean's 11 type movie, where they do the impossible instead of that gritty, true-to-life violence and FBI vs criminal masterminds. 
Again, I haven't seen it so I'll try and tread lightly but as far as I'm concerned, they have destroyed the name of my all time favorite movie. After anticipating this ""remake"" to come out for 3 long years, disappointed is a serious understatement.

0:04 If that's actually an ancient proverb, than I'm Johnny Utah.
0:08 Maybe I could take this trailer more seriously if they didn't use color-correction in a more heavy-handed and obvious fashion than a first-year film student who just discovered iMovie.
0:21 Is ""Jumping out of planes and cutting ropes"" really that unusual a skill set? I can do at least one, and I could probably do the other if you paid me enough. ¬†Or if you shoved a block of money out of the plane and told me to- Oh, wait.
0:29 So they changed the setting, character motivations, and the police agency, all presumably in an effort to promote gritty realism. ¬†And then they screw it all up by keeping the main character named ""Johnny Utah.""
0:30 Why did Joseph Gordon-Levitt dye his hair red, and start calling himself ""Luke Bracey?"" ¬†And why is he lowering himself to this, for that matter? ¬†He was in The Dark Knight Rises and Looper, for God's sake.
0:30 And for another matter, why did they even need to re-cast the role? ¬†Keanu Reeves hasn't aged a day since the '90s. ¬†Maybe the producers are just afraid he's a vampire?
0:53 ""How do we disrupt the international financial markets?"" ""Why, we jump out of planes, of course!""
0:58 Remember when Michael Myers only killed seven people, Rambo only killed someone by accident, and Point Break's villains didn't kill anyone until like three-quarters into the movie?
1:04 ¬†And they call me Johnny Utah, apparently. ¬†Why does this movie exist, again?
1:09 I'm just gonna come out and say it: I think I actually would have enjoyed the old Point Break more if they had spent the whole time re-enacting Tom Cruise's first scene in MI:2 instead of surfing.
1:15 Speaking of which: Hey, look, surfing! Remember when that was half the movie?
1:56 Man, those masks suck. ¬†Don't remakes usually at least have BETTER production values than the originals?
2:17 ""You jumped out of a plane without a parachute? Well, we'll, um, jump off a waterfall. ¬†Way cooler.""

2015-05-26T23:00:01.000Z,ncvFAm4kYCo,Point Break - Official Trailer [HD],"Im surprised there are so many dislikes just over the fact that its a remake. The original movie was made in 1991, 24 years ago. If it was such a great movie then I would expect people to be thrilled at the prospect of a new one. Until I read the comments I hadn't known it was a remake, which is one positive of that fact, it brings new attention back to the original. Like the original Tron, True Grit, & Oceans 11 among others they were all great in their own right but would've died out with their generation in this day until they were remade. I don't think they're remaking this to say it was bad or to dis Keanu Reaves & Patrick Swayze, but rather to bring back an awesome movie of its time to the new and younger generation that hadn't heard of it, and to also to add in special fx and stunts that weren't possible to do/make at the time of the original film.",2015-06-08T17:13:58.000Z,0

2015-05-26T23:00:01.000Z,ncvFAm4kYCo,Point Break - Official Trailer [HD],"Don't worry, This will just be another forgotten remake.  What it will do is bring awareness and ongoing appreciation for the original.  Point Break was released in the late summer of 1991 after James Cameron's T2 (He executive produced Point Break) filled with realistically shot surf action alongside a dramatic storyline that pits two men from different backgrounds against a back drop of respect, friendship, loyalty determination and the search for spiritual glory in a world that has lost its inner drive and passion for the ultimate ride.  Everybody who is along for the ride do so at their peril.  All these elements will be lacking or shot wide of the mark.  The original was a perfect movie of its time (the early 90's) where the name ""extreme"" was the name of a post glam rock, metal band.",2015-05-29T19:44:47.000Z,0
2015-05-26T23:00:01.000Z,ncvFAm4kYCo,Point Break - Official Trailer [HD],"To all the haters here. I am a huge original Point Break fan. I have seen it in theater about 5 times and about 100 times on the small screen since 1991. I love the original and nothing will replace it.  However I'm looking on the positive side 100% about this remake. The guys in it including the main actors and stunt athletes that are ¬†involved are all ¬†hard core point break fans as far as I ¬†researched. Regardless of Hollywood money remake etc, I think this movie is going to be insane if you just sat back enjoyed and relived the point break spirit in it. I personally can't wait to see it and I think it is going to be a very thrilling and emotional experience for those who feel the connection to the Point Break Spirit.

Ok, Point Break might not be what most consider a classic, but give it some credit: It wasn't THIS. This wouldn't stand on it's own merit, so why call it a remake? Why involve other IP when you can't even get this right? By the way: Where the fuck are they? Utah is FBI, operates on US soil, but the gang is going all over the world. Isn't that Interpol or CIA territory? Before anyone tells me they changed his job, uh: ""FBI is going to teach me to surf?"" Is one of the most quoted lines of the original.

Also, what plane full of money is flying over third world countries? Do you know how rare it is to transport cash via plane? Let alone over the effing jungle.¬†

God, the whole cast looks like a bunch of GAP rejects, none have any kind of personality or even unique looks about them, and Utah is an extreme athlete from the start.... why? The whole damn point was that he was a squeaky clean guy put undercover and torn between two lives. Can't really be torn if you start off where the bad guys are. Also since when did the gang kill??? The reason why they weren't labeled terrorists with shoot on sight orders was because no one gets hurt! They were just bank robbers and were good at it.¬†

2015-05-26T23:00:01.000Z,ncvFAm4kYCo,Point Break - Official Trailer [HD],"This actually looks kinda cool, I really cannot deny all the elements found here that I truly want from an action film, the guns, the cars, the locations, the chases, those cinematic big climactic moments ect. but what bothers me about this remake is that it is based on a movie that heavly influenced the Fast and Furious movies with the whole straight'n arrow guy who looks cool enough to fit into the cool crowd and successfully go under cover into an extreme world of surfing [street racing] and now [everything?] where they check your coolness level at the door, except now instead of going back to it's roots, it looks like just another film being heavly influenced by the Fast and Furious movies with a dash of original Point Break and not the other way around. It almost seems like someone didn't do their homework however it's not that I expect they are actually going to make a tamer, minimal special f/x, realistic cop movie like those from the early 90's, it only makes sense for it to be bigger and badder in scope, otherwise what's the point right? This is the first remake that I have seen that I could be like one of those ""ahh they ruined the whole thing"" guys cuz I do love the original so damn much but to be honest, it's not like I am expecting them to re-do something that is as good as Point Break because essentially, it is so damn great because it is a gem of it's time, it's got young Keanu who's name is friggin Johnny Utah, young Swayzee who's name is friggin Bodhizafa and a hilarious Busey who likes lemonade with two meatball sandwhichs, that's right two! It really was cool defined for that time, it had the usual banks heists, car chases and fist fights but it also had beach football at night, a crazy and experimental for the time footchase that seemed too surreal and a cocky lead with a 90's generation attitude that gladly threw it in the face of his old timer superiors who no noubt were sickened by the younger demographic, which was highly accurate of the time. A classic film of it's day to say the least. The point is, they are not going to remake Point Break in anyway that fully satisfies fans of the original but I can enjoy this movie cause it really does look pretty bad ass on it's own, remake or not and I know no matter how much they stray from the path of the original, it's still a nod to that amazing film.

Before you whine/complain about hollywoods originality remember how many original movies that you watched this year alone....now how many of those were successful? *Ends Rant* :D,2015-05-28T08:00:06.000Z,1

Point break was about Brohdi's expression of freedom from the oppressed society and the payback was robbing banks with influential past Presidents. He was making a statement which in one of the robbery scenes , he tells the people , don't worry your money is insured. Basically it had nothing to do with the common people, his beef was with the government. The surfing was his outlet , he was free when he surfed and when the money ran out , they went and robbed banks to stick it to powers that be and lived their lives of freedom with the governments money. Plot !!!!¬† add Johnny Utah as a former star quarterback that could've went pro if he didnt blow he knee out. Now he's an young FBI agent partnered with a veteran agent Nick Nolte. add the love intrest and the admiration of Brohdi , learning how to surf because they figured whoever was robbing banks was living the surf guy lifestyle. He falls in love with the chick and actually sets himself free from all the surfing. Basically liberating himself from the fact that his football career was over. Done.

Knowing her son would follow in his fathers dark foot steps she fled LA to raise her son in a safe environment...But genes can't be changed. The son grows up to be an action sports legend. Always feeling as if something is missing he is disgruntled about where he comes from. His mother finally tells her son where he comes from (the legendary surfer bank robbing hero) and gives the son a footlocker full of all of his dads personal items. Hidden inside the baseboard of the footlocker is a list of all his old crews names, occupations, and locations. The bank robbery thing was just a small part of something HUGE...Taking down the global financial infrastructure. As he digs deeper into the world his father lived in he finds out Bodhi's former crew has now established themselves as an international crime syndicate. In an effort to clear his fathers name the son teams up with Johnny Utah (who is now a quite relaxed surfer type living off the grid in Australia.) Johnny of course finds the son first just by watching him surf ""The RIGHT"" in an effortless bodacious fashion. Johnny approaches the son to find out this is Bodies KID!!! LIKE WHOOOAA!!! Now he is torn between his new found quite lifestyle and working with Bodhi's son to take down the old crew (of course Johnny feels he owes Bodhi and he may find some self redemption for helping Bodies son).

Having said that, it may still be a good film but only because of the extreme sports they portray. My initial thoughts on the new Bodhi is that he is¬†some kind of modern day Robin Hood with a¬†God awful accent. Talking of God awful accents, WTF is Ray Winstone doing trying to do some kind of Bogart drawl. I think that is really going to grind on me if it's too prevalent throughout. I don't really get the ' he's interrupting the international financial markets' whilst obviously creaming shed loads to fund his endless summer. Seems like a contradiction right there but I could be wrong. Although my initial thoughts are of disappointment I'm still secretly hoping they've done¬†the original some¬†justice somewhere throughout.

THE FANS DON'T WANT THAT

Not to mention the fact the original point break was all to do with surfing not extreme sports in general. Point break is a surfing term not a general term for use with any shit you can think to add to make money. I don't deny the film could be a good one but calling it point break is an instant ruiner.

2015-05-26T23:00:01.000Z,ncvFAm4kYCo,Point Break - Official Trailer [HD],"When I find out a remake of any film has released the first trailer, I get excited to see what intellectual comments will be left on here. This one is just as golden as any other I've seen.

We get it, ""remakes are evil"" - ""remakes ruin childhoods"".

No.

Remakes bring an old idea and brings them up to date and opens it up to a wider audience to make more money for the business behind the film. That's right kids - 99% of movies are created to make money for a company. They don't care that you don't like how a film looks. They don't care that most people commenting hate on these trailers won't go and see the film. They don't care that you think they have ""ruined your childhood"" - that notion itself its ridiculous, how does a ""bad"" remake do anything other than make you appreciate the original more than you already did!? Surely you should THANK the release of bad remakes!!!

Anyway. The solution here is simple - don't go and see the movie.¬†

I LOVE the original Point Break and I will probably see this when it comes out to buy or VOD etc. I even enjoyed the Robocop remake AND the TMNT remake!! That's because I'm mature enough to ignore nostalgia and not be a sheep and not follow the vocal minority of the internet! Take every single film ever made as it's own thing. Don't watch it with a mental side by side comparison and you will open your mind to enjoying more films than you would have before.",2015-05-27T09:58:19.000Z,0

There is no way anyone working on this, for example, could admit that it would be good or even a halfway decent idea. They don't care. It is all about the money. And even if it tanks at the box office, they've already made their kesh.

The budget seems decently high, but Point Break wasn't about a big budget. The marketing campaign has begun, and it is going to be strong, but Point Break didn't have a crazy marketing campaign. It wasn't any of those things.

Point Break was a different movie, from a different time. The 'little guy' in the summer of Terminator 2, Point Break stood strong, and means so much to the people of its generation because of the way it made us feel. Mark Isham's RIDICULOUS score. A last third that literally caused your adrenaline level to rise from just watching a screen. A newcomer who had the looks, energy, and charisma. A more seasoned lead, who effortlessly became Bodhi on screen. We all wanted to freefall, surf gigantic waves, and come into our own--in a way we weren't supposed to--when we saw it.

THAT was Point Break.

Guy 2 ¬†- ""Lets make the characters say really stupid shit the whole movie like, ""the only law that matters is gravity""""
Guy 1 - ""Wow. Brilliant stuff.""
Guy 2 - ""finally, lets make sure to get some really mediocre actors to take the places of the greats from the original""

2015-05-26T23:00:01.000Z,ncvFAm4kYCo,Point Break - Official Trailer [HD],"It looks like it has the elements of a fun movie. The action looks real and stunning (who knows how it'll look in the actual movie with the 3D), the cinematography looks gorgeous, the acting is descent, and the dialogue sounds cheezy but at the same time naturally fun. HOWEVER, based off of the trailer, this is NOT POINT BREAK. Like what you said, if this was a sequel to the original film, then I would accept this. Secondly, I have NO problems with a remake changing things from the original and/or adding new things that hadn't previously existed, even if the original was good. Finally, I wouldn't mind taking some of the same themes, plot and dialogue from the original all the while bringing/adding new things in the mix like updating the robbers to make them not just surfers, but extreme sports athletes AND Robin Hood-like anti-hero figures as well. But, the main problem with the movie so far is the opposite problem with the recent POLTERGEIST remake. While the POLTERGEIST remake was just a rehash of the original except with bigger/modern effects and some changes/alterations here and there with characters and story elements/lines, this looks nothing like the original in terms of tone, characters, and dialogue except for character names and the basic storyline that it just comes to a point where it just seems to bare only the title and character names just so the people who are familiar and nostalgic with the original can go see the new one and make lots of money at the box office for the studio. I'm still curious to see this film and how it turns out. Like any movie, I want this to be good. It has a descent director, writer, cast and crew who seem passionate about this and can tell that they are putting their heart and soul into it. It may as well be a descent action film, but it's relation to the original thus far has made me cautiously skeptical and wondering, just like everyone else, what is the point of this if you are just going to change almost EVERYTHING from the original except for the title and character names like I said?

This is going to be a remake that could be its own film and is just using Point Break as a way to make the film look less generic. I'm gonna guess that the people who made this film had little consideration for what made point break good, and want a quick cash in. Also to say that complaining about remakes because people are stuck in the past is kinda dumb, this movie was made to attempt to leech off of the success that the original film had, so it should be judged against the original.",2015-05-27T01:16:23.000Z,1
