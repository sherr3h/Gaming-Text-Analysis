2016-03-22T22:32:03.000Z,GQR5zsLHbYw,The Nice Guys - Main Trailer [HD],"""The Nice Guys"" was one of the better movies of 2016 that I have seen. It's funny, it's original, and it's straight up entertaining. The humor is quirky, but it is funny. The movie is set in the 1970's, and feels very much like the 1970's, not only is the movie funny, and sort of mysterious, but the lighting, the tone, and the soundtrack are all truly 1970's. This movie is full of grooviness and funkiness. I love seeing Ryan Gosling's range in acting. This dude is so talented. He's been a different type of character and has played the roles well in movies I enjoy, and it was cool, and funny to see him play this role in a quirky humor role that I've never seen him portray, which was really interesting, and funny. I'm going to give, ""The Nice Guys"" 8.2/10 stars. üë®üë®üèºüçªüåÅüî´üî´üíºüîçüé•üé¨üéµ",2017-08-02T07:32:52.000Z,0

2016-03-22T22:32:03.000Z,GQR5zsLHbYw,The Nice Guys - Main Trailer [HD],"Just saw this at the cinema, Lethal Weapon this AIN'T.

Don't be fooled, it's barely funny at all, the action and plot suck, they try to make a humorous situation of a 13 year old girl referencing anal, and also putting her in many other situations that if I were the girl's father I would have absolutely banned her from making this movie. Some Hollywood sicko probably has her on the casting couch.

Compared to a truly great buddy cop movie like Lethal Weapon 1, this is an absolute shambles of a movie with nasty undertones to it. It also drags on and on and on, at least 25 minutes too long for how thin the plot and action are.

I don't often love a movie and to be honest usually I am pretty harsh on them but this is a great film. It's not the best film ever made or anything but it's flawless for what it's trying to be which is a stupid noir buddy cop comedy! When I say ""stupid"" I am referring to the good kind of stupid. This movie was interesting, had a great plot, great characters, fantastic script, and even really good film making as a bonus!!! 9.5/10

2016-03-22T22:32:03.000Z,GQR5zsLHbYw,The Nice Guys - Main Trailer [HD],"I have been doing a little research project this month. I have had extra time as compared to a normal human being who works. And so to kill time, I have been going to a lot of movies. I have been going to an inordinate amount of movies, more movies than an average human being. Naturally, the first thing I did was watch the movies I really wanted to see based on the previews that I had witnessed. I saw Deadpool which I thought was amazing, then I went to see Zootopia, which was the best movie of the year so far. But, then I started watching movies I wouldn't normally go see. I went to see 10 Cloverfield Lane, which was just ok, and then I saw Risen, which I had mistaken for a movie about Roman soldiers. I was right but also very wrong and the movie wasn't that good anyways. I also saw a movie with one of my favorite actors, George Clooney, however that movie ended up being HIS worst. Then I got really bored and went to see movies I didn't even want to see.   I went to see The Witch, which was bad, and finally dragged myself into the atrocity of a film The Divergent Series: Allegiant, which made me surprised, because I hadn't killed myself before its credits.

My science experiment was that I made a mental note of the feeling the picture gave me just from the previews. The experiment proved that the preview is a very good indicator on whether a movie is going to be good or bad.  I raved about the preview for Deadpool and Zootopia which turned out to be fantastic, and turned my nose up for The Divergent Series: Allegiant which turned out to be a disaster. I had a similar spectrum of feelings for all the movies in the middle. I did not go see The Gods of Egypt. That movie preview was so bad, I decided that I would rather sit in a dark room and listen to grass grow. As it turns out the people who made that film are either fired, broke or both. Maybe they should pick up my hobby.

My point is that The Nice Guys  has got my attention. The preview has made me get the inkling that I am really going to enjoy it. Is it the aging Crowe or the young rising Gosling? Maybe it is the setting or the plot, or a combination of the two? I don't know why I am going to enjoy The Nice Guys, but I would be willing to put money down that I will love it.  I think that a lot of people will agree with me that WB has got this trailer right, and so the movie must be right as well. 

I have never seen so many movies in a short amount of time. I pity you people over in Hollywood. I once thought there was great glamour in the movie business. However the reality of it is that there is a lot of junk to sift through. I am happy that the previews allows us to avoid movies that aren't worth a 2D matinee. I also want to thank the industry for making that fact blatantly obvious. 

We will see how my nose fairs for the next month. So far I have smelled a stinky ghost, shook my head at a mothers day movie that smells like an old ""friends"" sock, and wondered why Tommy Lee Jones is suddenly mute.
