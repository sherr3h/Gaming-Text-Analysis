There is just 1 thing they got wrong  in the beginning of this movie Forks , Table Forks 
didn't exist until the 1700s . Only Spoons & Knives were used before then . People ate with their hands a lot. what we now call a Big bar-b-q fork was the closest thing to the table fork that existed before the smaller table fork was invented .Realize when they were new only the wealthy had them. the middle and lower classes didn't have access to what we now call the table fork till the late 1700s -early 1800s By Then  they had  begun inventing several different kinds of table forks each meant for eating different kinds of foods . there were even Separate  lunch and dinner forks , dinner forks being larger .",2017-01-26T08:02:08.000Z,0

I love the scenes were they just talk, make jokes, fight, it makes them feel real.
In the second one their travel becomes more and more dark, and the third one finishes with one big 30 minutes long war, that tights all together, this trilogy was made, from the beginning, as one large movie, divides in tree.
I can say I love this movies, not as much as TLOTR trilogy, wish is more mature, but people, go read the books again, all of them.

The Hobbit book: For Kids (But also for open mind adults)
The Hobbit movie: For Kids (But also for open mind adults)

TLOTR books: (For adults)
TLOTR movies: (For adults)

The tone of The Hobbit trilogy is just right, when you see it in retrospective.
I'll gladly make my future kids watch this movies in their young years, they are full of healthy fun, jokes, action, but also drama, sadness, danger, love, loss, etc.

It's the whole package people!  ",2015-02-05T01:19:57.000Z,51

The next two movies will be more action. It is sort of like the fellowship of the rings in that the end of it feels a little rushed but it had more emotional impact.

The eagles find it dishonourable to work like a taxi, it's in fact to be getting used. Would you drive me across the earth if i asked you? They got their own kingdom and borders to defend, all evil is their enemy.
In the book they just happend to see the obstacle and saved them, Gandalf didn't summon them as he appears to do in the films.

Lots of stuff will happen before reaching TLM, espc in mirkwood.

Why the hell they would put Azog in the movie? Azog died 142 years before the Adventure to lonely mountain. Some Dwarves looked like men and elves and they didn't even have beards, Thorin is the worst!! He should have grey beard, because he was oldest of the dwarves and the only dwarf (except Balin) who has ever been in Erebor. It was horrible movie!!! About 70% of the film was made up by PJ.

Bilbo was lot less annoying then the damsel in distress Frodo, witch he was not in the books by the way. he was more like Bilbo. i was never bored. i loved Thorin, who was more like king then Aragorn. this movie has the handicap of high expetations and huge outrage over 3 parts. while think this movie should be done in 2 parts. i loved this movie so much that if others are like this, i will happily watch them.

Thorin is the one who tells the tale of the mountain. second thing i would change is 1. no hammering about Nercomancer/Sauron. they should tell it was reason why they cant go around the woods, but beond that, we should even forget that its sauron. great movie in all and all.

Look at the Star Wars prequels. I know I'm going over well-tread territory, but they are good examples. Those films bombed with critics, but more importantly with fans.

It's too big a story to capture in one film, or even several.
The book is told like a historical account rather than one story, which wouldn't work on film.
And the biggest obstacle: Christopher Tolkien still holds the rights to The Silmarillion. So unless he has a change of heart or his sons sell the rights after he dies, we won't be seeing a Silmarillion movie.",2012-11-09T22:59:23.000Z,0

Seeing how he wanted to cover as much detail as possible with The Hobbit, he decided to put some of these characters back into it to better tie-in with what he originally created.  For example, Radagast makes an appearance in the LotR books but is only mentioned in The Hobbit.

2012-09-19T14:59:08.000Z,SDnYMbYB-nU,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Official Trailer 2 [HD],"LOTR is one of the best trilogies ever made, I agree completely. It was monumental for its time. What I meant was that now, 10 years later, after LOTR opened the door, we've seen our full share of huge epic films. So, in that regard, ""The Hobbit"" just can't fill LOTR's shoes - it's just a different day and age and it would be unfair to expect another LOTR. ",2012-10-03T13:27:30.000Z,0

2012-09-19T14:59:08.000Z,SDnYMbYB-nU,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Official Trailer 2 [HD],"Well, the book ""The Hobbit"" is considerably more light-hearted than the LOTR books, so to a certain extent that is unavoidable. I don't believe that this is going to be a cheap comedy and from what I've seen in the trailers I'm pretty sure that the film is going to be darker - or at least more serious in tone - than the book. 

What it won't be is another monumental piece like LOTR. It's just that the times are different and these films are not as special anymore as they were 10 years ago.",2012-10-03T12:29:23.000Z,0

It sounds like the movie is long enough to break it into 3 different movies to be released each year. Then the LOTR stories would take over in the timeline.

Also saying that The Hobbit is a prequel is not entirely correct. By definition a prequel is a story created after another story in the same universe but set to an earlier time. However since the Hobbit was written years before the LOTR then it is not correct to call it a prequel by that definition. However I can understand you thinking it was a prequel because the movie is just now being made while the LOTR was made years ago,2012-09-24T22:43:42.000Z,0

Darwin's theory is based on the idea that species evolve from adapting to their environment over time.  A problem with the idea of this leading to evolution is that adaptation reduces the amount of genetic information--members of the species that don't survive as well die off and their genes are not passed on. So evolution should lead to a narrower diversity of species, not the wide variety we have today.",2012-09-24T03:58:05.000Z,0

It looks like they used Alan Lee artwork as source material for backgrounds and scenic views. Just looks amazing. In many ways, the Hobbit is a better overall self-contained story/adventure than LOTR. Should make for an amazing movie. ",2012-09-21T14:15:17.000Z,0

And I know how long the journey of the Ring took. But that's irrelevant. The topic's the time gap between events before that journey.

Look, let's just drop this. Clearly we're not gonna see eye to eye. In my knowledge the Ring keeps from aging, therefore Bilbo should've been played by someone as old as Ian was in LotR. That's all I ever wished to say.",2012-09-20T11:38:25.000Z,0

But the intro where Galadriel explains the history of the Ring and it's travels, it shows when Bilbo picks it up, and he is just as old as he is in his 111th birthday( ring keeping ages and stuff) But, in The Hobit,  he picks up the ring much much younger than in the LOTR trilogy.

Gollum had the ring for over 500 years, yet Bilbo had it for only 60.  Look at his transformation at the beginning of ROTK if you think that the Ring doesn't change it's possessor.  In the LOTR movies, it was 60 years on from The Hobbit, so why should Bilbo look as old as Ian Holm did in LOTR when he was actually Frodo's age during the events of this film??",2012-09-19T18:22:27.000Z,0

2012-09-19T14:59:08.000Z,SDnYMbYB-nU,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Official Trailer 2 [HD],"But the point is that the Ring stops physical aging of the person who possesses it while the person has it. Gollum's looks changed because of his lifestyle, not because of the Ring. Bilbo shouldn't look any younger than he does in the LotR movies, not to mention this much younger.",2012-09-19T18:18:18.000Z,0

I think it's  a good idea defiantly because this will be viewed as more of a prequel to the Lord of the Rings movies and it explains a little of how the necromancer/sauron ended up in mordor  =p !  ,2012-09-19T18:14:18.000Z,0
2012-09-19T14:59:08.000Z,SDnYMbYB-nU,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Official Trailer 2 [HD],"Actually, that is Dol Guldor, the fortress Sauron was staying in the Watchfull Peace, it lies in Southern Mirkwood. And Gandalf and The White Counsel are going to assault it, and you will probably see that happen. Also, you will probably see Gandalf in Dol Guldor (secretly) receiving the map of Dale from a dead Thráin.",2012-09-19T18:08:25.000Z,0

That's what changed his looks that way.

So for all I know the Ring DOES stop aging, Gandalf said literally: ""You haven't aged a day."" Hs studying gaze and wondering tone made it come off it wasn't just an empty compliment but actually the case.",2012-09-19T18:01:35.000Z,0
