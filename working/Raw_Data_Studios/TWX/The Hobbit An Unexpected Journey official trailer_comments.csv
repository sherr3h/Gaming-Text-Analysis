I love the scenes were they just talk, make jokes, fight, it makes them feel real.
In the second one their travel becomes more and more dark, and the third one finishes with one big 30 minutes long war, that tights all together, this trilogy was made, from the beginning, as one large movie, divides in tree.
I can say I love this movies, not as much as TLOTR trilogy, wish is more mature, but people, go read the books again, all of them.

The Hobbit book: For Kids (But also for open mind adults)
The Hobbit movie: For Kids (But also for open mind adults)

TLOTR books: (For adults)
TLOTR movies: (For adults)

The tone of The Hobbit trilogy is just right, when you see it in retrospective.
I'll gladly make my future kids watch this movies in their young years, they are full of healthy fun, jokes, action, but also drama, sadness, danger, love, loss, etc.

It's the whole package people! ¬†",2015-02-05T01:19:57.000Z,51

The next two movies will be more action. It is sort of like the fellowship of the rings in that the end of it feels a little rushed but it had more emotional impact.

The eagles find it dishonourable to work like a taxi, it's in fact to be getting used. Would you drive me across the earth if i asked you? They got their own kingdom and borders to defend, all evil is their enemy.
In the book they just happend to see the obstacle and saved them, Gandalf didn't summon them as he appears to do in the films.

That means that whomever contracted the animal acts was not good at the job of hiring! Just sickening! Yet this movie will make millions.

(2) He says ""we eats it"" ... meaning Gollum will eat Bilbo.  Gollum was not particularly choosy about what he ate ... it says in ""The Hobbit"" that he often would eat goblins that strayed.  And it is strongly implied in LOTR that he would steal human babies from their cradles and eat them ... and also that he had tried to eat the dead in the marshes near Mordor.",2012-11-21T12:59:36.000Z,0

It's too big a story to capture in one film, or even several.
The book is told like a historical account rather than one story, which wouldn't work on film.
And the biggest obstacle: Christopher Tolkien still holds the rights to The Silmarillion. So unless he has a change of heart or his sons sell the rights after he dies, we won't be seeing a Silmarillion movie.",2012-11-09T22:59:23.000Z,0

What I meant was that now, 10 years later, after LOTR opened the door, we've seen our full share of huge epic films. So, in that regard, ""The Hobbit"" just can't fill LOTR's shoes - it's just a different day and age and it would be unfair to expect another LOTR. ",2012-10-03T13:27:30.000Z,0

I don't believe that this is going to be a cheap comedy and from what I've seen in the trailers I'm pretty sure that the film is going to be darker - or at least more serious in tone - than the book. 

What it won't be is another monumental piece like LOTR. It's just that the times are different and these films are not as special anymore as they were 10 years ago.",2012-10-03T12:29:23.000Z,0

It is longer, and less easy to read through than The Hobbit, but very enjoyable. The mixed response for it is probably due to it's nature, much like a bible it feels like a collection of stories that span a good number of years and jumps between many characters, so there is no constant world to keep things safe or comfortable.

It is an incredible read for those interested in learning more about the gaps of history in middle earth.",2012-09-30T05:43:38.000Z,0

Also saying that The Hobbit is a prequel is not entirely correct. By definition a prequel is a story created after another story in the same universe but set to an earlier time. However since the Hobbit was written years before the LOTR then it is not correct to call it a prequel by that definition. However I can understand you thinking it was a prequel because the movie is just now being made while the LOTR was made years ago,2012-09-24T22:43:42.000Z,0

2012-09-19T14:59:08.000Z,SDnYMbYB-nU,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Official Trailer 2 [HD],"Very few people understand the love I have for the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy. Few people realize the respect I have for the greatness that is Tolkien's books. He created a world that has captured my imagination for 10 years now. Everytime I see Return of the King, I get a little teary. I wish I would have seen the first three movies in theaters. Sadly, I was introduced to the series a little late. But I will be at the midnight release for this. I will relive my childhood. LONG LIVE LOTR",2012-09-24T20:36:34.000Z,0

(The Ring's magic kept his appearence from aging.)

And it was just a remark amongst positive things I said. Why do people start whining if someone doesn't adore but just likes something, and chooses to point out good and bad things about it? People really need to learn that intellectual discussion doesn't come with ""OMG SO PERFECT!!11""",2012-09-24T20:23:18.000Z,0

mnt.cvz.me      its a fake movie site, after a 20s preview which doesn't show anything to verify what movie it is that your watching, after 20s your forced to give email information and even then does not let you watch the movie.  Thumbs up to save you some time from some fake ass shit.

Darwin's theory is based on the idea that species evolve from adapting to their environment over time.  A problem with the idea of this leading to evolution is that adaptation reduces the amount of genetic information--members of the species that don't survive as well die off and their genes are not passed on. So evolution should lead to a narrower diversity of species, not the wide variety we have today.",2012-09-24T03:58:05.000Z,0

Gollum had the ring for over 500 years, yet Bilbo had it for only 60.  Look at his transformation at the beginning of ROTK if you think that the Ring doesn't change it's possessor.  In the LOTR movies, it was 60 years on from The Hobbit, so why should Bilbo look as old as Ian Holm did in LOTR when he was actually Frodo's age during the events of this film??",2012-09-19T18:22:27.000Z,0

2012-09-19T14:59:08.000Z,SDnYMbYB-nU,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Official Trailer 2 [HD],"But the point is that the Ring stops physical aging of the person who possesses it while the person has it. Gollum's looks changed because of his lifestyle, not because of the Ring. Bilbo shouldn't look any younger than he does in the LotR movies, not to mention this much younger.",2012-09-19T18:18:18.000Z,0

I think it's  a good idea defiantly because this will be viewed as more of a prequel to the Lord of the Rings movies and it explains a little of how the necromancer/sauron ended up in mordor  =p !  ,2012-09-19T18:14:18.000Z,0
2012-09-19T14:59:08.000Z,SDnYMbYB-nU,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Official Trailer 2 [HD],"Actually, that is Dol Guldor, the fortress Sauron was staying in the Watchfull Peace, it lies in Southern Mirkwood.

That's what changed his looks that way.

So for all I know the Ring DOES stop aging, Gandalf said literally: ""You haven't aged a day."" Hs studying gaze and wondering tone made it come off it wasn't just an empty compliment but actually the case.",2012-09-19T18:01:35.000Z,0

He's never explicitly mentioned(because Tolkien wrote the Hobbit before LOTR) but it is very reasonable to have him there in the movie (It  would actually be rather strange if he wasn't).

The only thing that distracts a little is, not Bilbo's actor being different, but that he looks so much younger than Ian does in LotR. I mean, he wasn't supposed to have physically aged one day since this adventure but clearly he'd have if this Bilbo is supposed to be the same from LotR. :D",2012-09-19T17:10:14.000Z,0
