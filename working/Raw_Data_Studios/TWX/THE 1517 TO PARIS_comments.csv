They all have minimum acting skills at a tedious level. I think if the casting were at a professional level this movie would have been a pretty good Eastwood film.

It had a really bad script, it was poorly directed and the acting was just so very cringy. A perfect example why not to get the actual people to play themselves, since that rarely works out.

2017-12-13T14:12:41.000Z,IC_lnyn2R2Q,THE 15:17 TO PARIS - Official Trailer [HD],"‚ÄûDie mithin bewusste Plumpheit des Films r√§umt die Sicht frei auf Dinge, die man sonst bei Eastwood so gern √ºbersieht. Wenn kein souver√§ner Tom Hanks wie in Sully und keine packend inszenierten Schusswechsel wie in American Sniper den Blick verstellen, bemerkt man die v√∂llige Einengung der Perspektive auf die drei glorreichen Amerikaner: Sie retten hier mehreren Hunderten von passiven und offenbar charakterlosen Europ√§ern ""den Arsch"". Der Attent√§ter bleibt dagegen eine Leerstelle. Von ihm zeigt Eastwood lange nur den R√ºcken, den Rucksack, die Beine oder die H√§nde; sein Gesicht bleibt bis zum Schluss v√∂llig undefiniert. F√ºr dessen Motive oder dessen Hintergrund interessiert sich der Film allzu demonstrativ nicht. Nein, Eastwood kommt es auf die ungebrochen-m√§nnliche Haltung seiner drei Haupthelden an, die offenbar das Schicksal und eine entsprechende uramerikanische Erziehung hierher gebracht haben. Was zun√§chst einfach ein unoriginelles Drehbuch zu sein schien, bekommt einen unangenehm didaktischen Unterton: Wenn man Jungs nur fr√ºh genug mit Waffen spielen l√§sst und nicht auf Lehrerinnen eingeht, die mehr Konzentration im Unterricht fordern (was der Film mit Medikamentierung gegen ADS gleichsetzt), dann zieht man wahre Helden heran.‚Äú",2018-04-17T06:52:45.000Z,0

It wasn't a long movie, about 90 minutes, but I thought it was a decent movie. I remember hearing about the incident but was a little fuzzy on details, so I was glad to see the action as it really happened. I think perhaps one of the reasons for the low box-office/reviews is that there is a slight religious undertone to the story--and that can turn a lot of people off. Many years ago that wouldn't have been an issue in Hollywood, but it is now. That's just my opinion. Anyway, I don't feel as though I wasted my money.",2018-03-25T11:19:52.000Z,0

That movie was indeed also a good movie so i was fine with it. Now we see an american running at a man with a gun thats not wearing a t-shirt. We also see him watching over a city speaking about how life pushes him towards a greater purpose. Cmon man, that's a bunch of crap. If you want to tell a real story, tell a real story, if u want action make a good plot but don't bring such events directly into it. Anyways, thats what i think at least.",2018-03-04T17:27:53.000Z,0

Too bad it doesn't feature the appropriate narrative, like a certain ironically pro-ethnostate, pro-wall, pro-nationalism movie. Too bad it's directed by an undesirable. Too bad it portrays Christianity in a positive light. Too bad it portrays a real-life black hero that helped saved hundreds of lives; I guess he's not Woke-kanda enough. 

The movie was pretty good given the artistic direction Heston went with. No, the acting from the three leads isn't good. It's not supposed to be. They're not actors. Complaining about this is like complaining about an indie art house movie that's black and white and silent; that's the point of the movie, not a weakness. It's a very unique piece of art; instead of the heroes telling us their story, they show it to us. It's amazing how they acted out their lives up to that point, and re-lived that moment.

We had not been to see a movie since ""Sully."" This kind of heroism is what kids need to see, not the robots, vampires, machine guns, explosions, and car chases of violent fantasies. These three wonderful young men show the example that each of us CAN make a difference no matter what our background. They were not the smartest nor the best students growing up, but they had loving, Christian mothers who formed their inner cores. Clint Eastwood had the insight to see that he could not duplicate the bond that these three have by using actors. Well worth seeing this great tribute to real heroism.",2018-02-18T23:27:56.000Z,1

The Muslim‚Äôs intention was to kill as many people as possible but American passengers Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler and Alex Skarlatos disarmed and tied up the terrorist then they saved the life of the man he had shot.

The rest of the movie is them just being late for class all the time and having pointless conversations about shit whilst they travel around places. And it‚Äôs a bit confusing at times in the way that new characters will appear and then all of a sudden they‚Äôll just go and there‚Äôs no context to where they went or anything.

I don't know what Eastwood was thinking. It's so heavy handed, yet manages to be nothing at all. The title characters actually do quite well, it's clear they received excellent direction. But there is so little substance to the movie that the constant prodding at our emotions feels like wartime or anti-drug propaganda. Without telling us why this movie tells us how we should feel. It actually takes away from the story of these men, turns them into action heroes rather than ordinary people tasked with doing extraordinary things. Someone should have pulled the plug.

2017-12-13T14:12:41.000Z,IC_lnyn2R2Q,THE 15:17 TO PARIS - Official Trailer [HD],"As Hollywood Tries to Stop New Patriotic Movie, Clint Eastwood Gives Them Brutal Surprise

 


 

Clint Eastwood‚Äôs new movie, ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris,‚Äù is based on true events, where three American heroes stopped a terrorist on a Paris train in 2015, and it is causing the Hollywood crowd to go nuts.  They just tried to put the kibosh on certain scenes that didn‚Äôt fit their liberal agenda, and boy, that made Eastwood mad.  So, the famous actor and director who voted for President Donald Trump just slapped the leftists hard with a brutal surprise.  You‚Äôre going to love it.

 

Clint Eastwood is an American icon and is probably the most famous conservative actor and director in Hollywood.  Eastwood‚Äôs legendary work affords him the ability to pick and chose what type of movies he‚Äôll make, and he loves making patriotic American movies.

 

His current film, ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris,‚Äù is in the final edits, but the Hollywood crowd hates it, and they tried to stop certain people from seeing it.  The reason is the pro-American message it sends, described in this synopsis on Google:  ‚ÄúIn the early evening of August 21, 2015, the world watched in stunned silence as the media reported a thwarted terrorist attack on Thalys train #9364 bound for Paris‚Äîan attempt prevented by three courageous young Americans traveling through Europe.‚Äù

 

The summary adds, ‚ÄúThroughout the harrowing ordeal, their friendship never wavers, making it their greatest weapon and allowing them to save the lives of the more than 500 passengers on board.  The heroic trio is comprised of Anthony Sadler, Oregon National Guardsman Alek Skarlatos, and U.S. Air Force Airman First Class Spencer Stone, who play themselves in the film.‚Äù

 

The movie stirs real patriotic emotion and honors the three American heroes who have military backgrounds.  It shows an Islamic terrorist, who gains entry into France as a migrant, attempting to slaughter 500 people, with three Americans stopping him.  This just isn‚Äôt the type of movie the Hollywood crowd makes, and they tried to screw Eastwood by giving it an ‚ÄúR‚Äù rating.

 

The reason they gave for the ‚ÄúR‚Äù rating was it showed ‚Äúviolence,‚Äù and this pissed off Clint Eastwood, who is making this film so teens could also see a movie with real American values.  It was a cheap shot by the liberal Hollywood idiots, and Eastwood decided that wasn‚Äôt going to happen.  The legendary star shocked the Hollywood crowd by taking on the rating board himself, something that never happens.  And, not only did he take them on, he blew them away.

 

‚ÄúClint Eastwood has won an appeal to overturn the R rating originally assigned to his upcoming film, The 15:17 to Paris.  Instead, it will be rated PG-13.  According to a source, the R rating was given for the train attack scene at the center of the film, which the Classification and Rating Administration described as ‚Äòa sequence of violence and bloody images,‚Äô‚Äù reported Hollywood Reporter.

 

They added, ‚ÄúThe Classification and Rating Appeals Board says it reviews 800 to 900 films each year, with fewer than 12 ratings a year appealed.  Eastwood represented his own film on behalf of Warner Bros., which opens the film in theaters on Feb. 9.‚Äù

 

Clint doesn‚Äôt just play a ‚Äútough guy‚Äù in his movies, he showed those Hollywood snakes that he really is a tough guy who won‚Äôt be pushed around.  He‚Äôll make any darn movie he wants to make, and they won‚Äôt stop him from making sure as many Americans as possible can see it.

 

Here‚Äôs the highly awaited trailer for ‚ÄúThe 15:17 to Paris‚Äù that just came out:

 

  click here:   https://www.youtube.co m/watch?v=IC_lnyn2R2Q

 

In case you‚Äôre wondering how much the Hollywood crowd detests this movie for its pro-American military theme along with its anti-Islam, anti-migrant message, here‚Äôs how one Hollywood critic describes it:

 

But in the hands of someone like Eastwood, this [movie] reads like a recruitment ad for the military.  Nothing diminishes the heroism of these three men, but in Eastwood‚Äôs hands, it looks like he‚Äôs coasting on their achievements to tell a story that will make some people think that they too can be heroes if they just head down to their local recruitment office.  [Source: Collider]

 

Well, let the haters hate.  They loathe patriotism and they despise middle-class working Americans who love this country.  They can‚Äôt stand Clint Eastwood who said that former President Barack Obama is ‚Äúthe greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.‚Äù

 

Lastly, what in the hell is wrong with sending the message to teens that they too can be heroes?  What is wrong with giving some kids the idea that joining the military is a heroic thing to do?  This is exactly the kind of movie our young people need to see in today‚Äôs world that is filled with idiot celebrities pushing anti-American messages.  If this movie inspires just one young American to join the military and make their life worthwhile, then Clint Eastwood‚Äôs film will be a resounding success.

Probabilities?

Average guy in USA doesn t even quotes 2 countries from south america , and you think 2 GIs will visit a spot  that even frenchs doesn t give a shit?!!!!???

Probabilities : 1%.






-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 Gis found a ""suspect"" arabic people.

Probability?

A ""suspect"" arabic , isn t it????
What kind of clues you have???
How you can separate shaddy  arabic people from a ""good one""???
This hypothesis just makes no sens.

Probabilities : 10% ( admitting one of the GIs read all Sherlock Holmes books).



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2GIs and one terrorist , lost in the same place in France , in a little town completely unknown , at the same time...

Probability?

In France , you can find arabics peoples absolutely everywhere.

But you find GIs only in Toulon facilities , when the Nimitz aircraft carrier take a rest.

So , the probabilities are very low..............

I give you 15% , cause i am not callous.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gis and terrorist in the SAME wagon.

Probability?

Well , often , you have 10 wagons in the train , so i could say 10%.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Terrorist raises his weapon , push the trigger and...........................the gun is blocked??????????!!!!!!!!!!

Probability?

I guess one percent . (and i m nice) 




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Probability that the single blocked weapon of the  box  was choosen by the naughty guy  of this fairy tale?

Jesus .....0.5% and i m VERY  tolerant.





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK , now the probabilities of ALL this situations happen in  the same time , at the  same place ?

2017-12-13T14:12:41.000Z,IC_lnyn2R2Q,THE 15:17 TO PARIS - Official Trailer [HD],"christ. This trailer got shoved in my face by youtube every 5-10 min it's so annoying. 

The only movie I've seen from clint eastwood is Gran Torino and that movie was hot garbage. This looks boring too. 

blah blah blah im so great im so important im so inspiring. Self-importance seems to be a theme in clint eastwood's movie. Gran Torino too he's like ""the savior"" of the weak and defenseless asain people. give me a break.. kinda what happens when you play so many heroic roles I guess. I respect him as an actor but not as a director

also, who gives a shit if the actors are the actual people? The point of movies (unless in document/actual footage types) is that it's all make believe to sell a message. It honestly doesn't matter at all and in fact, it makes it even weirder cus then it's like ""oh yeah im so great. I'll star in the movie that reminds people im so great"" imagine someone made a movie about how great trump is and they star trump himself. regardless of your political view, that would look so cocky. Like burns staring as burns in his own movie to glorify himself. 

Another thing is the performance might suffer. Take Gran Torino for example. The hmong people or whatever werent even actors and this one kid's acting was so shit it took me out of the movie. There's a dramatic scene where clint locks up this kid and the kid screams clint's name while banging the door. Go look it up. it's hilariously bad. That hmong blood sure helped the movie! Honestly, no one gives a shit if he's actually hmong or if a peson like walt actually existed. If ""they starred real people"" is what gets your movie remembered, then it's a bad movie.

I get it you people love clint eastwood. I like him too. just not the movie he directs

Also, what the fuck. i hate these movies where you already know this one major scene is coming up and the entire fucking movie is in an anticipation of that one scene. what's the point. 

I already know what the movie wants to say. i know what it's about. so by the end of the movie i wouldn't have learned anything new than how great this guy is. So boring. I watch documentaries for that and they're much more honest about what happened and cut the bullshit about melodramatic scenes in their life.

2017-12-13T14:12:41.000Z,IC_lnyn2R2Q,THE 15:17 TO PARIS - Official Trailer [HD],"How do they plan to make this interesting?  Reading what ACTUALLY happened, one guy wrestled with the gunman and fell on the floor.  A middle aged Frenchman tried to wrestle the rifle away and the gunman shot him in the neck with a pistol.  The gunman's rifle jammed and that's when the three Americans jumped him.  One got cut up with a box cutter (almost got his thumb severed) but the others beat the gunman unconscious.

Not discrediting the heroic actions of the people involved, but essentially the guys rushed someone with a box cutter; the rifle jammed and the pistol was only used on the first guy, so in all it sounds like one shot was fired.  I know they didn't KNOW the rifle would jam but how do you convey drama on the screen?  It'd be like ""The gunman swings the gun towards the three young protagonists who's lives we've been following this whole movie...the gun jams and a beating ensues!!!""",2018-01-26T16:33:46.000Z,0

We get Aquaman.!!!! 

What is wrong with them!!!!! All their other movies are given so much time to be finished.the directors work is not interfered with. And suddenly, during DC movies, they throw shit at their own house!!!
