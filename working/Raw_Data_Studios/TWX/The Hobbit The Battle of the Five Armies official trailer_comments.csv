I like the Hobbit trilogy and the LOTR trilogy for different reasons. The LOTR trilogy is a masterclass. The Hobbit was something that simply became too stretched, but still had plenty of heart behind it, despite the obvious motives for making it a trilogy.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"This movie is absolutely horrible. Now, vast majority of the people that have seen this did not read the book, but I did, and you wanna know how long this section of the book was? SIX PAGES, out of a 200 page book. I don't even know why Sauron was in this, he wasn't in the book at all, they made thorin look way more evil than he was, there was no romance between the elves- strike that, the elves didn't have a story at all in the book, and just overall... what the fuck. This is probably the worst trilogy of movies made from a book ever made, which is a shame because the original trilogy of LOTR was almost flawless, and that makes me disappointed. I see all these comments saying ""best movie ever"" which is just ridiculous.

In the chapter that has the battle, the lake towns people realize that if the dragon is dead they are entitled to the money in the mountain, not knowing the dwarves are still alive. A bunch of stuff happens and in the end the dwarves build a wall to the entrance of the mountain, and the Lake town allied with the elves, and they marched on. When they arrive all three parties discuss the treasure and how it will be distributed blah blah blah. At night Bilbo climbs down from the wall and gives the arkenstone to the humans and elves, to keep everyone from fighting. However, the goblins attack and all out war ensues, and Bilbo is ex communicated due to giving away the arkenstone. After a while the eagles show up, and Bilbo gets hit in the head with a rock and misses the rest of the battle. When he wakes, it's all over.

That's it, about six pages and they made a two and a half hour movie out of it. What scummy cash grab.",2018-11-12T20:15:28.000Z,0

I don't understand the hate on these movies even through everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect that. Stretching them out to three instead of two was the best decesion and you can understand why if you watch all of the behind the scenes in the extended addition (which is absolutely worth the hours upon hours it takes to watch :D).  Two films would not have been enough. Shoot, three barely is if you were to include every detail of the book. I know that is what many of us really want but I understand how hard that is to achieve. However these films I truly believed enhanced the book. I know Peter Jackson added in a lot that was not in the book. However I do not see those things as changes that hurt the story but additions that enhance it and help the viewers (especially ones who have not read the book) piece the story together. When your reading the book your OK with details being left out. But from a filmmakers point of view you can't have those gaps or it hinders the flow of the story. So Peter Jackson and his amazing crew filled it in. Everything they added was not blindly thrown in, it was carefully thought out and investigated by breaking down pieces of the Apendecies and then placed it. Not to mention time had to be added in for the fight sequences which are not elaborated in the book because it is almost impossible to have a written description of the battles. But for a film you need to draw the fights out to add to the energy. Legolas and Tauriel were the biggest debate. For me I loved them (although I am not a very critical person and is almost good with anything). To me they added to the storytelling about the Mirkwood elves and gave you a deeper attachment to Thranduil. Tauriel also provided a strong female presence and her and Killi hinted at the scene with Gimli and Gladriel thus expanding on the complicated relationship with Dwarves and Elves. Also who is to say that there wasn't a character like Tauriel amongst the woodland elves. Having her and Legolas split off to spy on the orc strong hold helped connect why and where this second orc army came from. Her grief over Killi also helped add to the heartbreak. 

My ONLY issue is that their was no mourning scene over Fili like there was for his brother and uncle. Fili deserved more tears haha",2016-02-09T02:48:55.000Z,3

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],I liked the fight scenes though I kind of wished they shortened it a bit because unlike LOTR it had tree volumes to it and each of them were big books. The Hobbit on the other hand is a smaller book and then broken into three films which is why it lacked any sort magic that LOTR could muster. Overall I enjoyed the fighting but the dialogue was a bit eehhh and there wasn't really any sense of adventure. They should've left it to 2 films that would've been reasonable.,2015-06-30T14:50:16.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"To all people who think the Hobbit is the last time you will see Middle Earth on the big screen just remember the English copyright laws state that 70 years (Under the 1995 regulations) after the death of the author the material is free to use. The debate will be if JRR is the true author of the Silmarillion/Lost Tales (The only real way to make more Movies/TV shows). JRR may have written the material but his son Christopher finished and published both works so its up for debate who actually ""wrote it"". So lets do some math.

If JRR Wrote it:
Died in 1973 so its 27 years to 2000
2000+43( The remaining # of years) = The year 2043 (Best Case Scenario)

If Christopher Wrote it:
Still alive but 90 years old (lets assume he will die within 5 years, kind of rude I know)
2015,2020 +70 = Between the years of 2085 and 2090 (Worse Case Scenario)

I'm not a legal expert so i'm sure this will be debated endlessly in courts.


But in the end money talks so i'm sure we will be seeing one much sooner

I was very disappointed in the first two, which were a real let down compared to the LOR series. This latest is a totally different animal. I'm not sure if directer Peter Jackson took some of the criticisms to heart from the last two movies and made it right, or he'd always planned the last one to make up for the first two, but it does. For lovers of the LOR series (and you'd have to screwed in the brain not to be a fan of those movies frankly...) this latest movie is much closer to them.

The first two Hobbit movies felt directed at kids, suffered CGI overkill, and just left most serous LOR fans flat. This latest movie is much more adult oriented, CGI used to enhance vs dominate as it did for LOR, solid acting, great battle scenes, and Action from start to finish. It does not have the ""magic"" of LOR, but it's a solid A- movie that almost makes up for those last two duds.",2015-03-26T23:11:11.000Z,0

It wasn't until the last movie where the plot was about war, more or less. LOTR on the other hand was all about war, from the beginning of Fellowship to the end of Return, the end of the world, so the style of visuals had to be more gritty and dirty and dark. I think PJ captured the feeling of both trilogy's perfectly. I still don't understand how people don't think about those influences. ",2015-03-24T17:24:44.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Say what you want about Peter Jackson, but his movies got me into all of the Tolkien books. When i was a kid, i saw LOTR for the first time in theaters and was amazed, which prompted me to read the LOTR book which is one of my favorite books. Then when the hobbit came out a few years ago, that made me read the Hobbit which i absolutely loved. From there i've also read much more of Tolkien's work such as the Silmarillion for example.

I understand Jackson added some extra characters that were not in the book (tauriel, pale orc, legolas, etc). But lets face it guys, this is hollywood, they need a love story (tauriel and kili), an antagonist (pale orc), and one of the most beloved characters from LOTR to get fans' attention (legolas).

Say what you want about the movies, i thought they were phenomenal and were definitely worth the money i spent on a movie ticket. Of course i prefer the books, but the movies help me get a better picture in my head of what the landscape/characters look like which helps me in reading the books. And everyone is mad about the CGI orcs in this film, but i think the orcs look so much more badass than in LOTR where it was just guys with terrible makeup jobs. Just my personal opinion, but i love both series. Not to mention that i can't get enough of Gandalf!!!",2015-02-27T05:39:52.000Z,0

Legolas presence is fine and finding of Aragorn but not killing Bolg instead of Beorn. Beorn killing orcs/goblins and then fucking Bolg would be awesome if it happened in the movie. I also expected the crowning of the King of Eagles and Dain became King and Thorin's burial with the Arkenstone on him and the sharing of gold. I also don't like the ""fuck physics/logic"" things like Bilbo falling hundreads of feet under the goblin mountain and not killing him, Legolas stepping on falling rocks, dragon not tangling the ropes in the kingdom, and other shit like that.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"How can there be so much ignorance about this trilogy? First of all, if you have a complaint, make it a valid one, not like ""wow, such a short book made into such long movies!"" If you didn't know, art makes it possible to stretch one single page of writing to a whole series... but that involves creativity and many other things you're not exactly aware (or capable) of. Secondly, using insults and dirty words all over means you are still around 14 and have no superior reasoning capacities, have a very poor self esteem and many psychological issues. Fact! Also, it's beyond pathetic to give so much time of your life to hating something you don't like. Just get over it! Judging by something so simple as the likes and dislikes bar here, by the web activity of fans, by the hype around the premieres and all events and, ultimately, by the numbers of sold tickets and DVS's, Hobbit haters are definitely a very tiny minority. You don't like this film? Fine! You are perfectly entitled to that... but you can only come across as ridiculous with your silly complaints. No, they didn't 'butcher' Tolkien's work. If you want to call it like that, every movie adaptation does that. That's why it's an 'adaptation'. That's why it's 'based on' a book. You're only showing you have no idea about how art is made, especially how they make the transition from book to film. No, Tolkien isn't rolling in the grave, because he was smart enough to be aware of all the possibilities when he agreed to give away the rights. Also, you're no necromancer to know what he's doing beyond the grave, nor did you meet him while he was alive. And then, Christopher is a bad argument here, because he's a bitter old man looking for massive earnings and biting the hand that feeds. Last but not least, trolls shouldn't bother commenting on this because I don't follow youtube threads. Grow up.",2015-01-29T09:35:50.000Z,1

In my opinion, the movie wouldn't be so deep and entertaining if it was exactly like the book. They did an amazing job to expand the characters' personalities. Character development in the book is almost non-existent and the action isn't great either. If you wanted it to be like the book then you would have EVERYTHING from Bilbo's perspective (so it would be quite one-dimensional) and you wouldn't have scenes like Thorin's touching death scene or the battle at Dol Guldur. Yeah, a few parts were campy but it was never meant to be epic like LOTR.",2015-01-27T00:48:55.000Z,306

I would also like to thank Peter Jackson who achieved, with his amazing, spectacular work, corrections and CANON add-ons on these movies, to have me be entranced, captivated throughout the full length of all three films.
The third movie was the most epic part of this masterpiece, for it included joy, wits, friendship, partnership, romance, sorrow, the soul's strength (for Thorin, who managed to defeat his greed, compared to old Thror) and great amusement in general.

The actors, the costume designs, the make-up, the CGI effects, were all remarkable, majestic.
I believe every person has his own opinion on anything.
We can not have common tastes after all.
Just stop arguing and blaming Mr. Jackson, a person who put so much effort in bringing the Universe of the Hobbit in life, like he did with LOTR, in filming those gigantic blockbusters. And my opinion is, he did great.",2015-01-16T14:41:07.000Z,2

Well they must be blind to see that he over did on the THOUSANDS of endings to the LOTF. Leave the hobbit alone, just because it was faster paced; the characters didnt resite old English literature in random sentences; and was (to be honest) much MUCH cooler than the LOTF doesn't mean it was bad... You don't see the fans of the hobbit saying the LOTFs was sh*t, they say that the LOTF and the hobbit are all in ONE story, all feeding into to other. And that both are great oscar winning movies

the third part was so over dramatic that's for sure, but many cool scenes especially the Lady Galadriel's vs Sauron and the death of kili was so epic and awesome to watch!

1) there wasn't much character development

2) Legolas wasn't supposed to be here.

On the other hand:

1) the other two films set up the characters that mattered so I think it's alright

2) we saw more of the chuck norris of middle earth and the movie did explain why HE was involved in lord of the rings.",2015-01-06T19:35:45.000Z,0

Jackson's films (especially the Hobbit trilogy) are full of KITSCH moments and gratuitous violence. Legolas's battles are just one of them.There are some things which I like, as Galadriel's ,Gandalf's and some other characters' casting, but as a whole I agree with Ursula Le Guin who said the films were  just the shadow of the book. Unfortunately, very soon it's a shadow full of bad taste as we have seen in the Hobbit trilogy.  ",2015-01-06T19:35:44.000Z,0

The fight sequences are edited in a weird way so it looks like they are on fast forward or something.

I think it's a very good read if you want to enjoy Middle-Earth again like me. But it is mainly for children. Some characters didn't even have personalities, for ex. the dwarves. Only Thorin but he was also pretty shallow. Some scenes were so short (like their visit to Elrond in the first part) that to put that in a film would be ridiculous. Bringing back Azog is also not a bad idea. Bringing in Sauron (since there is a mention in the book that Gandalf took care of him) it is not a bad idea. Bringing in Tauriel is not a bad idea since there were no female characters in the story. And it is also interesting that Peter basically switched Bard's and Thranduil's behaviour towards the dwarves. In the book Thranduil didn't rush the war. Bard was the more hostile one.
But my only problem with this third part is the ending. SPOILER:
I think Peter should have shortened the fight scenes and given a proper burial to all the dwarves that had fallen. And also a scene where Dain (like in the book) gives everyone their share of the treasure. Even to Thranduil.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I know there are those out there that stake their claim as either fans of the movie or fans of the book, but as a true student of Tolkeins works, having been introduced to their literary mastery at a young age... I found the movies to be quite faithful to the book and vastly successful at bringing the world of Tolkein to life. 
Tolkein was very strict with his creations and when he sold them, those who obtained them were at first terrified to even approach them. Even Peter Jackson was lost at how to begin tackling the tremendous task of bringing a book to life on the big screen. And while, yes, it does contradict some things in the book, I will go right ahead and defy everyone now who is going to condemn me for saying this.

Tolkein would be proud. 

It is hard to speak for a dead man, and even harder to say that I enjoyed the books more than the movie, and was amazed at its imagery and the faithful representations of the characters from the book. Sure some things were off... The size of Durin's Bane, a little comedy sprinkled onto the trolls, etc. and the tiny risks taken with a vast majority of them being hits.

Tolkein knew that there were few who could truly appreciate his work, and I have to say that Jackson is one of the true appreciations for its majesty. 

For those of you who hate the movies and spit on any adaption that is not an original Tolkein work, that is fine. But respect those who love Tolkein for another reason, and thank those who read the books after seeing the movies. Thank those who shed tears for Boromir and feared Frodo's death. Thank those who laughed at the lighthearted movie Gollum and the extra scenes created by the hand of the original writer as well as Jackson himself. 
We all seem to forget from time to time that no one is Tolkein himself, but there are others besides ourselves who share our deep love of Middle-Earth and all it's people...

When we learn to accept that... I believe we will be better for it, and be one step closer to understanding the true genius of Tolkeins creations, and those clever and brave enough to take up the pen he left for them.

Middle-Earth will never be forgotten... And it will be us to carry on its legend to our children, and our children's children. Our adventures with the Hobbits of Bag-End on their great journeys through the kingdoms of elves, dwarves, and men alike.",2015-01-01T09:52:13.000Z,0

But it wouldn't just be a fighting game you could be on the front lines but if you wanted you could be a stealth person imagine it the humans have pushed into erebor and they are all charging through and your alone watching them from a far. It would have free running and levels with like a level cap of 300 and when you reach the max level you can be one of the heroes for example the dwarves you could be thorin but there could only be 1 on each side. The world would be ever changing depending on the events. The matches would take ages as people could retake objectives for example back to the human one if the dwarves manage to push the humans out they can rebuild the barrier if they find enough rubble. There would be thousands of items and abilities you could use and lots of customization options. It would be third person with good graphics and a huge map.Does anyone think this would be awesome???

Took a very simple story with very human interests, friendship, loyalty, greed, vengeance, teamwork, comradery and turned it into a busy bunch of crap with individual heroes all working on their own separate from a group that accomplishes its goals as a team. If you make excuses for this crap your an idiot !

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I finally saw the film, (spoilers here, so if you have not seen the film then read on at your own risk!) I would say Peter entertained me 68.5% of the time, saw the 3D version, which also added a touch of wonder here and there but was not used to full impact. There were sections that followed closely with the movie that were well done, sections that were made up that were OK and areas that could have been better. I did particularly enjoy the Dol Guldur sequence with the White Council battling Sauron and the Nazgul (taken from the LOTR ROTK appendices).  I personally did not like the way Thranduil was portrayed in this one, he still came off as pompous and self centered, although he did attack the mountain with his army in the books, his intentions and his personality were noble in nature, maybe a bit more rustic compared to Elrond, but admirable. I also felt like the battle scene toward the end of the film did not seem to show the Eagles, Elves, Dwarves and Men winning the fight in any sort of detail, it switched focus to the private battles between Azog, Bolg and the Dwarves, (and Tauriel) and when all the 1:1 conflicts were over the big battle seemed to have ended too. I also was hoping to see more Eagles and Beorn in bear form fighting, I suppose those things will be included on the extended version DVD which I am sure will come out around May 2015. Overall we have begun to take Mr. Jackson for granted, and hardcore Tolkien fans are not going to like many of the liberties he and his writers have taken with the plot, this once again is a film interpretation and is aimed at entertaining both fans of the book and those who have never read them, any director who would take on Tolkien's spectacular mythos and is 68% successful has to be commended, if he changed his mind in 5 years and recreated the Silmarillion in some form I would still shell out $15 or so to see it. Even if it was filled with CGI Balrogs, Dragons and Orcs!",2014-12-31T01:55:40.000Z,0
2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"SPOILERS!!



I guess we all just caught small glimpses of either deleted scenes or scenes that will be added to the Extended versions. 

I watched the movie today expecting to see a few specific things that this trailer showed, but I didn't see them.

1) In the trailer, we see the Elves fire a volley of arrows at, what I can only guess is the Dwarves, as they fire in the exact direction that we see the Dwarves arrive from in the actual movie.

2) In the trailer, we also see a split second scene of Dwarves firing some ballista looking things. Again, not seen in the movie.

3) Lastly, I don't remember any speech from Gandalf in the movie either, yet in this trailer we hear a line that sounds like the end of a motivational speech.
Gandalf - ""You have but one question to answer, how shall this day end""...

I'm rather disappointed that they didn't keep these in, more so the first two as I personally love any and all combat scenes.",2014-12-31T01:07:37.000Z,1

When you watch it as a single movie of 9 hours, it transforms into a much much better movie, a work of art if I dare. It becomes much more well structured, thrilling and emotionally deeper and empathic than watching each film seperately, because it is a single story, and should be viewed as one. Yeah, the films are 7-8/10 each seperately, but together 10/10. Really lives up to the standart of Lotr film trilogy , although they are still the better part of Jackson's work (11/10 :D)",2014-12-28T15:12:14.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"just watched this movie in cinema (3D). I really had big expectations, however I got disappointed. Cgi was really bad, like with smaug, etc. It really felt so game-like experience. It would be a good cinematic for a game, but for a movie it didn't have the same experience.. Also, some of the physics done by legolas were retarded as fuck. A lot of scenes were so not properly developed.. I would give about 7/10. Again, I might be biased because of LOTR. It just feels that it was not enough time to properly master the movie for the producers.",2014-12-28T14:47:04.000Z,1

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"It was cool. I noticed many conveniences like in the other films. There are film rating guide lines and regulations that I know filmmakers must follow in order to keep the rating they desire upheld to their film and that lead me to believe that was why only Orcs were be headed and not humans which seemed dark but the humans weren't which took me out of it a bit. Whenever a human or ""light"" character would be killed they would be saved or some type of ""Dues ex Machina"" would happen to keep them alive. In relation to that I noticed some scenes had a ton of effort for conveniences. An example would be the hobbit in barrels knocking/defeating all the like 15 Orcs away while staying alive.

There were times where the movie wanted to be dark, then funny, then slap stick and dark again. But only horrific and brutal with chopping heads of the ""bad guys"" not the protagonist or ""heavenly like"" character like Legolas.

Legolas is annoying invincible and flawless and still wants to be Fred Flint stone whenever he can. When Woody from 'Toy Story' declared ""falling with style"" Legolas perfectly fits that phrase. This guy is untouchable to the pint where I want him to loose some and I shouldn't feel that way. He even took Rey Mysterio's wrestling love using his legs to clamp down on an Orcs neck and swing himself across to take the Orc down. I was like that's WWF 😮😑 lol, I liked it a lil bit. This lead me to enjoy when the Head Orc beat him or ""roughed him up some"" and made him ""bleed his own blood"" ha ha haaaaaaaa.....  That's goes with other characters too that unreasonably beat and over powered these strong Orcs with brute physical force with thin brittle arms (That lady Elf who had ""the hots"" for the one elf who almost ""took an arrow to the knee"" and had Legolas salty and jelly).

There were some funny moments and I liked some of them. I could see the film was about friendship, trust, journey  and acceptance while conflicting with greed, race war, and power. 

I really liked the boss scene at the end which caught me off guard for a bit. It was recalling good.

Overall I could nit-pick the film a lot and point out a ton of minor things that would make sense for the individual characters motives but I liked it. To counter argue the plausibility of characters not doing what would make sense is to keep the suspense going because if they didn't then the story may not be that compelling or thrilling in tense moments, like when the lead hobbit could've slice the head orcs neck when he was behind him as they were looking at the Eagles. It's all for the sake of Storting telling and I keep that in mind as well.",2014-12-28T08:53:08.000Z,0

There were too many names, so I just called them Gandalf, Dildo Baggins, ninja elf, dragon slayer man, albino orc leader, stuck up prince, ginger elf, midget king, and red dragon.

As for the movie itself, it was very... meh. Dildo Baggins and Gandalf are the only characters I came to like. Everything was just drama, explosions, millions of arrows, more explosions, important fight scene that involves the good guy being saved by another good guy, more drama, and then, before I knew what was happening, the movie ended with a boring ""returning home"" scene.

Seriously though. LOTR needs some comic relief and more interesting characters. Every single character besides Baggins and Gandalf were drama queens.

Then goes with legolas. Then mourns after the dwarf is dead. We could all see leglas trying to pursue her. But she is like nahhh im going to settle for rich guy with elvish army. Im going to be queen hahahah. Then decides to go with legolas's dad in the end. WTF IS WRONG WITH PETER JACKSON? Or tolken? GANDALF CANT CALL THE EAGLES AND JUST DROP THE RING IN THE FIRE OF MT DOOM? Gandalf: i know you have the ring bilbo. Then why dont you fucking put it in a sack and throw it in the mountain? Awkward moments with thorin on top of the orc commander? Why dont you just give the damn arcane stone to thorin? We know you said and the dwarf with the white berad said. It is best if it stays unfound. Because thorins grandfather became insane because of the jewel. Why cant you give the elf his people jewel back? There is like a shit ton of gold in there. You will have a shitload leftover.

and it ruins the LotR parts...i mean, if they havent forgotten about Sauron and his ring, Gandalf did not need to look it up in some old books and find it out/consult fkn Saruman and if he knew Bilbo had the ring (though not knowing its 'THE ring' yet) y get suspicious of him all of a sudden when he used it at his wedding?

It is an average movie. The 1 &2 movie followed the book closely (not perfectly) but it is in the 3e that the book and the movie become 2 separate thing.
(SPOILER)
(SPOILER)

(SPOILER)

The battle become the focus of the movie for about 1h45 of the full 2h24 minutes when it was barely 5 pages in the book. Lots of thing were added, some good like the participation of legolas who link the movies, other were just stranges, like the bats and the second army that serve almost no purpose in the movie. The editing was strange, the movie would cut in the middle of an encounter between protagonist to another group of people far away for no apparent reason,etc. The battle last far too long, it is approximately an 1hour long, after 45 minutes of seeing people kill each other and constant rise in stake, it become more tedious than inspiring.
It wasn't bad but some choices made were out of place or not needed.

Spoiler: Bilbo gets the mega armor but never gets hit anyway.
Predictable script. Every single time someone says ""for war!"" is hammy and obviously set up by previous lines. Then the war is so boring compared to LOTR.
Felt more like that Harry Potter garbage than LOTR. Orlando Bloom has visibly aged, but hasn't improved his acting.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I saw a early trailer of this and there was Dwarf cavalry with battle rams charging to the battlefield.
But in the movie, it looks like its been removed. It would be better and greater if it wasnt removed. Thorin and other companions just rode them from nowhere. Maybe i have to watch it from DVD or extended edition. :(

I dont know world of warcraft was first or The hobbit story was first (because warcraft history is like almost 15-17 years ago)
Ram looks like the one from Dwarf mount in WoW, Lord of the Iron Hill looks like Falstad Wildhammer, Warbeast with Catapult looks like Gronn at World of warcraft : warlord of draenor game trailer. i mean way they plant the catapult.

Maybe Hobbit triology was first though.

Btw, i loved the movie, loved the battle, scale of armies and it was great. just at the end it was hard for me to focus, from crazy battle scene to sudden peaceful scenes or quiet scene.

I will watch it again though i dont care what other says about CGI and shit, but loved it so i dont mind watching it 2 or 3 times.
if u like fantasy styled war with orc and elf and dwarf and men, the u definately gotta see it.,

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"A review of the film I did for my forum
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The latest hobbit film is utterly ridiculous! It is rife with ludicrous and deeply embarrassing overacting,  laboured pontification, and a torrent of mindless slashing, all delivered in over zealous CGI. The actors declaimed as though on a stage in an auditorium, but perhaps they were desperate to gain the audience's attention because they knew they would be fighting for attention with the CGI action which was made less for being so grandiose and arbitrary. Only a rather charming female elf seemed remotely engaged with the real world and her diary was filled to the brim with casually decapitating orcs, being rescued and sobbing, leaving little time for anything else.

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/EvangelineLillyAsTauriel.jpg/220px-EvangelineLillyAsTauriel.jpg

The film was just downright childish, simplistic and bombastic.

Much of the film was an extended battle scene between ""five armies"" that was chaotic, confused and meaningless with the highlight being a fashion statement by an elven army that thought it was on parade, a fashion parade. The elves had the shiniest, gaudiest and best polished armour that seemed designed to light up the battlefield and set new standards of Middle Earth couture. The Elves' idea of fighting seemed to be posing and dancing; they pirouetted and pranced about in a staged choreography that they must have practised day and night because never a foot or spear was out of place in a faultlessly synchronised display.

The director, Peter Jackson, appears to be incapable of delivering credible  characters or narrative. His characters are simply immature; they were schoolchildren playing at being adults and almost all the actors seem to have been instructed to add dramatic weight to their delivery by constantly shouting or grimacing in a failing struggle for gravitas which made them look silly .

The only redeeming features were the girly elf and the rather charming underlying theme of the virtue of English manners and understatement, exemplified by the diffident character of Bilbo who would interject some of the melodramatic and bombastic declamations by other characters with a timid comment, usually a plea for everyone to get along, calm down and be nice. Oddly, the dragon, despite being a sadistic genocidal creature who delivered the most spine chilling moments and most credibility to a character, managed to bring a touch of decorum to proceedings with his perfect diction and grammar.

The film attempted to depict some human frailty, well dwarven frailty, in the corrosive effect on the mind of power and wealth; judgement and empathy were suggested as immediate victims along with general mental well being, but  it failed horribly. The script was hopelessly inept and ponderous as it tackled these themes and struggled to offer anything more than might be expected of an ill-read  teenager forced to consider the subject.

The end of the battle was particularly silly. The elves, having put on a fashion show, retired to clean their armour for the next performance, the dwarves were hacked to a standstill by orcs who had a clever plan, apparently, for some of them to retreat just as they were on the verge of victory, when suddenly the battlefield was overtaken by hordes of huge eagles who could transform into killer bears. They came from absolutely nowhere and without any narrative justification whatsoever, but nonetheless they had a firm idea of their role and slashed away at the remaining orcs. A brief shot of a character on a sleigh who had rescued Gandalf in an early part of the film suggested he was controlling the aerial army, but he could have been a birdwatcher for all the narrative sense his appearance made. It was weirdly arbitrary; as though the director had got bored with hours of battle scenes and turned to the last page of the script, leaving all of the intervening storyline unrendered. The remaining orcs were dispensed in a moment and the backup orc army disappeared and suddenly Bilbo and Gandalf waved their goodbyes after some mutual compliments and set some of the narrative elements for Lord of the Rings.

5/10

Oddly, despite it being littered with flaws, ridiculously immature characterisation, and an inept script, I was entertained. It was so bad it was good in some ways and I don't resent having seen it, and of course there was the elven girly and the fabulously cultured dragon.",2014-12-22T14:25:06.000Z,2

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Before watching the third movie, I was a big fan of The Hobbit. To begin with, LOTR is my bible and the movies are absolutely the best ever made. There can't be a better movie than LOTR.

The first two Hobbit movies were really enjoyable. Sure there are some flaws only LOTR is flawless after all. Everything was going so well. The tention was building thorought Unexpected journej and Desolation of Smaug. The beginning of Battle of the five armies was also superb. But after they killed the dragon in went downside so fast that it ended in the bottom of the ocean. So much hacking and slashing and no story at all. Elf/dwarf romance was silly as hell. And suddenly the movie became a 3d game. Legolas was deffinately playing God of war, controlling trolls with the joyst.... ahem sword. Flying with bads like Kratos with Harpies, I mean come on. This movie was never supposed to be about how many orks can you kill in ridiculuous ways. It became a parody. I didn't even cared about anyone in the end. I cryed my eyes in LOTR several times in sad scenes like Boromir death, here it all seems lame and like a video game.

Now I fully agree with Cristopher Tolkien that Jackson shouldn't be allowed to ruin Silmarillion and make it a CGI orc slaughter movie. I personally would give such a difficult project to Chris Nolan. You need to bond with the characters and to make a believable action scenes just like in LOTR.",2014-12-22T00:44:34.000Z,0

i watched this the other day and it just seemed like another AVATAR movie.

TOO MUCH CGI.

too much battles....

peter jackson did not do really well on this one. i have this feeling he did not read the books properly.

the movie just shows a group of armies killing off each other in some random slope somewhere in Middle Earth or something..

my favorite is <The Return of the King> - it focused on the evil spirit of Sauron and how he manages to manipulate anyone who gets close to the ring

In the second hobbit movie it took only thirteen dwarves to chase the dragon out of their kingdom and almost killed him but then again when the dragon went into that kingdom in the first place it was packed with dwarves. And in this movie it felt like it was stretched out, not enough material. And don't get me started on legolas jumping on falling bricks like he was super mario, why is it that the eagles always come in the end and not in the beginning.

Peter Jackson has done more than Tolkien had thought of at that time. There was more happening than strictly the events of the hobbit at that time, and many of those events began to roll the stones down the hill which became the LotR trilogy. Tolkien wrote a book called the similarion, which has some stories about the events which happen during the hobbit that aren't expressed in the book, and they explain why Gandalf had to leave so many times for so long. Peter Jackson has actually done more than his job required, and I personally believe that his willingness to tie all of middle earth together should be applauded. 

Except for that stupid dwarf- elf love story. That and legolas(while he was alive at that time) is complete bullshit. ",2014-12-20T02:24:19.000Z,0

I know that many critics have had negative things to say about the Hobbit movies being made with so much extra fluff, non existent characters, and too much emphasis on the impending struggle with the One Ring, (they do that here too) but for what it's worth, their are a lot of poignant scenes filled with much emotion on top of the battles that truly get your blood going. Peter Jackson left Middle Earth ALMOST as pristine as when he first got there. Will go again.",2014-12-20T00:32:43.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Well I have seen all three now and I have to say they are a drag, there's cool fight scenes and Peter does them well, but as a big fan of the book and a lot of you in these comments don't seem to know the book well and saying 'it doesn't need to follow the source material', well yes it does other wise it isn't the hobbit its made up shite. The whole three films where more about the dwarves rather than the hobbit, I didn't really feel much for the characters and stretching a 200 page book into three films, you can clearly see its for the money and not for love of film making or for J.R.R's work. But the dragon in the mountain a Thorin's fight with the made up white orc where some of the scenes that really drag also there very silly in areas.

Peter Jackson had been building up to this massive and grandiose battle between five different armies (hence the title). But watching the movie, I never got the feeling it was very epic at all. It felt no more special than their encounter in the woods at the end of the first movie. When I saw the trailer for this, I was excited. It felt much more like the we were going to see a LOTR style battle like Helms deep. But instead what I got were a few close ups, some terrible CGI, and a fight that was lacking, overall.",2014-12-18T19:42:09.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Peter Jackson, I can say without doubt that you majorly fucked up. Before I go into detail about why this film was such a train wreck, let me please explain how Tolkien's life work was not yours to butcher. In Jackson's adaptation of LOTR, you can see how ,despite several book differences, a lot of heart and soul was put in by a crew of people who had clearly read the books. And I can honestly say, despite disagreeing with the decision to make a trilogy, that the first two Hobbit films weren't too bad, quite good even. But moving onto the Battle of Five Armies.
My real pet peeves of the film was the fact that this seemed like a film made for the fans of the films, not the books. The film had a real sense of absence of what Tolkien intended and felt more like fan service for the lovers of 'orc slaying and epic-ness' that had been previously featured in Jackson's take on capturing Middle-Earth. An example of this being a film made for the average movie goer was during a conversation between Legolas and Tauriel where Legolas almost blatantly explains to Tauriel (or the audience as I saw it) what Gundabad is. Now as petty as this seems, I think it sounds incredibly stupid for the son of an Elf prince to explain to a warrior elf what the main fortress of their ancient enemy is. Another annoyance was the constant unnecessary switching between Sindarin and Westeron between the two, it made no sense what so ever, as if a Frenchmen began talking to another Frenchman in French but then to randomly begin speaking English to each other. I also absolutely despised Tauriel and Alfrid, lets begin with Alfrid. Alfrid was a clear reprint of Grima Wormtongue with the exception of over the top villainy and childish humour (also from the Master of Laketown). Tauriel on the other hand was only included to be 'the Hobbit's Eowyn', an annoyingly bland heroine. I disliked her most in this film for the reason to add a clichéd origins story in the plot, so that the viewer might care for her and that it could be reintroduced further into the story.
There was also how lazy and Hollywood-ised this film felt, even some of the acting was bad. Thorin's scene when he threatens Bilbo in the armaments of Erebor was quite frankly hilarious, and Martin Freemans acting felt sloppy, as if Freeman was playing Freeman instead of Bilbo. This is probably due to the absence of Bilbo, don't get me wrong, he had more screen time than Beorn (who was given a mere five seconds just to satisfy viewers like me) but characters like Thranduil had way too much screen time. I was expecting Jackson to make up for this in the ending...which after forty five minutes of introducing all of the cast in the first film gave me an incredible lack of satisfaction. To expect after a thirteen month long journey, he was just going to 'slip away queitly', we don't even learn what happened to Bard, or Dain, or the remaining ten dwarves for that matter, I mean you could always look them up after but it would have been better if they had paced better. Overall, The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies has proven to be a lazy, boring, funny for the wrong reasons, extremely clichéd and a CGI overkill of a movie!",2014-12-17T20:47:47.000Z,1

Thank You JRR and Peter for what you've done, job well done.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"The Hobbit trilogy for me is one of the best examples of movie makers becoming lazy. In the LOTR trilogy, each film costed approximately $100 million each and Peter Jackson scoutted out some of the most beautiful locations in New Zeland to film, had every single piece of armor worn by the orcs customed made, and used trick shooting to make the appearance of Gandolf seem much larger than the Hobbits. In the Hobbit, each film costed approximately $300 million each and they flew all the way to New Zeland to film the entire movie in their most beautiful WAREHOUSE with green screens, made all the orcs CGI and just used CGI to make the hobbits appear smaller. The making of The Hobbit actually brought Sir Ian Mckellen to tears while filming because shooting in an entirely green environment felt so cheap to such a classic actor and he considered it shameful compared to all the effort put into the LOTR films.

Sauron would wait until after the battle, when all the combatants, win or lose, were on their knees, bleeding from savage attrition, to wipe them out, in detail.

Sun Tzu:

1.  Choose the ground, 25%
2.  Know thy limits, 25%
3.  Know thy enemy's weaknesses, 25%
4.  Win without taking the field, 100%.

AT BEST, you can only get a 75% win condition from combining all the available factors leading up to a battle.  But if you let your enemy slaughter themselves unto near corpse like pallor, then you can defeat in detail the remainder at 100% certainty of victory and zero risk of loss.

Bleed for time, bleed for lives, bleed for victory.  But _never bleed for dirt_.",2014-12-17T08:35:47.000Z,0

SPOILER:







About the time where Azog is killing Fili, the lights come on in the theater, and the sound cuts off.  Soon, the stupid First Look advertisements start playing overtop the movie, with all this techno music and whatnot.  Soon after, Fili is getting stabbed in the back to this hilarious assortment of techno music that fits both the expressions and cartoon-like actions of the characters as they run to avenge their fallen friend.  I have never laughed harder in my entire life.  I have it on video, but it would be near impossible for me to share it without it being removed immediately.  I also was laughing too hard to keep the camera steady, and the music is only faintly heard.  I will NEVER forget this.   The movie wasn't very good, but that one moment made it all worth it.",2014-12-17T05:26:25.000Z,2

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"why is so many people afraid, or threatened, or raging about this? Are you afraid that the ones who didn't read the books are going to have a missconception of it? Are you afraid that the books themselves are gonna be ruined by a movie? I promise that when i go and watch the movie, i'll put my LOTR, Silmarillion and The Hobbit books in a safe-deposit box, so they can't get ""ruined"" in the process.
 I know they want to make good profit of a not so long book (because they can't make  movies of everything that they didn't show in the LOTR trilogy), a book that was innocent and fast to read, which was a great fun adventure. Now it became super epic, full of darkness, and not so following the book, and it doesn't feel like it felt when reading the book. But at least this are (very) good quality movies that can actually take you there in that world, make you a part of it, where nothing seems like a plastic full of cgi scenery (i know that in this regard LOTR trilogy was so much carefull). And they can show you a part of the story that they couldn't tell in LOTR, because it was one movie per book, but they are showing it here.
 To me these movies doesn't have the same amount of time or love (i don't know how to call it) than the LOTR trilogy. But i don't have any concern about them changing facts about the books, and making ""The Hobbit"" a whole different experience than the book gave. I loved both movies, and i guess i'll love this too. I know i shouldn't be expecting The Hobbit experience, but some long epic battles full of heroes, and some facts about other books, and i think it won't dissappoint me. I really can't wait to watch this.
PD: I'm just glad they showed Radagast the brown, that is enough for me.",2014-12-16T19:40:00.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Let me just present an opinion of mine regarding the controversy around the Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings. The lord of the rings movies are almost universally preferred over the Hobbit and that is an opinion of mine also, I love the Lord Of The Rings movies because of their gritty and realistic feel whereas the Hobbit has a really bright and goofy feel to it. It's almost as if the LOTR films are centred around the politics of it all rather than the actual adventure. But I also love The Hobbit movies, all three. I just recently saw this one and I now feel like I have the right to share my thoughts. Let me start from the beginning, Frodo in the Lord Of The Rings sets out on his journey for a number of reason, one of which being that he has grown up most of his life with his uncle Bilbo and I have no doubt that throughout the years he has heard Bilbo's stories of his wonderful adventures with Magic and Dragons countless times. So when Frodo sets out on his journey, he has an expectation (which I believe he talks about) of a wonderful goofy, magical adventure with dwarves and goblins and treasure but is swiftly cut down to reality when he treks through middle earth and watches his friends get captured, killed and twisted by the power of this inexplicable evil that he must bare. That is the roots of the story. So for Frodo to have this realisation that life is not like the stories he has so often heard, there have to be stories to match this expectation. If the Hobbit was so dark and gritty, it would not only feel weird, it would actually take away from the thrill of the Lord Of The Rings (for me personally at least). There would be no reason for Frodo to expect a simple adventure and there would be no shock value for the audience of comparing the two tones of the each trilogy. So I think the fact that from start to finish, the hobbit looked like an (awesome) video game is exactly what those movies needed. I think Peter Jackson made these movies what they should've been, it just comes down to whether or not you like that. I do not feel that it is a comment on Peter Jackson's direction. After all, I don't think anyone has a problem with the action in any of the movies. I would be shocked if they did. He gives a masterclass in directing action. Just one man's opinion. ",2014-12-15T02:39:41.000Z,4

I'm fine with some uses of it because it gives the environment more of a beautiful more brighter looking environment in contrast to the more gritty looking environment of Lord of the rings. Not saying I disliked LOTR environment but the hobbit is in a time period where everything seems at peace and is tranquil so it works. But effects like the dwarfs chop the wood log to take down the orcs looks so fake and I don't like how the orcs are very cgi now. They could've made azog a practical creature with makeup and lots of other orcs too. But I love the movies still because it took a great book and expanded on everything that made the book so great And made it better,2014-12-14T21:01:47.000Z,0

To see the Dwarven Company fighting one last battle at Thorin's side, leading the front, priceless. The movie began 11 dec. Today is 14, and i saw it twice. Enjoyed the movies a lot, even considering that the book has only a few pages, but Jackson did a remarkable thing spliting it on 3 parts. Because won't be fair enough with the dwarves, showing them just for a little bid. For me, the job was great. I know that a lot of pleople have a lot to say, thats just what i really think. And also, Dain Ironfoot, is just perfect on the movie, showing that a dwarf will never surrender to a battle. Glory to the Dwarves! Hail Durin!",2014-12-14T03:58:28.000Z,0

 - version I saw has different coloration from trailers, it's not dark and gritty, has more light. Actually looks uglier.
 - many shots and scenes from trailers are not in movie at all
 - there is no blood on screen, even orc blood, even at beheadings. There was a ton of orc blood in LOTR.
 - CGI armies look like modded Rome TW. There was MUCH more variety in outfits in LOTR.
 - seweral Shai Hulud working for orcs and dissapering without trace - no comments
 - plot arcs ends abruptly - dwarves (who is new king???), Beorn (5 seconds of screen time), Radagast etc

I dont want to spoil anything when I say that there are a lot of moments when you get shivers and when you get goosebumps. I just wanted to say a few words to all the ""Hobbit - Haters"" who are complaining about the CGI and about how much better The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is. It is not the same! You can´t compare them. These are two different stories in one world. For me the Hobbit movies are as good as the Lord of the Rings movies and I don´t care what other people say. If you dont like those movies, why are you watching them? Yes the CGI looks (espacially in the last one) sometimes a little bit too much but that doesnt destroy a movie. Well, not for me.

I really loved the movie. Where I live, the movie came out before the initial release :p (I know though, that it came in December 1st on England)




***SPOILER ALERT, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK***
I almost cried when Filli And Killi Died, but when Thorin died, it got a few tears out of my eyes.....
I loved when the dragon died! It was an amazing scene from the film, it was funny though that the fat ass governor got splatted by Smaug's ass! That made me LOL.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Decent movie. Which is bad, because a ""Hobbit"" movie should not be just decent, it should be atleast 9/10 which this movie is not even close to. I am really dissapointed by this movie actually. There were so many cliffhangers that the film just got boring. It was also super-predictable, you knew every time what would happen. Also hate the fact how the dragon died. They made the dragon so epic and built his ""epicness"" up in two movies, just to end it like this. It feels like Peter Jackson just wanted to get him out of the way and so he just killed him in the prelog. Sure, the death could have been good if they just would have made the dragon just a ""dragon"" without personality and shown that he was just a ""object"" who was not really important.  But the picture I got of him in the two first movies was not that one. He deserved a better death and I feel like they could have made something more with him. And when you really think about what happend in the movie in almost 3 HOURS, it was pretty much only a battle at the same location all the movie. 3 hours without any kind of emotion, just fast cuts and weird fighting scenes. Then in the end they just made the ""feels-train"" kick in and killed pretty much every important character which made the ending awful imo. And wtf was up with Azogs closest ""orc-friend""? He sucked at fighting in the second movie and got his ass kicked by legolas and had to escape. But in this movie he whopped ass like never before, dosent make any sense. This movie was not good and stop pretending it was. The CGI was also really bad at some few scenes in the movie, not cool. Same goes with the music, the music has always been really good in the LOTR films but in this movie the music felt like it did not play any important part and had no impact on the film (The other hobbit films used the music alot better.) Imo Peter Jackson can do alot better and the people who actually say good things about this movie, I think should ""rethink"" abit and actually try to accept the fact that this movie was not that great, even tho I really dont want to believe it myself. A bad ending for such a cool trilogy. I am not a hater, but after these 16 years, I expected something much much better.",2014-12-12T22:15:55.000Z,0

To say that it was just great - to say nothing, because I would have given Peter Jackson Award for the Smaug's attack on the Lake Town and powerful ending. And for the film as a whole.

Yes, there are drawbacks, such as a suspicious story focusing on unimportant personalities, definitely some strange scenes and inappropriate humor. The battle itself could be a little more ambitious, though, and so very cool.

Nevertheless, despite all the bad places, the film does not disappoint. Entry is so good that I shed a few tears from what I saw familiar faces and the coolest dragon in the history of cinema at its most violent state.

The film itself (by the way, it will be shorter the previous parts) stumbles here and there, but still kept confident. Well, that Comrade Jackson master of battle scenes - could be observed in the other books of the trilogy by Tolkien. The ending is simple and good.

A little sad that such a great director says goodbye to the world of Middle-earth. If you love fantasy, dragons, battles, intrigues, read the book ""The Hobbit"" and she fascinated you - feel free to go. You will not regret. I would have went. 10 times.

Thank you for ""The Hobbit"", Peter and everyone else who had a hand in its creation, as well as excellent translators and voice actor trilogy of films in Russian. The song in the credits mesmerizing.",2014-12-12T17:47:11.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"For everyone thinking about going to the movie, think twice. I can't submit a review on metacritic for the ""movie is yet to bee released"". But what you see in the trailer/ teaser is not what you get from the movie - Of course you get all the parts as seen but under different circumstances. The trailer does make a good impression and the majority lies on drastic character moments.
Be not mistaken. The movie sadly became too CGI infested and parts in too many ways from the original (book) to be fully enjoyed - especially the second half. The battle is just a pain to watch because there's no depth (it can't be described otherwise, you just feel like it's second nature and nice to look at but misses real threat). Further the love stories and drama are over the top. Maybe it's just my opinion but the majority of spectators in the cinema I was were laughing all over those scenes, cause they were so over-exaggerated. I don't say all is bad but the second half of the movie is - overall - hard to watch (and I don't mean all 100% of the second half) cause it's unreal und unbelievable (Yes, I'm aware it's a fantasy movie but why does everything has to be so pumped up??).
Maybe those who are going to watch the movie anyway will think of my opinion as unreliable - which is your right, as I'm subjective - and others will like the movie in the end for what it is. I'm simply saying it is not what it could be (which means not a dream-version where everything is perfect, but a good narrative as well as execution similar to the quality of LotR) and I really miss that the bad parts (CGI, not true to story, exaggeration, drama & love story, character behavior) ruin something that could have been great in the end.",2014-12-12T16:10:04.000Z,0

The only movie that I can say with honesty that was better than the book was Jaws. The movie certainly did not follow the book.

One reads books to be challenged mentally or to place yourself in a similar situation as a person. Movies do not make one think as much, if at all.

The Count of Monte Cristo, there is a scene in books where he is in the bag as he is to be thrown down into the sea, how does one handle that part in a movie?

Only his pen can create such a world. Stop complaining how bad movies are etc. I bet you all can do it better, yeah sure of course you can. You all have a degree in movie making and special effects and realizing a fantasy on screen. Sure you are ALL professionals, right? STOP the non sense and enjoy the movie, none of us could do a better job! Tolkien's creation is too complex to get a proper grasp of his imagination!! Some of you are dissapointed because it did not live up to your expectations?? then NO movie will ever please you! some you want more and more. Technology only goes to e certain extend and we should be grateful for such a fantastic storyline to be realized on screen!! Books like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Game Thrones (because obviously successful) are exceptional! There is only a few humans, who have the capability to go beyond their imagination! They are seriously gifted! and to realize these novels into movies is a serious challenge, because while reading the books, everyone can agree that your fantasy is key and that alone cannot be produced on screen. is unique! maybe that's your problem (those who complain) you let your imagination ruin it, instead of enjoying a different perspective of it!!

You watch movies BASED on books (NOTICE THE BASED) so you can see a different interpretation that what you read. It doesn't really matter Jackson changed things in the universe, for it the movies' universe is different from Tolkein's.

Mixed feelings after leaving the theater. I'm not happy, how the story was changed. Tauriel/Kili took too much time and was dragging even more, nothing but a glimpse of Beorn, I felt like Fili was left out a bit and his death of lame and quick and then he was just forgotten, Fili and Kili should've gone to defend Thorin from Azog and die together. You stole that scene from me. Though it's hard to choose, probably my favourite scenes were the Dol Guldur battle, Bilbo and Gandalf sitting silently Thorin's madness and when he remembers who he really is, Thorin's death: Freeman and Ermitage portrayed that beautifully and it was really sad. Makes me even more sad and somewhat empty, that this journey is over and this was possibly the last Middle-Earth film. I will go see it again, despite it's flaws and start waiting for the trilogy boxset.",2014-12-10T19:55:31.000Z,0

The amount of editions they put into the film (eg:fire) are amazing. Maybe they spoiled LOTR and middle earth Fantasy but at least you can see some new shit and fightining. I saw Gandalf die in the trailer, but I thought that he cannot be killed, why is that? Maybe some dark powers or something... Hmm... They should really do another Harry Potter, It would be great. Plus, there is nothing offensive or racist in the vids (I saw some stupid comments) Just because they Did not add other ethnic people doesnt mean they are racist.

It's a movie, and considering how short the Hobbit is it's a masterpiece what Peter was able to do with the Trilogy. Show some respect for the love of god....this is the last time we will see middle earth (possibly for forever, unless somebody decides to remake the films in the next few decades) and i would honestly MUCH rather have a good trilogy to end this off with then 1 movie. The CGI is top notch, and it will look even better in the movie because this is just the trailer, that was done a while ago so the CGI will def. be improved in the actual movie. Stop complaining about it not being like the book when it clearly isn't meant to be completely like it. Unlike most directors of today, Peter didn't just take what he could from the book and mixed it in the movie but he actually made an almost new story out of it. So jesus fucking tap dancing christ if you don't like it then don't watch and go away. 
Anyways, now that im done with that rant...SO EFFING EXCITED FOR THE MOVIE! It's a bit sad it's the last we will see of this place but im still hyped! Can't wait for it come out! ",2014-12-09T17:05:46.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I've been a huge fan of Tolkien for most of my life.  I'd read the Hobbit by the age of 9 and the LOTR by the age of 12.  I've since read each of them several times over, as well as the lesser read works, such as the Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales etc.  I've even read things like 'Farmer Giles of Ham', 'Tree & Leaf' and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'.

The relevance of all this ^ ?  I'm still looking forward to this film enormously!  :)

Too many people are moaning about discrepencies between the book and the films.  The same accusations could be levelled at the LOTR films, which I also loved.  I accepted the fact that journeys were truncated, that Tom Bombadil and Goldberry were left out, that Glorfindel was replaced by Arwen and the whole Aragorn/Arwen love story padded out.  I could understand the cinematic reasons for such choices.  I even overlooked more serious deviations.  Such as Saruman working directly for Sauron, instead of for himself... or the complete omission of the 'Scouring of the Shire'.  The latter, for me, being one of the most important chapters in the book.  It's omission was the only serious complaint I had with the films.  I let it go though, as overall he had captured the feel of the books so well and the main story remained largely unchanged.

So we come to the Hobbit.  A slim book, written for children.  Albeit one that is also enjoyed by adults.  He could have made a children's film, interspersed with references for adults but I doubt that would have gone down well.  Especially since the expectations following his LOTR films were so high.  Instead he chose to go in a similar vein.  Obviously it would require more padding but... and it's a crucial 'but'... virtually all of the extra story is either implied and extrapolated from the Hobbit itself, or sourced from Tolkien's other books set in, or about, Middle Earth.  The main narrative storyline remains unbroken and all of the major events in the book also occur in the film.  He's stated, quite clearly, that this wasn't a straightforward re-telling of the Hobbit alone, that he wanted to widen the scope to include other elements of Middle Earth that were contemporary and to expand on some sections of the Hobbit that were interesting but for which there was little detail.  I think he's done this pretty successfully.  Yes there are elements added that don't occur anywhere in Tolkiens writings but they aid the plot and the narrative drive.  The timeline of a couple of events maybe slightly out too.  None of these detract from the film, nor do they feel as if they are things that don't belong in Middle Earth.  Even the slight anachronisms don't feel particularly anachronistic, in the context of the film.

You are already suspending your disbelief, re' magic, elves, dwarves, hobbits, orcs... the whole of Middle Earth in fact.  Just relax, suspend it a tad more and enjoy the films for what they are,  Great storytelling, the mould of Tolkien, set in Tolkiens world.  No the are not an exact representation of the book, 'the Hobbit'.  They aren't meant to be and they never could be.  If it annoys you so much, that they aren't an exact re-telling, that new characters have been added, parts expanded on and other (generally consistent) bits added... then don't go and see the films.  For those that are able to overcome their 'rage' at such things, sit back and enjoy the show!  ;)",2014-12-08T03:53:27.000Z,1

I didn't object to the things in the books that he left out of the movies. I object to the things not in the books that he made up and put into the movies. Watching Game of Thrones made me realise more than ever how poorly constructed Peter Jackson's Tolkien-based movies truly are.",2014-12-07T12:03:09.000Z,2

Tolkien wrote the book in a pretty simple way, without many details. Like ""This person died"" ""and then this happened"". Also, Bilbo is unconscious during the fight, so we don't find out many things about it. It's like Tolkien made it possible for someone to add details - which fits perfectly in the movie. The added things will make it more exiting, so stop complaining. Tolkien's story made a great book, but in my opinion, it had to change a little to be a good (great) movie! And the overall story is still the same.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Yes, The Hobbit is a cash grab.  Perhaps the CGI is too heavy.  Maybe it didn't exactly follow the book to the letter.  And yes, maybe the 48 fps was a different  experience that some didn't like.  But throughout each of these films, I found myself loving every second of it.  People keep complaining that this film didn't live up to LOTR, yet they forget that the Hobbit story was written by Tolkien as a fun adventure instead of the detailed epic that Lord of the Rings was.  In retrospect, The Lord of the Rings (book or film) is one large story split into three parts.  Its my favorite film franchise and book series ever, so I was very interested to see what Jackson would do with this new trilogy.  With the first two installments, I had a blast.  The action (particularly in the Goblin-town tunnels in An Unexpected Journey and the barrel riding scene in The Desolation of Smaug) were very well-done and entertaining.  The characters were likable and interesting, with Freeman's Bilbo being the best version of the character yet and Armitage's Thorin Oakenshield being a fantastic addition.  I could feel the emotion that made the Lord of the Rings such an epic experience, with Bilbo's speech about home & the dwarves walking through the caves of their lost home being truly moving scenes.  Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Smaug was a revelation.  The actor not only brought the mighty dragon to the big screen, he truly gave us the most memorable dragon ever in cinema.  I'd argue he has been the most charismatic and interesting villain in the entire franchise, including Lord of the Rings.  The Riddles in the Dark scene between Gollum and Bilbo was absolutely brilliant, actually making me laugh and feel the tension throughout.  Andy Serkis will always be captivating as Gollum, who will soon become one of the most fleshed out characters of the franchise.  So was the Hobbit a cash grab?  Yes, but I don't see all these complaints about The Hunger Games or Harry Potter's final installments being turned into two parts.  While I really loved both parts of Mockingjay and the Deathly Hallows, they never fully sold me on them being made into two films.  But whether or not the Hobbit should've been split into a trilogy, to me they have justified their existence by each being a memorable and epic experience.  And when people complain how it doesn't follow the book, they seem to forget the Lord of the Rings trilogy really didn't follow the books much either.  Jackson made a lot of changes to the source material, and the results were fine with me.  Legolas wasn't in the book, yet Bloom was a welcome return who was great in each scene.  Radagast the Brown was a little strange at first, but he was certainly a fun character who shouldn't even be compared to the horror that is Jar Jar Binks.  He isn't George Lucas, who created a prequel trilogy based on action figures and merchandise.  Jackson instead has crafted a very entertaining and exciting trilogy that I felt has justified being created.  I would agree some of the CGI could've been toned down a bit, i.e. the Orcs not having the same impact being CGI beasts instead of real actors.  Makes it lose a bit of the grit, but doesn't ruin the experience and I truly still felt that I was in the same Middle-Earth that I fell in love with 13 years ago.  The Hobbit was never meant to surpass Lord of the Rings, but when its all finished in a few weeks we will have the best saga of films ever made.  I will watch all six Middle-Earth films with a smile on my face, loving every second of it.  While The Hobbit may have been a cash grab, most films in Hollywood nowadays still haven't come close to the incredible impact that these films have on people including myself.  I realize most people enjoy these films, but I just wanted to address people complaints about its comparison to Lord of the Rings.  So thank you Peter Jackson, for once again giving me an unforgettable experience.  ",2014-12-05T03:27:13.000Z,1
2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"In my opinion, I don't think the Hobbit is going to be good. The 3 movies are supposedly based on the book The Hobbit? They are literally just making stuff up as they go along, for those who are too lazy to read, there was no Pale Orc or, or Legolas, not even a love story between Kili and whatever that Elf Girls name is... And the Lord of the Rings References? Constantly talking about Sauron and crap... This is the Hobbit... The Story of Bilbo Baggins and his adventure with Gandalf and the Dwarves, not just a sequel to the Lord of The Rings (Don't argue, it's pretty much what it has turned into..). The Hobbit is supposed to be it's own adventure, it's own (ONE) movie would've cut the cake, but Peter had to go and Pretty Much Rip Apart everything the Lord of the Rings was good for... Don't get me wrong, the Lord of the Rings added and left out quite a bit from the original trilogy, but they did it right... They didn't make a whole movie toward a battle that only lasted two chapters in the book... (Yes, the Battle of the Five Armies only lasted about 2 chapters, for those who do not read)...

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],People keep saying Lord of the Rings was WAY better. Why does no one realize how much the lotr movies were different from the books. Peter Jackson left out ALOT like Tom Bombadil and all the stuff about the ents. And the reason the hobbit is split into three movies is because in the book there was so much action and in lotr the rings it was very stretched and wordy. I liked the previous movies and I think this will be just fine. I'm wondering if the battle will be more epic than helms deep or Minas tirith.,2014-12-05T01:41:55.000Z,0

""LotR was 3 books, so 3 movies, ok. But The Hobbit is only 1 book and 3 movies FUCK THIS""

Well, if you read the LotR books, you know that the movies took away 80% of the books. Peter Jackson could easily had made like ""Fellowship of the Ring pt 1 and pt 2"" and so with TT and RotK.

But he didn't, and made a great adaptation for the movies, even if he took away 80% of the books.

But he is using the whole book of Hobbit to make 3 movies. Yeah, i agree that 3 is a bit much, but 2 movies would be awesome, exploring all the book pages. The problem with The Hobbit 2 is that like...50% of the movie didn't exist in the book.

I don't have problem with this trilogy, Hobbit 1 was great, 2 was good and i bet 3 will be awesome.

Yeah The Lord of the Rings trilogy is far more superior than The Hobbit Trilogy, but they're still fun and entertaining to watch! And also, I bet we can all agree that these are better prequels than the ""Star Wars"" ones lol. Even though ""The Hobbit"" isn't exactly what I hoped It be after watching ""The Lord of the Rings"" I still enjoy them because of the nostalgia of when I first watched ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" in theaters back when I was five.The Hobbit is enjoyable, and fun, and I surely can't wait to see The Defining Chapter of this Story-filled Middle-Earth Saga. :) ",2014-12-03T01:08:56.000Z,0

From my super-geek perspective, you are both right! The flashes that were in the Lord of the Rings books are necessary for the transition to make both trilogies be a part of the same story, however, this story could have been done in two movies instead of three. Another thing that really pisses me off is the added side-stories that were not written in the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit, such as the cross-breed love story. WTF were you thinking?!?!? Either way, this movie cannot be worse than the previous one and should tie together a lot of holes between the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings!",2014-12-02T01:04:39.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"C'mon people. I know that Jackson took creative galore over The Hobbit saga as opposed to the LoTR trilogy, but does that account for flipping off on a movie bred that answer to many of the fans which still has the LoTR 'craze'? This movie probably won't abide to what the original book is about, but, think about it. Do you really stick to what you're supposed to do? Have you not tried and get out of your miserable, comfy hole? Do you really know what's best in the interest of yourself? Have you ever asked yourself, what if, what's written on the book for this movie translated to the silver screen and what is on said screen for this particular movie went to the book? You would be typing the same exact derogatory remarks about the movie which is not the same from the book, as you are now, you Hobbit detractors. Sure, you never know if you would do so, but, though the CGI is too exaggerated(Take, for example, how the Orcs look from the LoTR trilogy as compared to The Hobbit's Orcs, which is so less terrifying than the LoTR ones), Legolas looks.......... different(What's wrong in keeping his original look, Mr Jackson?), and this probably won't stand up to Return Of The King, it certainly will give what most people want, which is the shock and the ""wow"" factor, and another story to know from Middle-Earth. Look at how much money the last two installments of The Hobbit made and tell me I'm off my mark. And I'm pretty sure that some of those people who begged for a new installment of Middle-Earth criticized The Hobbit for not being what they felt it should be, and I wonder if they will still be bitching on another Middle-Earth saga release if The Hobbit never sprang up. One of these days, people should learn to at least appreciate what they receive, no matter how rigged it might be. And hey. Have anyone ever thought about voicing out loud ""the conditions"" on what the next saga would be in the film production crew and the creative staff? Or even the fans?",2014-12-01T18:11:54.000Z,0

All people below complaining about how Peter has butchered the Hobbit - I agree with you. Alright? Wholeheartedly, I do. But please. We've got 3 weeks left until the _last movie ever set in Middle-Earth_ comes out. Can we just enjoy it? You can nitpick and complain all you want later. Peter is trying. He really is. But the problem is today, no one wants story. All anyone wants is cheap action (Micheal Bay, Transformers, I'm looking at you). I know we've witnessed the George Prequel Lucasification of these movies. I realize that. But if you really think about it, Peter's doing the best with what hes got. And I don't think anyone could've done any better.

So lets just finish the ride we got on 13 years ago. If you want to throw up upon departure, washrooms are to your left. But this is it for Middle-Earth for a long, _long_ time.",2014-11-29T19:03:02.000Z,55

Don't get me wrong, I agree that they could have just made one movie since the book is laround 200 pages, and that they shouldn't have added so many things that wasn't in the original book. Concider, however, how boring the movie would be if they followed the plot in detail, since most of the book were just specifying how they travelled around and sang on their journey to Smaug.

As its own story, I still find this to be a great trilogy, but they should have kept it more to the original. The soundtracks, the effects and the plot is great, with the exception of some things that didn't have anything to do with the original storyline.",2014-11-28T21:26:43.000Z,0

Then there's Se7en, which is the same world but far, far, far darker.

if you created the most epic trilogy out of the Lord of the Rings, a really honorable and true adaption from Tolkiens Idea of Middle Earth, then people love you for that.
Lets say...
if you created a trilogy from the Hobbit, a little childs book and add some flavor to it, then people hate you for that AND that before they loved!
Means, once you created something that does not hit the status quo of peoples idea of an adaptation does not only destroy the movie itself, it means it destroys the movie before that movie too, namly the Lord of the Rings.

You can't deny that Jackson has some excellent story telling within the films so far.
You may moan about it being made into 3 films, but I say it's great. The more the merrier! My only upset is that this will be the last Middle Earth film Jackson makes, as he has no rights to the other books.

Go jump off a cliff. Any movies made about the lord of the rings universe are a gift to the people who enjoy that universe. You should appreciate all the hard work people put into making these movies. If they are successful and popular why bitch and complain?

Oh that's right because your either jealous or you think your part of an elite group of hard core lord of the rings fans. Don't make me laugh lol.

FYI: If you don't like the movies and love the books so much then keep your complaints to yourself and go back to reading them. ",2014-11-23T01:49:05.000Z,4

If he wanted epic battles and so forth he should have made a movie out of the Silmarillion. There is enough material in that notebook for 3 movies. But this crap it disgusts me.

Even hobbits came in different colors, including the darker Harfoots. Elves are fair complected, and that is that. There were the Moriquendi, or Elves of Darkness, but that was not because of their skin tone. Back in the day before airplanes and globalization, most of our world's darker complected races were more southernly located. This is simply how we as the race of Men evolved. So it is not racist that most of the darker skinned men lived to the south in Middle Earth. It was like that here in our own world for a very long time.",2014-11-22T04:48:39.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"This looks better than the last two hobbit movies, which isn't a great feat. They are simultaneously over-embellished and lazy. I grew up with the lotr movies, these recent movies do not compare at all favourably. Jackson has truly pulled a George Lucas. 
By any measure from the quality of the colour grading to even the casting (all very poor except for bilbo and characters retained from lotr) these movies have been very disappointing for me. There is no perceptible sense of threat, the villains aren't scary, because they are animated, and action too frequently descends into video game territory and is ludicrously physicsless, I greatly missed the effect of such performers as Lawrence Makoare (Lurtz, Gothmog, Witch-King) that are not adequately replaced by computer magic. I now am regretfully going to turn to some absolute legends, the script by Walsh, Boyens and Jackson is lazy and makes for poorly structured movies as it was never meant to span 3 films (pj milking it for all its worth) filled with empty one liners and stupid gags. Sir Richard Taylor, yes I will go there, some of the design is detached from the possible as the movie makers have gotten carried away. There is a supreme lack of the defining aesthetic of lotr, that it should look like history not like improbable fantasy. Sir Howard Shoare, the scores to lotr are absolute masterpieces. I can't say I remember any of the tunes from these hobbit movies, but I could hum for you now a lot of lotr stuff (even as musically untalented as I am). Andrew Lesnie, who is the absolute genius DP has gone for such fantastical lighting I don't believe the environment, I don't like 48fps it just looks awful. Stephen Fry, I am one of his biggest fans and think he is a fine actor but doesn't fit and feels out of kilter with the Middle Earth of mortensen's Aragorn, hill's Theoden, bean's Boromir and Tyler's Arwen. This is typical of these movies, they don't function on any level as a credible sequel.
Having said all of that, this movie may be saved by that line from Gabdalf at the end of this trailer, all hail the almighty Mackellan.",2014-11-20T08:04:16.000Z,1

It is so pathetic in eveery hobbit video to see comments like ''WE WANTED THE HOBBIT, NOT THIS'' and stuff. IF YOU WANT THE HOBBIT, READ THE DAMN BOOK! And stop flaming the movies, which always claim to be BASED! BASED on the book, not THE book itself.

THE CHANGES
I, myself, admit that this whole CGI stuff is uncool. But stop claiming that the story is destroyed this way. Yeah, Thror wasn't decapitated, but his neck broke on the impact with Azog, Thrain had already died before Hobbit, and definitely without a Wilhelm scream, Azog had died and his son had taken his place, there was no Tauriel or Goblin King, Legolas didn't appear in the Hobbit book, there was no Arkenstone. SO WHAT? The movies industry always adds extra characters, changes the plot a bit, adds out-of-topic love etc. Just enjoy the movie for what it is, not what it COULD be. Otherwise, just don't watch it. No one obliges you after all, am I right? Chk.",2014-11-19T15:39:00.000Z,25

It's a really unique franchise. It's a complete fictive world and you won't see another franchise that tries to do the same because it's just impossible. It's not like Divergent, Maze Runners etc that tries to copy Hunger Games. Now THAT's bullshit. Hobbit and LOTR aren't. Anyway. That's just my opinion.

I'd definitely tackle on the challenge of adapting The Silmarillion to film(s). The sheer magnitude and lore of that book, and the most epic battles you'd ever see on screen would be a sight to see. Morgoth Bauglir and the War of Wrath. What about the battle between Melkor and Fingolfin? He wounded Melkors face seven times, eternally gifting him pain for the rest of his life.I also remember there being a huge monster/dragon like creature that would move mountains with a single swing, and create infernos whenever he stepped. He was bigger than any mountain.

Too bad Christopher Tolkien isn't ready to give the rights for the book for a film adaptation, maybe for the better, maybe not.

It's included in the appendix's of The Lord of the Ring books. Granted they have added their twist to it by juicing it up a little (that prolonged Erebor scene with the dwarves and Smaug) but hey it's their last Middle-Earth movie they CAN ever make! They can't make anymore. So hey why not split it into three movies. Why not add more detail and material. Heck there's barely enough story in the Hobbit book for two movies. On the CGI aspect, Jackson wanted the Hobbit movie to be like the book as in he wanted the orcs and goblins to seem kiddish, not scary and mature like in the lotr movies. That's why a lot of it is CGI. Plus New Line sorta forced Jackson to do this. Personally, I love these movies! Film is subjective and everyone has their own opinion.

And if you don't like the changes in the movie, go read the book and frame it above your bed. P.S. I read the book myself (and sorry for my English)",2014-11-16T14:52:28.000Z,2

Ah, the good old CGI discussion in youtube.. Is that the only thing the CGI whiners are focusing when watching the films? 
Already the trailer shows that this movie is gonna be very character oriented..
The main reason to make 3 movies is to connect it better to the LOTR-trilogy. I dont give a shit if movies dont follow the book precisely. And i have read the book. So far this Jacksons approach has been better than the silly childish tone of the book..
Of course these arent nearly perfect films, but there is now ""perfect"" film in the world. I dont get all the pointless yelling about CGI(Which is best in the business and i watch a lot of movies), nitpicking and ""stretching"" the story. So far The Hobbit-trilogy has been very entertaining, so i dont care to complain the minor flaws it has.",2014-11-16T14:22:11.000Z,5

These movies look amazing, who the crap cares how they were made because THEY LOOK EPIC. The world of Middle Earth is supposed to be epic and crazy and I am fed up with people hating on these movies simply because Jackson uses the technology available to him......also who the crap walks into a movie and actually cares about the animation being too good and used too often? The only time I complain about something like that is when the animations are terrible and in this case, they aren't.....in fact, they are stunning.....and also, the fact that people say the trolls and monsters in this movie are completely unrealistic and not believable is literally the dumbest comment ive ever heard....people, they are make believe trolls in a make believe universe filled with make believe characters and you say they aren't realistic?? and frankly I don't understand why Ian McKellen was crying, I mean I know what he was trying to say but when they filmed the Lord of The Rings, as well as the Hobbit movies, they traveled to amazingly beautiful places to film, so the fact that he gets upset with filming alone confuses me.....I mean I feel for him but c'mon dude, you get paid and get to travel to some of the most beautiful places on earth, heck I haven't been outside the USA once and I don't get paid to live in boring ol' Texas but I'm not here crying when I don't get my way....not trying to be inconsiderate cause green screen doesn't sound fun but I am just sick and tired of all the hate that these films get.....

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"One thing many of you are missing; Jackson PURPOSELY made this to look like it was indeed made before the LOTR trilogy-looking more like a Video game from 2000 than 2010's far superior special effects, AS TO NOT MAKE THE LOTR TRILOGY LOOK INFERIOR! The addition of new effects were implemented, BUT NOT IN A WAY TO RUIN LOTR! What else should he have done, ruin 3 classics that are his legacy with 3 films stretched out beyond belief from 1 minor book (in comparison) & be accused of trying to remake LOTR???
We BEGGED, he answered, before the grayt Gandalf passes away! He took little to work with, gave his FILM & BOOK fans what we ALL wanted, & kept the 3 classic, all-time great film classics intact!
Afterall, LOTR trilogy will be watched AFTER The Hobbit trilogy in years to come, in chronological order. This way, LOTR will actually look even better than the Hobbits-APPROPRIATELY!

Every1 should be happy enough, all things considered!

Bottom line, Peter Jackson wasn't trying to top any1, himself,  nor anything. He kept it real & as if it were made before LOTR, it's that simple. He had a lot of different types to satisfy, mainly his avid followers who watch ALL of his films, with this fun & risky trilogy. WELL DONE!",2014-11-16T01:52:08.000Z,1

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],While I do feel the overuse of CGI takes away from the overall aesthetic of the film I still very much enjoy the film series itself. I mean I understand why fans will be annoyed due to the fact they never used as much practical effects as they did in the original trilogy but it's been nearly 10 Years since then so they were obviously going to increase the visual effects. Plus 10 Years ago visual effects were new and exciting take for example gollum everyone felt he looked fantastic and everyone was excited about the possibility of these fantastic visuals that we could do and nowadays but currently high visual effects are the norm in Hollywood and people are more aware of the technology that's been used so I feel that's why many people may feel a bit strongly against them! Still enjoyed the first two films regardless :) ,2014-11-15T12:45:02.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I have no idea why people complain about these movies. CGI, find me a fantasy movie that doesn't make use of CGI these days. It's there, it's cheaper to use and it looks good so deal with it. As for the story changes, it's not like PJ Philippa Boynes and Fran Walsh are completely making it up as they go. It's all stuff from tolkiens mind. Also if you tried to adapt a book word for word to a film it'd make for a very boring ass book. I realize Legolas wasn't in the hobbit. But that's just cuz he wasn't mentioned. He's the damn kings son so it's entirely plausible that he'd be present for these events. Things need to be changed and cut out or added from a book for the film to be entertaining. That's what people don't get. Stop trying to look at them as failures for the CGI and changes and start looking at them as an adaptation. It's called an ADAPTATION  for a reason. People need to stop judging so harshly. If not for the fact that they're actually doing a very good job with these films then for the simple fact that's they're just movies. Life will go on if things are different and CGI is used I promise. ",2014-11-13T20:36:23.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Damn this movie looks really good. A lot better then Desolation of Smaug. I am begginig to see a pattern here, similarly with Lord of the Rings.
Fellowship was a really good movie, and had it's great moments, but overall it was judged to be just good, not perfect.
Two Towers had even less fans - it had it's badass moments like the first movie, but PJ really overdid it in some scenes (The scenes with Ents were boring and dragged for way too long, the elves under the helms deep was such a major change from the books that it made a lot of funs dislike the movies).
The Return of the King was so epic it got a bazillion rewards including world record of oscars, and made up for the sins of two towers so much that the entire trilogy is considered timeless and great.

Hobbit was exactly the same. First movie was very decent, had it's minor mistakes, and overall was good but not perfect.
Desolation had it's epic moments like the first movie, but the overuse of Legolas and Tauriel that was a major change from the book annoyed a lot of fans, and Smaug not being able to catch a bunch of dwarfs in his own house also was overdone.
This movie, I think, can actually make up for the sins of Desolation and add to the already nice spotlight first movie had. If this is as epic and good as it looks, this can truely make hobbit trilogy something that will be remembered.",2014-11-12T16:15:53.000Z,40

Part of what made the LOTR series so enthralling was how real they seemed, how vile and grotesque the makeup made real people seem.  Now all I see is pixels that take away the immersive feel the LOTR trilogy provided.  I understand Smaug, the trolls, and the spiders all have to be computer generated, but switching from real people acting as orcs to CGI orcs was an absolutely dreadful idea.  Ian McKellen, the actor who plays Gandalf, broke down in tears on set in the first movie because he was acting by himself in front of a green screen, attempting to interact with nonexistent beings convincingly.  He then said ""This is not why I became an actor.""  I can see where you're coming from, Mr. McKellen.",2014-11-12T05:22:17.000Z,33

For example the river chase scene from DoS was absolutely asinine. A completely CG Bombur fights a dozen orcs while wearing a broken barrel as armor and wielding two axes. Bombur, an obese dwarf, then proceeds to jump into a moving barrel with PERFECT timing. I get that this is fantasy and 99% of the time I can let go, but that sequence of events hurt my brain.

Also not one of the dwarves from Thorin's crew is even half as cool as Gimli was. They're all pretty much interchangeable as far as I'm concerned. You think that during the course of three movies we'd get to know or like them more, but somehow Peter Jackson screwed that up. Instead we got a shitty love interest thing with Handsome Dwarf 1 and Elf Lady That Doesn't Exist.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],There are movies who either omitted or even add on scene from a book. Then there are movies trying to follow the book...that's kind of hard to put all that detail or sometimes lack of detail in a movie so that people watching it can follow. People have to remember that a movie is a different medium then a book. All movie makers have to be aware of their audience. There are the one who chooses what is best for the viewers who are going to watch the movie. Not the people who read it and expect that exact experience. Adapting different kind of mediums are hard enough. Don't down one because they did do what the first one did. I say enjoy both in its own unique twist. ,2014-11-11T07:22:27.000Z,25

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"The biggest problem people fail to see in movie directing/writing a story is that every story, regardless of what it is about or what it is going to be, needs an antagonist and a protagonist. In the book, everything fits perfectly, and is really well done. But to directly transfer it from a book to a movie wouldn't make a lot of sense. First off, there wouldn't be much excitement, it'd be mainly conversational scenes and such, and two, there isn't much of an antagonist until they get to the lonely mountain to Smaug. I get that ""Holy shit, this isn't the fucking movie! This isn't what happened in the book, this movie fucking sucks!"" It irks me too, and I'm a huge LOTR fan. But in terms of an audience, and appealing to audiences who have never read the Hobbit as well, it needs to be entertaining. It at least keeps your attention and doesn't bore you to death, and that's what a movie should do. A movie that is just downright laughable, (opinionated) most don't have the motivation to keep watching because it lacks intrigue.

Peter Jackson took a lot of these ""extra"" things from the appendixes of the book and put them into the movie. I'm bantering aimlessly, but people should understand that a movie can never be perfect, and always has flaws. As much as this makes me cringe, I still enjoy the movie regardless.",2014-11-11T01:36:15.000Z,3

I think he thinks it means make up any old shit and insert it into one of the most beloved stories of recent times. Can`t begin to describe how disappointed this movie adaption has been, especially after the LOTR was done so well, with minimal movie licence excepted. This on the other hand feels like a exploitative rape of the book for its good bits with free reign to make up as much bollocks as he sees fit. J.R.R.Tolkien`s the Hobbit is a classic book and i wish it had been treated as such. Look forward to Jackson`s adaption of Dickens next.",2014-11-11T01:07:22.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Personally, as someone who has read, seen, and/or enjoyed both the book and the two film versions of The Hobbit, I think the purists who complain about the films are, for the most part, being very selfish and unreasonable. Just because the movies don't look *exactly* like *your* imagination or match the source material word-for-word, that doesn't automatically mean the movies themselves are bad. Perhaps if someone made their own indie film version of the Middle Earth stories into a niche film for esoteric fantasy-geek communities, would they be satisfied with that? I imagine it might potentially turn into an underground cult favorite, but it wouldn't be nearly as successful as the current film adaptations (by the way, the films were created by an independent film studio, but they were fashioned to appeal to many different people, not just the readers who were already familiar with the stories. This allows non-readers and newcomers to discover the series as well as readers to enjoy the film, and all-in-all, I think the result has been largely positive.) Honestly, I don't think a lot of fans realise just how good this series has it: The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, if they were in the hands of another director and studio, would have probably suffered the same fate as the Dune series (wonderful books, but mediocre film), and that's just one example of a possible alternative outcome.
Some people are so busy picking apart the films for perceived negatives that they miss all the *good* things about the films. I myself take a more positive approach; instead of crying about every single detail that might be missing or changed, I like to either enjoy the books and films as separate stories, or enjoy each version as supplementary to one another. For example, the book is perfect the way it is, but the movies give each dwarf his own unique personality, and that to me adds more intrigue and layers to the story. Sure, the addition of Tauriel as Kili's romantic interest may not have been entirely necessary (and probably somewhat cliche as well), but I don't mind it personally, since it doesn't take away too much from the overall big picture, and I think it's kind of cute -- and yes, I do care enough about the series to be interested in what happens between them in the film. I won't give any spoilers here, but I am curious, not just about Tauriel and Kili, but also about the roles that Galadriel, Saruman, and Elrond will play in the movie, and of course, I want to see how the rest of the story will unfold on screen, because for me, making comparisons between the films and the book is actually fun and interesting. For that, I am very excited about the third film. I agree that, most times, books or source materials are better than the adaptations, but there are occasions when I actually prefer the adaptation over the source material (Forest Gump being one example), and sometimes, the adaptation is nearly equal in quality to the original,

but of course, that's for each individual to decide. As for myself, The Hobbit films are one of the most accurate adaptations to a book that I've ever seen, I mean, almost every event in the book was captured on film, and I for one happen to find that impressive.

People need to understand that books and films are very different mediums, and adaptations of either one will never match the source material 100%; Only in a perfect world would that ever happen. That being said -- especially compared to most adaptive interpretations -- the Peter Jackson adaptation to The Hobbit is actually *very* spot-on in it's accuracy of the plot and the atmosphere described in Tolkien's work, even with the added embellishments to the story (which, in my opinion, don't take away too much from the plot, especially since most of the embellishments are based on actual elements of the whole Middle Earth universe.)

As far as purists being selfish, well, the fact that they act as if the films were made *just* to cater to them is pretty self-centered, and they talk as if the differences between the pages and the film are somehow a personal attack against them or the author. I completely understand and agree with respecting the author's work, but in my opinion., the anti-film critics/fanatics are taking it too far. Some of the same people who complain about the films are probably the same ones who have been demanding a film adaptation for years, but when they finally get one, they just nit-pick and complain about the smallest details (sounds pretty ungrateful to me.) On top of that, some fans act high-and-mighty just because they prefer the books and hate the movies, and that's just pretentious and arrogant. There's just no pleasing some people, unfortunately...

Anyway, if you happen to be a person who personally didn't care for the films, then that's fine, because no one is forcing you to like the movies, and you can just stick with the books if you want. However, it's unreasonable, and childish even, to bemoan every little detail about the film and ruin the cinematic experience for others just because it didn't fit your exact expectations. I also get the impression that people compare the LotR trilogy films with the Hobbit films and expect them to look and sound exactly alike. Newsflash: The Hobbit was originally a children's book, and the tone of the book was more lighthearted and whimsical compared to the Lord of The Rings trilogy, even in book form, so would it not make sense that the Hobbit films would be more comical or whimsical as well? Also, the addition of comic relief in a film does not mean that the whole movie is crass, crude, or juvenile, and the comedy wasn't overdone either -- without it, the filmwould have been much too dark and solemn compared to the source material. I think people who believe that the film is terrible just because some parts of the movie happen to be comical are taking the story too seriously. Even Tolkien's sense of humor wasn't that dry or solemn... Besides, dwarves aren't supposed to be 'elegant' or 'polite', otherwise, they would look more like the elves! If all you got out of the Hobbit films were ""burp jokes,"" then you've missed the point of the story entirely...

Also ridiculous is when fans complain, ""There's too much CGI!"" Obviously, some films overuse CGI and make it into a spectacle in itself, but that is not the case with the LotR and Hobbit films; the CGI is simply a special effect that enhances the visual storytelling. There's nothing inherently 'evil' about it. It is a tool, nothing more. Honestly, most people have no idea how difficult or painstaking it was to create realistic-looking visual effects without modern CGI or digital enhancement, and the advancement of digital/CGI technology would progress even more slowly if people like Peter Jackson did not push the limits of special effects. In fact, without the CGI, the films would be unrecognizable, and as a result of technological limitations, even *more* scenes would have to be cut out of the film, because the action or scenery would not be practically feasible! The Peter Jackson adaptations happen to make great use of practical effects -- the prosthetics, lighting, and make-up are excellent, and the miniatures, costumes, and sets are complex in craftsmanship, and they even filmed on location with beautiful landscapes as the backdrop! But practical effects can only go so far when filming a fantasy or science fiction of this magnitude (even Star Wars was produced with homemade computers to generate some of the special effects.) Not only that, but a project of this size would mean that if every single aspect of the film relied heavily on practical effects (with little to no digital or CGI enhancement), the budget would have to be astronomical to provide for all material tools. Without high-quality computer/digital enhancements, the films would look more like a BBC special instead of a grandiose cinematic adaptation, and to be honest, I think I would be a little more disappointed in the former option. The argument that the film has ""too much CGI"" happens to be a very subjective one, but then again, whether someone enjoys the films or the books is, in the end, subjective in itself.
And honestly, who could say anything unfavorable about the soundtrack? The music to the films are a lovely addition to the immersive fantasy epic, and it truly captures the magic of Middle Earth! [Okay, I can understand why some people weren't exactly pleased with the addition of Ed Sheeran's ""I See Fire"" for the end credits, but I don't think the song is that bad, and the song or artist choice could have been a lot worse, to be honest.]

How would J.R.R. Tolkien feel about the films? Well, no one can know for sure, since he has been deceased for decades, but as far as I can tell from biographies about him (and his reaction to a theatrical version of The Hobbit), I think that he would have been largely impressed. Sure, he would have frowned at some of the embellishments or changes to the plot or story, but I'm also convinced that all other aspects of the film would have amazed him greatly, and he would be pleased at how closely the films capture the magic of the epic story and the atmosphere. For example, prior adaptations of his work have interpreted the dwarves as garden gnome-like creatures, but the films more closely represent the rough-and-tough fighters that the dwarves were described as being in the Middle Earth universe. Also, prior adaptations have greatly simplified the plot of The Hobbit, whereas the film trilogy was able to tell the whole story, with room for embellishment, and a greater connection to the rest of the Middle Earth universe! [Most notably, the Rankin-Bass 1977 animation left out and changed many aspects of the story, not to mention that this version essentially killed off even more of the dwarves than the book itself! And in this version, the elves looked more like imps instead of the elegant, regal, and powerful people described in Tolkien's work and the Wingnut films. In some respects, the animated version was more accurate to the book, but for the most part, it was a rather simplistic, and arguably darker retelling of the story.]
Personally, I like to think of it in much the same way as a folk tale or piece of mythology: with each storyteller, the story changes little by little, and I like to think that's what happened here. I like to think that the people at Wingnut Films studio were as faithful to the book and its respective fictional universe as any large-scale film adaptation could get.
Anyway, I just think that a lot of fans could save themselves from unneeded stress if they would lighten up a bit and assess things more logically and with an open mind. If you didn't like the movies, that's fine and you are entitled to your own opinion, but that's no reason to try to ruin it for others. Regardless, I'll be enjoying the books *and* the films whether certain people like it or not. Life is too short to spend it on irrational bitterness and negativity. I think the films are great the way they are, and as much as I respect and admire Tolkien's work, I don't think I could have done it any better justice if I were a film director. I'm just grateful that someone has beautifully rendered a film series that has brought to life on the big-screen such awe-inspiring, legendary epics that will continue to inspire generations to come.

If someone told me that they didn't like the movie after watching it, I wouldn't freak out or insult them, or say things like, ""You're just an ignoramus who doesn't appreciate good cinema!"" What I would do instead is ask them, ""Really? What is it about the film that you didn't like?"" and depending on their answer, I would decide for myself if their reasons are valid or informed. If, for example, they explain specific things that displeased them, then their personal interpretation holds more support and I would respect their opinion even if I disagree.
But, if their answer is more like, ""It was crap! Pure garbage! Nothing like the book at all! Peter Jackson should die!"" well then of course, I'm less likely to take their opinion seriously.

My theory is that many fans, especially those who hold a lot of nostalgia for the book, are stuck in their own interpretation of the story, and as a result, they are unable to enjoy someone else's interpretation, no matter how technically well-done it may be. When someone goes into something with strong expectations rooted firmly in their own imagination, then that's a recipe for disappointment. Speaking for myself, though, I enjoy both book and film for what they are, and I personally find that the film does justice to the book very well. That's the thing about books though: everyone has their own interpretation. Even movies from original screenplays are open to a wide diversity of interpretation and opinion (especially when remakes/reboots are involved.) As I've stated before, if you don't particularly enjoy the films, that's *okay*, because we don't all have to like the same thing, but there's hardly any reason to be so negative or defensive about it. *If you like it, great! If not, that's fine too!* Just don't act like a pretentious snob or a rude jerk about your opinion, because the attitude really isn't necessary. In the end, whether or not someone appreciates or enjoys the films is a subjective matter, but at least try to have some informed logic or reason behind your opinion. That's all I'm saying.

Ah, but maybe my approach might be a bit too academic or scholarly to be realistic. Only in a perfect world would everyone express their opinion in an informed, mature, and civilized manner. Oh well, at least I can say that I've tried to be sensible on a subjective topic...

If you've made it to the end of my essay, then I thank you for your patience and attention. Hopefully, I've said enough to support my own opinion here.  ",2014-11-10T09:49:07.000Z,5

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I personally believe that the movies are better than the book, mostly because there were some very good changes. In the book, Azog was only mentioned once, and in the movies, he's one of the main villains. It gives it more of an epic effect. Tauriel is also a very cool change. Although it wasn't necessary, it did bring in another female character, and there aren't many of them, especially badass ones. I also love the whole Dol Guldur situation, if I remember right that didn't happen in the book. This is just my opinion. ",2014-11-09T14:33:55.000Z,259

It would fully redeem the terrible way the trilogy has depicted his character. 

During his trip, he could realise just how uncool a bunny sled is, and finally have him look in a mirror and see the birdshit in his hair so he can get rid of it.

Then finish with a comedy scene where Saruman and Gandalf turn up and make him all paranoid, but with it all turning out well when Galadriel takes a few with him, and they both end up dancing naked among the flowers.

The Shining film for example is literally 50% different than that of The Stephen King Novel. This book cannot be done in one film,It could have concluded during the sequel,but I highly doubt that any fans of what Peter Jackson has done to the myth of Tolkien's world will be dissapointed with a long drawn out franchise/trilogy.

This movie looks awesome sure I wasn't the biggest fan of the first movie but it appears that Peter Jackson is learning from his mistakes and that the following movies are going to be better, the second movie is proof of that. Also the sets (although mostly CGI) looks pretty cool and the fight scenes look well choreographed. I like how amazing and in sync all the elves are when they draw their bows (I don't know if it's just me but it really pisses me off when something like that is done sloppily so this made me very happy). I am really excited for this and I hope that it will be as epic as the last Lord of the Rings movie.

Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.” 

 I just can't. To...to....to sad :'( Why must they die!!!! WHY. It's one thing for a character to die in a book. Its sad but its different in a film. They seem more real simply because you can put a face to a name. To make matters worse the actors playing those characters do a amazing job so there's another emotional level added.  It doesn't  help that Howard Shore is doing the music. I am sure that whatever melody is playing at that certain part is going to make the scene even more tragic. Ugh. The one movie I will cry at. I honestly think the level of tragedy, angst and sadness will be tenfold compared to Return of the King. this soundtrack list is sad enough.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Why is it that every director feels the need to mutilate a great story when adapting it to film? I understand most (not all) of the changes made to the LOTR trilogy, but this? So many unnecessary changes and additions that it warps the original story almost beyond recognition. The hobbit (and the LOTR trilogy) was more than just a story, it was THE story. Tolkien poured most of his life into them and created a world so rich and vast that I don't think anyone will ever surpass it. These movies in my opinion shit all over his work. Initially I was really excited when I heard Jackson wanted to include some elements from the Appendices and other works, but as soon as I watched the first movie I knew it was just a cash cow. These films reek of Hollywood, which to me is a huge disappointment as these stories have been a big part of me for a long time. Adding characters that didn't exist or were supposed to be dead, altering characters personalities, creating ridiculous love triangles, unnecessary action sequences, rushed character development (Bilbo), inaccurate portrayal of characters (Thorin is supposed to be really old, but instead got the Hollywood ""pretty boy"" makeover), and over the top special effects that make it look like I'm playing a video game. On top of that, it really fails to capture the feel of middle earth which is one thing I felt the LOTR trilogy did very well. I guess I could keep going but in the end I'm just ranting in the comments section on YouTube.

There were boring sequences and the battle of the five armies was underwhelming and very undescriptive. Jackson's changes are acceptable in the fact that the continuity remains steady, mostly. I agree with people how Tauriel sort of fucks up everything in the sense that she doesn't have any relation to the LOTR. I think Jackson has done an amazing job but I have to warn him. Be careful with Tauriel, if you mess her up your fuck up the continuity and everything's gonna go to shit. Also Thranduil kills her at 1:52, so there you go",2014-11-08T19:18:01.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"There is a lot of hate her on Jackson. :O To all people trying to be smart because they have read book for kids - Try to find out a bit more about Tolkien's universe and read more of his books that just lotr and hobbit, if you want to whine about it. Jackson takes into movie parts that weren't in the Hobbit book, like White Council, Dol Guldur, Sauron etc. because it happened in pretty much same time as a standard Hobbit plot, which Tolkien puts in other books. That is why it is 9 hours of movies. If PJ would just do exactly what The Hobbit book contains we would have movie for 10 yrs old, let's face it. This book is good, it is pleasant to read but it is not even close to lotr trilogy, as Tolkien was aware, yet Jackson managed to make it a very good prequel for lotr.
He obviously changes some facts, as he did in lotr (or just throwing them away) but in my opinion it is healthy for the movie. He made lotr much more dynamic than book really is. He had to miss some parts, but the choices were very good e.g. Bombadil - it would take a lot of time, yet brings nothing to the plot. Sometimes he even manages to express things better than even Tolkien did e.g. when Theoden gets healed by Gandalf - that is just pure genius depsite being totally out of the book.
The point is that he made the Hobbit much better that it could have been if someone made exactly as the book says and as a Tolkien fan I personally love it. My only problem is the way Gandalf is made - he is pretty much as powerful as Sauron, and deifnitely not less than Saruman, yet he seems like just an old guy who gets knocked everytime he is facing a real enemy. Even Galadriel looks superior to him, even though he is - as Maya - a higher level of being. Tolkien made him humble though so probably that's what Jackson is doing, but in my opinion he exaggerates a lot",2014-11-08T14:33:29.000Z,0

I know it doesn't happen in the book but it really wouldn't bother me. He is every bit as greedy as he accuses the dwarves of being and would happily wipe them out so he can get his hands on a handful of gems. Even in the book his presence before the battle begins only makes things worse - Thorin quite clearly tells Bard that he will not barter in the presence of his enemy so come back the next day without the elves and then they will negotiate reparations for the people of lake-town. Bard and Thranduil refuse so Thorin turns them away. If Thranduil doesn't die then Gandalf, Galadriel or Elrond need to be present to take him down a peg or ten.",2014-11-08T12:21:51.000Z,1

Peter Jackson - one of the best directors. I love his movies and for those who say that it spoils the book (by the way, I've read it too many times and I like it), I say:

The book and the film - incomparable things. When shooting movies always have to make any changes. Always. And more so, the film - it's not a literal retelling of the book. This is her adaptation. I do not deny that they have bad points, but the changes that have been made in ""The Hobbit"" for the most part for the better, in my opinion.

I like both books and movies. Many thanks for the trailer and all who took part in the filming of these movies!",2014-11-08T12:04:31.000Z,2

I really like the style of the movie how John Howe and Alan Lee designed it and how Peter Jackson filmed it. Still a big compliment. This movie should not be only strictley for the fans but for every one just like mr Tolkiens books. Hé wrote it for you nog and old. 
There is not a single movie based on a book out there which is true to its story. Its really hard to film every page and dialog. Almost impossible so thats when you need to be creative and try to stick true to the books as best as possible. I truely believe mr Jackson did that. ",2014-11-08T11:52:00.000Z,3

They reuse characters and phrases to create a (fictional) link between LOTR and the Hobbit. They adapt the storyline to EVEN MORE epicness (especially Gandalf). Just take a look at the extended version of the Hobbit if you want more about the story. 
Furthermore this battle is so gonna kick the shit out of every fight scene in the series so far. I only hope they continue this epicness with an additional 10 (?) movies about the Silmarillion.

But it may be a good change, LOTR was AMAZING and the other two hobbit films were OK, but this still might be the lucky shot for the hobbit trilogy. 

And I actually hope this is good, cuz then if the Tolkien publishing company like it, peter Jackson will get the rights to direct the silmarillion. :)",2014-11-08T07:56:10.000Z,9

He actually tried to rewrite the Hobbit to make it more epic, to make it feel more like part of the whole, but he failed to do so, in the end.

Well Tolkien never lived to see the movies, but his estate is making boatloads of money, so Tolkien probably isn't spinning in his grave over the way Peter Jackson has butchered The Hobbit. But anyone who loves the book should be cringing right about now.",2014-11-08T02:40:09.000Z,0

I recognize that movies will be different, of course they have to be.  Anyone remember the old cartoon version of The Hobbit?  But still, the new books irritate me.",2014-11-08T02:21:42.000Z,1

Yes, Jackson turned a relatively short book in to three films. He also added a lot of stuff from the appendices, which I think is a huge improvement. Gandalf just saying 'well, I'm off' like he did in the book would be absolutely terrible. Legolas being in the films is just a logical thing. The love triangle I could do without, but I actually liked Tauriel's character. The dwarves are recognisable, and not just because of different colours of hats. Fighting Smaug might have been lengthy and not in the book, but it was entertaining enough for me. And at least we get to see things such as the White Council, the Ring having an influence on Bilbo, Gandalf's reasons for joining the quest. One of the main flaws of the book was introducing Bard at the exact time he was needed. So yes, I liked the Esgaroth politics, they clearly served a purpose. The barrel scene was just absolutely amazing. So yes, I actually like most changes Jackson has made to the Hobbit and practically all changes he made to The Lord of the Rings.

Yes, there is a lot of CGI, but you can't expect them not to use it for creating armies, various creatures and scenery (the city of Erebor, laketown on fire etc) without using CGI. It would be impossible.
The elves do look the same if you pause the shot, they are CGI, it couldn't have hurt to get a few more actors, but it lasts about 2 seconds and elves (especially the minor elves) are known for being similar, moving together perfectly. There isn't much of a problem apart from people bothered about every. single. frame. You have to accept things can't always be real in films now, especially since this is such a long film.
You have to remember it is in 3D. They can't use the non-cgi tricks from Lotr, it doesn't WORK. So cgi is now the alternative for making height differences etc. which I think works well. Also, dressing up actors in full prosthetics is very difficult for them, but PETER JACKSON TRIED IT, BUT IT DIDN'T WORK SO THEY USED MOTION CAPTURE.
Many forget lots of extra content is taken out of the appendices not just the actual book of the hobbit, since many things are uneventful and unsuitable for movies.

Nonetheless, where did their 2 billion dollar budget go? I think this notion of ""the future"" is very misconstrued by the illusion of CGI's advancement to the entire film industry. When on the downside, CGI allows for an artificial substitution of real actors and costumiers. Sure, more revenue means people lose opportunities or preexisting jobs in the process, but hey, the upper class has got to be paid one way or another. THAT'S WHY THERE IS SUCH AN INEQUALITY GAP AND MISTRUST BETWEEN THE UPPER AND THE MERGED MIDDLE/POOR CLASSES. The ""traditional"" lifestyle might've been less appealing, but this thoughtless adaption to technology is ruining our economic infrastructure by marginalizing the lower classes.

Like many social sciences, they're not exact. However, the likely reason for this is because people don't like feeling that they're just part of the crowd. So a person may like something like a movie, book, song, etc. Then more people start to like it. Eventually the thing gets so popular the person who originally liked it convinces them self (subconsciously) that they hate it because they want to feel that they're more of an independent thinker. This often coincides with a cognitive biased where whenever a person is convinced of one thing, they dismiss any evidence that challenges their opinion and only excepts what supports it.",2014-11-07T23:47:29.000Z,37

That's been the problem with this three movie Ode to Peter Jackson's Ego. Couldn't we just have had one or maybe two movies telling the story from the book instead of having a mish mash from other sources and implied happenings tossed in like some frou frou gormet salad?

The Lord of the RIngs movies were good precisely because they mostly followed the books. Peter Jackson is a great film maker, but he's not a great fantasy writer, thus the author of the books these movies are supposed to be based on is J.R.R. Tolkien and not him. He'd do better sticking closer to the source material. Even with the slightly cheesy animation, the Rankin Bass movie version of The Hobbit was a more coherent telling of the actual story. ",2014-11-07T23:44:18.000Z,0

Now, I wish it had never happened. Jackson completely and utterly ruined it, from the tone to adding characters in that weren't even in the book. This could have been done with two movies at the most, but three??? People talk about how Jackson and his writers are ""The perfect people to adapt this book""... I wonder if they even read it, it was not this dark, not at all! Even in the first film, when Bilbo faced off against that albino Orc ( also not in the book ), that would never have happened! The Barrel ride? Ridiculous!!! The whole point was that Bilbo used stealth to smuggle the dwarves out unnoticed! Complete and utter Hollywood garbage. This was Peter's chance to do another LOTR, pure and simple. So much talk about doing this for the fans, I disagree... more like selling out. Maybe in enough time, someone will come back and adapt it properly, and not with their self-important posturing.

I had real faith in Jackson, but to tell the truth I wonder now how he managed to do so well with the LOTR trilogy. 

Yet another adaptation that fell short. I hope he is never allowed to touch another Tolkien story again.",2014-11-07T21:30:25.000Z,14

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD]," Will everyone ,for the love of God, stop complaining about the CGI. When The Lord of the Rings ended Peter Jackson said that, ""This is the end."" Which means they were not going to make Hobbit movies. But every fan of them was pleading for Hobbit movies and they heard us. So Peter Jackson went and made The Hobbit Trilogy.
 
 So instead of complaining that it has CGI in it and that he added a few things to it, we should all just be thankful that he even made Hobbit movies because he wasn't going to in the first place. Because all of you pleaded to him to make them. So when he actually makes them you all wine about them.

 I believe true fans of The Hobbit and Tolkien's works would like The Hobbit of what it is and its beautiful story and theme. And if they add a few extra characters or if they add some CGI to some stuff, so what. It does not ruin the story in anyway. All of these complainers and what they are saying are going against everything Tolkien believed, of what he put in his stories and what he wanted for the world.   The Hobbit can't be and look like The Lord of the Rings because of the 13 years or so they are separated. For me I am very excited to see this wonderful last movie.

 So please, just be thankful for these wonderful movies and just enjoy what The Hobbit is and that we even got any movies at all.       ",2014-11-07T18:06:17.000Z,24

Also I hope people stop bitching already about the using of CGI in Hobbit movies, get over it ffs it looks awesome.

Sure I loved that LOTR used it less, but why don't you just enjoy the darn trailer.
95% of movies these days use CGI so it's understandable, so stop f*cking whining!",2014-11-07T18:00:34.000Z,0

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"All right.. but I can't see the Dwarven army - only Elves and Orcs. I've seen enough of that in LOTR movies.. lots and lots of Elves and Orcs. And here we should have at least 500 Dwarven Warriors from Iron Hills - grim, tough, stout short dudes heavily clad in iron mail and boots. Not some merry fairies but serious, battle worn killers with heavy axes- no less than portrayed by Tolkien and he made it pretty clear that these dudes mean business. If the show will be run by the Elves again with their sneaky ninja ways and shiny, gay armor, I'm going to explode on my sit in movie theater.. Of course - I've got nothing against Elves and the battle is not what attracted me to the story, I wish there was less combat, more wandering and adventures - just like in the book. But I understand that what's cool to read may not necessarily work on the screen. However, this is an adaptation, core facts have to be preserved and since the movie's called The Battle of Five Armies and the Dwarves are in the center of the story, I expect that to be respected.",2014-11-07T17:45:08.000Z,2

But sometimes when they are outside, the colourgrading and lighting makes it look awful, so unrealistic. It is so bright even when they are inside the mountain it is so obvious that they have big electric lamps right in the actors faces. It pulls me out of the movie sometimes, it should be really dark inside that mountain. And it should be real colours outside not overly saturated colours, because it looks like World of Warcraft or some other video game and not like Middle Earth from the LOTR.

This whole picture is computer generated, there is nothing real about it, no tree, no mountain no face and I guess thats how 90% of the movie will look like. You don't have to fly all the way to New Zealand for this bullshit. This is no freaking computer game, this is supposed to be a movie that many of us have waiter for a long long time. Its just disappointing as fuck to see this, even Viggo Mortensen said it. I understand if you make a Balrog CGI but can't you at least get 10 elves in costumes for the front row? Is this to much to ask for a 2 Billion Dollar Budged?? I'm just glad LOTR was made 12 years earlier where it was still cheaper to put on costumes sometimes and use real actors, if it was made today by Peter he would have ruined it as well with his fetish for new technology.  ",2014-11-07T09:40:42.000Z,188

I hope they'll fix it until the premiere, since it's only a month. Jackson's gotten way too greedy with it, he's using it for stuff like goblins/orcs (which is better using people in make-up) and even on locations (he puts green screens around the actors to use the same surroundings that's behind the green screens, but slightly to the left or right) And wow, all that filler crap. I feel that the movies suffered going from two to three movies, because it meant that Jackson had to come up with even more fanfiction, and fast too, which resulted in for example the dreadful Dragon vs Dwarves scenes in the last one.

Also it's sad that you apparently can't critizice the movies/trailers without being called trolls by people violently defending Jackson, and I feel that the only do that because he also did LOTR.",2014-11-07T06:51:54.000Z,2

I honestly can't wait for the movie, I'm going to re-read the book before the movie comes out. I know Peter Jackson deviated a lot from the book, but I don't care, the lord of the rings films deviated a lot from the novels as well. Though The Hobbit trilogy doesn't meet the heights of the Lord of the Rings, it has become a great blockbuster with fun action and emotion story arcs, therefore, they are still great, fun and enjoyable films to me. I will probably sob at the end of the movie, I grew up with Middle - Earth, my first theatre experience was when I was  5 and "" The Fellowship of the Ring"" came out, my parents couldn't find me a baby sitter so they tagged me along, I watched the movie with them and I loved it!  I read all the books later when I was older, like around my freshman year! But overall, I'm excited for this! The adrenaline is just too much right now! Lol ",2014-11-07T05:09:06.000Z,1

Its not like PJ is making Tauriel the saviour of everyone and using her character to change the ending of the story. no, that'd make no sense for its sequel which is LOTR. name any film that is based on a novel which is perfectly accurate as their book. i think it'd be very hard to list down because so far I've only known of a few. so just enjoy the movie :)",2014-11-07T01:11:54.000Z,4

You can't compare it to Lord of the Rings, but on that hand you can't really compare anything to Lord of the Rings. I have 2 and only 2 main problems with the films so far: A little too heavy on the CGI, (I think the orcs should have been costume) and the whole love affair between the elf and the dwarf. Other than that I only have a few gripes that would be easily looked past like wanting Smaug for a bit more. I think the first two films were great.

Tolkien wrote this in 1937; my guess is he would be pretty excited to see how this epic world he envisioned more than 77 years ago became the journey Peter Jackson re-invisioned for the screen. If nothing else, he would probably be blown away by Jackson's 20 year commitment to breathing life into those pages and The Lord of the Rings. And he would probably invite you along to enjoy the ride and ask you to reserve judgment until the end of the experience.

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I've got to admit that there might be a bit too much CGI in this trailer (did all the elves and orcs had to be CG on the close ups ?).

But god damn it, when you look at it, the CGI is just great ! I mean Erebor feels real as hell (both from inside and outside), the landscapes are stunning, it is impossible to tell wether some sets are extended with the green screen tech or not and if so, what part of the set is real and what part is fake (which is, I think, the main difference with the Star Wars prequels regarding CGI), the wide army shots look 100x times better than those from LotR, Laketown was impressive in DoS (looks even better when burning) and hell even Azog looks stuningly realistic and scary on the close-up we get from him !

So right, the CGI might be overused for characters, but for landscapes, wide shots, epic shots, set extensions... it looks sooooo great ! I'd go as far as to say that the CG version of many sets looks better and more realistic than the models we had in LotR (Laketown, one of the most realistic CG cities ever made, Rivendell looks better in AUJ then in LotR and Erebor is just stunning... Looks more realistic and has way more details than Moria !) 

All this to say : please guys stop complaining about CGI, it brings soo much into the movie !",2014-11-06T22:05:49.000Z,3

The character development looks absolutely amazing (especially Thorin's), I felt emotionally connected with all of these characters simply after watching a 2:33 video. The battle scenes look intense. The scene with Gandalf/Saruman/Galadriel/Elrond/SAURON! looks amazing! The whole film looks a masterpiece. But the one thing that makes me feel sad is... the fact that this is the last time Middle-Earth will appear on the big screen. Now, I know this sounds overly nerdy and lame but... that's the only thing I could think of when watching this!

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"I hate people who complain about movies not being like the books they were made after to be to busy nerd raging to understand how movies are made. Jackson said originally NONE of the movies would be exactly like the books because it would be impossible to fit it into a movie unless you want to a billion movies. Which I wouldn't mind but to the normal movie goer they don't want to see The Hobbit: Part 23. BTW I am a massive LOTR/Hobbit fan.

So I accept that almost all movies based on books (or anything else) aren't often accurate. Just like many don't like that Transformers (for example) aren't like the series. I don't mind. They are meant to be brainless action flicks. I'm just glad to see Transformers on a big screen no matter the changes or how cheesy the story is. 

Which is why I say some things in summary:
1. If you don't like it, don' see it.
2. Unless you can make a better version of it then be grateful it even became a film. ",2014-11-06T19:48:03.000Z,42

2.Why are the Nazgûl like those ghost-like things and why don't they attack Galadriel... is she really strong enough to keep them all away and rescue Gandalf?
3.Does Saruman here already gets a jerkface?
4.Why the fuck do the dwarfs of the Iron Hills carry these huge Balistas if they had to make haste and needed to take rams for getting to the Erebor as fast as possible?
5.I like the mounted troll catapults but I think it's a bit over the top isn't it?
6.Are those fat little troll-like things Bolg's Bodyguards or are they half-trolls?
7.Dose Azog now not even have one hand? Because he have this blade like thing in his onther arm

Looks epic, looks like it's filled with more emotion in which always insures a good movie. Peter Jackson is one of the best there is and used new technology to which looks fine tuned by the end, definitely get the extended editions, DOS Ex is way better than the theatre cut.

CGI never bothered me, it stretches what a regular person is capable of doing. An example of why I sometimes prefer CGI is Underworld. Granted it's an older series, but the werewolves in the earlier films were just people in kind of crappy wolf costumes. Mouths didn't move, claws flailed around like rubber, it totally pulls you out of the immersive feel of the movie. Granted it's my personal opinion that this CGI looks good and it works for me, which may not be the case for everyone. But could you imagine building a cave troll suit and having it be partly mechanical, puppet controlled facial expressions, or something. It would be clunky, noticeable, and couldn't get the wear and tear that CGI characters go through.",2014-11-06T18:44:53.000Z,40

2014-11-06T18:00:00.000Z,iVAgTiBrrDA,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies - Official Main Trailer [HD],"Now I see what Jackson meant about this being the most emotional and biggest of the 6 films. I mean I tear up almost every time I finish watching the LOTR trilogy, but I was internally tearing up just at this trailer. Some of that dialogue was freaking emotional. As the first trailer was a little bit of a let down for me, this exceeded my expectations. My only problem is that some of the CGi looks unfinished but I know that they aren't completely done with the post production yet so it'll probably look better in the final film. Can't wait.

All I can say is ""We come to it at last, the great trailer of our time.""",2014-11-06T18:34:29.000Z,6

Fili is still the heir to the throne. He is the oldest and he should have more relevant scenes given to him - more scenes where he's not just a prop or a crutch for the progression of Kíli's development.",2014-11-06T18:13:48.000Z,6
