2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,"it is really amazing 2 see all the people that are brainwashed and blinded by the truth behind this movie... This movie has the number 6 as the main number of the entire movie...(?????)

if the Book of Revelations in the Bible says that people will be forced to have the mark of the beast 666... Isn't this groundwork for the young kids who are going to grow up to be old decision-making men and women?

when does it stop being conspiracy and start being reality?(think about it)

you constantly see images of people showing only one eye... Everybody knows that symbol is  for the Illuminati ....these are  subliminal attacks... Smart scientists know about the subconscious mind and how important it is to the decision-making of a human being... (values and beliefs )

so if the Bible is correct in predicting this indoctrination of the number 6 and the mark of the beast... then what else is it the Bible correct about?

I am a former atheist who did not believe in anything much less Jesus Christ... However doing some research and seeing what I'm seeing in the world with the Illuminati indoctrination of subliminal messaging... It can only lead me to conclude that Jesus Christ really is the truth!

here's another logic piece for you... People who worship Satan and do Satanic rituals... Are always using upside down crosses and being Antichrist... You never see them using upside down Buddhas or Mohammad... They do not mock any other religion except Christianity

people hate religion because of wars that are created because of it... However Jesus Christ has nothing to do with the decisions of man and the lies man tells other men for the reasons they go to war... men making their own decisions and being evil is on them just because they say they're doing it behind some religious cause doesn't mean that Jesus Christ approves of what they are doing...

any parents reading this understand that your children's subconscious mind is under ""attack"" for lack of a better word... and you need to see the logic when it comes to your belief system... You have nothing to lose and everything to gain believing in Jesus Christ! it's simple logic",2017-01-13T22:10:52.000Z,0

In fact, I might have gone to see BH6 in cinemas if it wasn't for this trailer. I originally thought it was a story about a boy going through puberty, and that was the whole focus. I think it was the second trailer where it said diagnosis puberty and that's why I thought that. But anyway this trailer is horrible in my opinion because it shows the entire police station scene and I don't think it shows off the movie enough.

I just don't get it.  I think everyone commenting must be part of some huge tween fanbase that emerged from nowhere or something.  But, maybe when I see it, I'll think it's fantastic, who knows.  To me, the trailers just really don't seem interesting at all.",2015-03-29T17:30:39.000Z,0

Nobody looks at the messages in a movie anymore, this movie is preparing our culture to try to become better god's than we currently are... lol, and teaching us that in order to ascend into a greater evolved self, that we need upgrades... I wish i could make this up but the only God, totally predicted this would happen (among other predictions that came to pass) and recorded the last time this happened culturally... humanity became pretty evil and God in his mercy had to destroy it in a world-wide flood to save Noah and family and all future generations born into the then (and now) unforgiving and evil world. You are told of all the nice things technology gives us but nobody considers all the terrible things we will do with it. Holographic sex doll anyone? Or if your grandpa was Hitler and someone uploaded him into the internet maybe he gets downloaded into a nice robot. My concern here is not technology itself, I believe we're just wanting it so to cheat death and keep sinning, not being accountable to God but BEING God. The wages of sin is death, and through Christ Yeshua (Jesus) you can live. But mark not my word but God's Word; we're not going to be allowed to live forever with or without technology apart from Jesus. God said ""My Spirit will not contend with man forever"" Gensesis 6:3. I'm not judging you for watching or even enjoying the movies, I just don't want people to be deceived. Your probably thinking i'm totally deceived too. That's ok but please don't hate me! Or say i'm being ""intolerance"" and then become totally intolerant of me. But when your kid begins to hate himself because he's not as good as all the superhero's he sees in every kids show or as big as the school bully, just tell him he'll get an upgrade one day. We don't need technology near as much as we need Jesus, our moral example and creator. Don't you think that he would know what would or wouldn't make us 'better'? Anyway, i'm not trying to convert anyone, I'm completely incapable of changing anyone's beliefs no matter how much I write here, that's a matter between you and God who says, ""I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh..."" Ezekial 36:26. I'm just saying we should seek truth for ourselves and not believe everything Disney or Microsoft or Nasa is telling us.",2015-02-25T04:01:51.000Z,0

Okay, beautiful graphics, animation not that bad, could have been better though, looking on the moves. But this story ! Ar, why can't you see how boring that was ?! Why did Disney win for the long and the short animated movie while neither of both deserved it ? Let's make that clear, I like Disney... well I used to, when they were good, but these last years, except for Paperman, which was a masterpiece, it has been so lame. I guess this is all about money. I've seen all the animated movies that were in the nominees and this was the worse of them. I mean, did you guys see the wonderful work they did on the Boxtrolls, or Kaguya ? And what about HTTYD 2 ! A wonderful piece of art. Big Hero 6 has Baymax, only good point. The others characters are flat, the story is full of clichés, another orphan, like always, the animation is good but lacks depth... it's way less aesthetic than Frozen (which story was already bad, btw).

Frozen is just a repeat of the plotline in The Lion King with superpowers. It doesn't teach us much of anything. But Big Hero 6, you can relate to it and it has lessons. Losing a loved one, being misunderstood, even if you are an outcast or a nerd that doesn't mean you can be something great, follow your dreams, if you fail, just try again. Maybe if Frozen weren't so overrated and paid attention to, then maybe Big Hero 6 would get the attentionit needs to have. :)",2015-02-22T21:24:59.000Z,0

It is also the most advanced it took a lot of designing and they built a actual robot to test movement this film took a lot of effort which some people don't see. If you go in the studio you see how advanced and technical this was. If you reached the end of this comment thank you ,2015-02-18T08:31:05.000Z,0

1. Big hero 6 is the first Disney Original (im not talking pixar here people) movie that doesnt invole any princess of some sort

2. Big hero 6 is the only Disney Original that the main character is a boy

3. Big hero 6 is one of of the rarely made movies that the idea of the story can actually happen in real life aka u can create ur own baymax if ur a genuis ur parents and brother die and u can be a half Japanese 14 year old boy that never brushes his hair

2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,"This movie is insanely good. I'd rate it 5/5. The comedy is good, animation (as always by disney) is brilliant, story is great and it consists of several memorable moments. There's everything for everyone. If you enjoyed Wreck it Ralph, you WILL enjoy this movie.

All the hate is coming from ignorant dickheads who adored the fucking shit FROZEN. No it doesn't have gay songs like ""do you want to build a snowman"" and ""let it go"". This movie doesnt need songs or any talking snowman. The overhype of Frozen is what leads to dissapointment for other Disney movies. Big Hero 6 doesn't need fancy princesses and two sisters who don't know what the world is about. Just ""let it go"" and watch this movie.

Frozen - 4/10, Big Hero 6 - 10/10. Just saying..

2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,Idk why but big hero 6 is my fav movie because of how geeky and nerdy and way less crap then frozen! My fav character is Hiro because he is dealing with so much just to help and has some sort of personality and it's a nerdy good one. The biggest things he is dealing with is 1. Puberty 2. Emotional trauma from loss of his brother and 3. He has college. He has to put all this aside so he can help and plus another reason why I like him is because doesn't do much but he's excitable and he tries to help. Over all very cool disney thing and so non disney like talking about puberty and super hero's and sciency stuff but that's why I like... It's a new weird addition because it's actually marvel!,2015-01-03T12:44:23.000Z,0

Honestly, I avoided everything that had to do with BH6 (I had nothing against the film, I just didn't really pay attention to the film.) When I saw went to the theatre, I was expecting just a fun and cliche kids movie which would get a lot of praise because it was created by a high animation studio, when in reality it didn't deserve praise (like Frozen :) )
BOY WAS I WRONG! I will admit, there were parts that were cliche, but this film, unlike Frozen, really pulled my heart strings and had pure emotion. As a younger sister, Hiro's relationship with Tadashi throughout the film really resonated with me and left me in tears towards the end...And I haven't cried during a movie since The Pursuit of Happyness.

Take a look at their faces, they all have the exact same shape, with ridiculously huge eyes, cute little noses and a tiny little mouth. Even their body types are all the same. Boys on the other hand are allowed to look different, have big noses, differently shaped faces and a unique physique. 
Giving your female characters different hairstyles and clothes is NOT helping the fact that they are mere clones. That is what I call lazy character design. If they can´t think of a way to create likeable and unique women without submitting to our societys´ crazy beauty standards, then they fucked up big time. 
Like, what are they trying to teach children here? I regularly see my 8 year old sister standing in front of the mirror and crying because ""her nose is too big"" since we watched fucking frozen. Seriously, get your lazy fucking ass up and go for some more creative and diverse character designs so i can let my sis watch movies that don´t subtextual tell her she has to look like one of these horrible female copies.

Cuando un devastador acontecimiento azota a la ciudad de San Fransokyo y catapulta a Hiro al centro del peligro, Hiro recurre a Baymax y a sus amigos más cercanos: la adicta a la adrenalina Go Go Tomago (voz de Jamie Chung), el fanático de la limpieza Wasabi (voz de Damon Wayans Jr.), la genio de la química Honey Lemon (voz de Génesis Rodriguez) y el fanático Fred (voz de T.J. Miller). Decidido a resolver el misterio, Hiro transforma a sus amigos en una liga de héroes de alta tecnología llamada “Big Hero 6”. Inspirada en el cómic de Marvel del mismo nombre, y con increíbles escenas de acción y todo el corazón y el humor que el público espera de Walt Disney Animation Studios, “Big Hero 6” fue dirigida por Don Hall (“Winnie the Pooh”) y Chris Williams (“Bolt”), y producida por Roy Conli (“Tangled”).",2014-12-06T00:22:34.000Z,0

The whole sibling relationship, the occasional acting out and getting into trouble with the rules of society. I looked up to my sister growing up, but she let me down with her decisions growing up. And it did feel lonely not having full parentship, it was hard for me to ever feel  open to strangers. The death of Hero's brother was so essential, it represented the lost connection I felt with my sister when she started focusing more on her life. It wasn't all cute and funny, it had an incredible development throughout the film. I can't wait to share Walt Disney's wonderful tales to my future children (hopefully 3) because they're influences are imaginative with philosophies we all share dearly. Wonderful work on the one's who participated in the efforts in the makings of this :D",2014-11-20T11:07:59.000Z,0

2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,"Just watched this recently, and felt it was decent. I thought the visual design was pretty impressive, especially the environment. If you live in San Francisco, particularly toward the downtown and Nob/Russian Hill area, you will recognize a lot of the vantage points and buildings used as reference. Not only just the big famous structures, but also smaller buildings. I swear, Hiro's house is based off the La Boulange cafe on Polk St. & Green St.

The Story was okay. It wasn't particularly impressive or complex, but then again, it is targeted toward a younger audience. People seeking a movie with a more serious tone might want to look elsewhere. There is a fair amount of character development, but is limited mostly to the main protagonists: Hiro & Baymax.  Something that slightly bothered me was the character interactions felt a little forced at times especially in the beginning, when they're trying to set all the characters up.

Sound was decent. It was pretty much what you'd expect from a typical Disney movie.

The film takes some obvious inspiration from other movies. I just have to say that the film at times really reminded me of Ironman, especially during Baymax's upgrades. In addition, the flying sequence also felt very familiar to the first ""How To Train Your Dragon,"" I almost thought they were made by same studio. hahaha

Overall, I thought ""How to Train Your Ironman"" was worth my moneys. lols",2014-11-18T04:05:44.000Z,9

BUT
Why does the UK have to wait 2 months after America for it to be released in the cinema?
 I am not in any way condoning Internet piracy but some people won't wait those two months to see it at the cinema, especially with rising ticket prices and will possibly pirate the film, ultimately harming its financial success.
The cost of taking a family of say four people, two adults and two children can be four times the cost of buying the film outright on DVD on the first day of release, wait 6 months the cost of that same DVD can halve.

In an age of instant global communication, why aren't films released Worldwide simultaneously? I know there are language dubs to sort out, but that can all be done in advance and the film can go live in every cinema on virtually the same date, accounting for time zone differences that is.

This doesn't just apply to this film but all Hollywood films.",2014-11-06T20:59:19.000Z,0

2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,"Walt Disney was a 33 Degree Freemason, he and Ronal Reagan were good friends. Both men were high ranking Freemasons and both were involved heavily in the abuse of mind-controlled slaves. To prove Walt Disney was a 33 Degree Freemason just in case you have doubts going through your mind, I wish to share you some import information.

Do you know what Club 33 is?

Club 33 is a private club located in the heart of the New Orleans, USA Square section of Disneyland, officially maintained as a “secret” feature of the theme park, the entrance of the club is located next to the Blue Bayou restaurant at “33 Royal Street” with the entrance recognized by an ornate address plate with the number 33 engraved on it.

Club 33 badge:

33

Do you know what 33 stands for?

There are various origins that have been claimed for the name “Club 33”. One says the Club 33 was named for Disneyland’s 33 sponsors at the time. Another explanation is the Walt Disney chose the name simply because he liked the way “33” looked. One employee states, “33” was chosen because Walt’s lucky number was 3. These are all false; the Club 33 stands for Walt Disney was a “33rd” Degree Scottish Rite Freemason. This is a fact, provided from Wikipedia; the image below is the door to Club “33” at Disneyland.

 
Now you know Walt Disney was a 100% 33 Degree Freemason.

So what is the big deal?

Disney use illuminati mind-control through their cartoons. The amount of subliminal messaging they use is beyond your imagination. Disney have been caught out so many times through their animation, they had to censor their cartoons and re-release them on DVD because people caught them out.

Yet still from this day, no charges have been made against them. The Disney’s power, and the power behind them, has frightened most people away from challenging them. Disney has risen to become the unquestionable largest media entertainment conglomerate  in the world  & was ranked company no. 48 in the top 500 companies by Forbes 500.

Understanding Subliminal messaging…

The word subliminal literally means “below threshold”. To elaborate on this it means that you are not aware of the message it is below the threshold of your conscious perception. However you will still take the message in on some level as your subconscious mind processes it and stores this information still. Subliminal messaging therefore refers to the action of sending a suggestion directly into the subconscious mind.

So which Disney films use subliminal messages?

Almost all of them!

The practice of including hidden messages goes right back to the early mickey mouse goofy short movie animations. It started decades ago, and nearly all of their movies contain subliminal references to adult words, and even images.",2014-11-01T03:48:16.000Z,0

It was the same for Frozen and why I didn't went to see it: the trailer was just snowman jokes. Why should I want to see a movie about a dumb snowman? Turns out the movie was very good. That's because filmmakers are clever, and can make good movies, but they also have to make good trailers, and they make them to appeal to dumb people!

The only legitemately funny thing about this trailer is ""San Fransokio"". The villain also look interesting, but that's it. The rest is baloon jokes. Seriously, baloon jokes? He's a baloon so when he's tired he's deflated, he's a baloon so he uses duck tape, he's a baloon so he's squeezed into the armor... THAT'S STUPID!

Well, it might just be good. I'm not going to do the same mistake again. *does a little research* OMG! THIS IS ACTUALLY BASED ON A MARVEL COMIC! The story is not about a baloon monster or something, it's actually a team of 6 super heroes! It sounds very promising... WHERE ARE THE OTHER 5 HEROES IN THIS TRAILER??? ...trailers are stupid.

The kid should either be older looking or have  younger voice actor. I also wish they wouldn't do this bulshit wiyh the cliche groups. The intelligent but umpopular heroine,  the dude whose stupid talks like hes on weed and adds nothing to the plot, the love interest... I wont judge until I've seen.

Frozen doesnt impress me whatsoever, if its as full of plot holes and annoying singing as that then im going to pass on everything that says ""from those who brought you fucking frozen""

2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,"Guys, have you watched the news lately?

If you haven't noticed, the world's a mess. A huge mess. Beheadings, school shootings on a rampant scale, race wars, earthquakes everywhere. It's insane. And coincidentally, all of these messes we see everyday in the news were actually prophecied in advance by Jesus Christ and the Bible over 2000 years ago. Just one of many proofs that the Bible is divine (no other ""holy books"" predict the future as specifically as the Bible does. The Qur'an made a few but they're vague and some turned out to be false. The Bible has a 100% accuracy track record when it comes to prophecy and future events).

This all means that Christ is about to return. Which is great if you're saved but it'll be hell on earth if you aren't. You don't want to be here for the Tribulation period.

Though many prophecies will reach fulfillment during the Tribulation, we can see right now that all the end time signs foretold by Jesus and His prophets have emerged and are converging (all coming together at once). Here are some of these signs:

·         Israel has become a burdensome stone and is at the center of the world’s attention.
·         Unrestrained anti-Semitism is forcing more and more Jews to return to Israel.
·         Israel is literally surrounded by enemies who want to destroy the tiny nation. 
·         The nations that will participate in the upcoming wars are aligned as prophesied in the Bible.
·         Everywhere you look ethnic group is against ethnic group.
·         Wars and rumors of wars abound on earth.
·         Russia has risen, has a hook in its jaw and is allied with Iran.
·         There are many false religious movements and false prophets.
·         The kings of the east are a threat.
·         The Euphrates River can be dried to a trickle due to the Ataturk Dam, which will prepare the way for the kings of the east.
·         There is a move towards global religion, global government, and global economy.
·         Global communication, increase in knowledge
·         Ability to travel to and fro in all the earth
·         Nuclear capability
·         Signs in the sky
·         Signs in the earth; creation groaning
·         Return of diseases previously eradicated and the worrisome world Ebola threat
·         The world is like it was in the days of Noah, corrupt and filled with wickedness.
·         Horrible terrorist acts are causing fear in the hearts of people worldwide. ISIS seems bound and determined to attack on 9/11.
 
When we combine current events with the fact that ISIS controls 1/3 of Syria, and many terrorist organizations have a base in its city of Damascus, it appears evident that we will soon see the fulfillment of Isaiah 17.

(I thank Cynthia Nuara for this listing)

We're going to see all prophecy be fulfilled soon! People! WAKE UP! You can watch real-world news and see these prophecies coming to a head! The Bible isn't a bunch of fairy stories! Archaeology and  even geology and topography confirms these people, places, and events existed! And the fact that Christ's words are coming true means you're ALMOST OUT OF TIME!!!

Krishna won't help you. allah's just a moon god. And being a good person won't save you (we've all sinned in some capacity in our lives- how many people have you cussed at and trolled online this week alone?). The fact that Jesus Christ's words are coming true, prophecied in advance over 2000 years ago, proves He is the all-knowing, all-seeing, ONLY God!

And guess what? He LOVES you! He loves even though you troll people or watch hentai or suffer or did some thing you assume is unforgivable. People have burned His word yet He's forgiven them! And He wants to forgive you and help you get out of your sinful lifestyle! It doesn't matter if you're black, white, asian, or indian. You're His child! And if you'll believe in Him, accept Him as your Lord and Savior and repent of your sins, He'll save you!

TAKE THAT OFFER!!! Why settle for mud pies here on earth when Jesus offers you an eternal feast?

Don't be left behind to endure the Tribulation. Save yourselves now while the Ark doors are still open... because they're about to shut. And you DON'T want to be left here when they finally do close.

We're talking about the fate of your eternal life here... and eternity is an awful long time to choose the wrong side. Don't let satan drag you down into the lake of fire with him. That's his end game- an attitude of ""If I'm going down, you're going down with me!"" What else can explain the insane evil you see increasing everywhere? Satan knows his time is short and he wants to cause as much damage and ensnare as many souls as possible- yours included. Don't let that monster win your soul!

Now, your automatic response to reading all of this is probably firing off the typical cliched f-bombs and insisting none of this can be real. I don't blame you for thinking that way... this is scary stuff! 

If you doubt me, that's fair. You're allowed to doubt all of this if you want. I sure did for a long time. The casual passersby would chalk all this up to apocalyptic, crazy religious psychobabble! But the writing is on the wall every day in the news. 

If you doubt all this, I recommend checking out authors like Ravi Zacharias if you're sensitive to issues of race and ethnicity and how Jesus can save you. William Lane Craig and Norman L. Geisler if you're a militant atheist who believes that science is the end-all, be-all answer to everything. And Lee Strobel for those who have a curious interest into whether everything about Jesus and the Bible is true or not.

For more readily available answers, the ""One Minute Apologist"" here on youtube is great for quick answers to tough questions about God.

If you still doubt all of this, take this to heart: the Bible says Damascus (that's in Syria) will be DESTROYED. A ruinous heap. Test God's word against Him! If Damascus never falls, then the Bible is flawed! But if Damascus does soon fall... then you'll know God is no liar.

And how can an all-knowing, all-seeing, inerrant God get anything wrong? If He says Jesus is the only way to heaven, then Jesus is the only way! Save yourselves while you still can!!",2014-09-05T13:53:53.000Z,3

this is a new movie and everyone just complains/talks about frozen. wtf.
1.) if u dont like frozen dont watch it
2.) if u watched it and still dont like it start live with it
3.) if u hate the song then, now it comes, dont listen to it
i wanted to know opinions about this movie not frozen like srsly.
now a fact for everyone: frozen was good, tangled was good, so was lion king, pocahontas, hercules, bolt, etc. disney has always made good movies. i dont know 1 movie i hate. there are some i dislike so do u, dont u? but isnt it normal? i mean this is called different taste. talking about it is ok but dont spam your opinion everywhere. if u want to talk about frozen then write a comment on a frozen video. Thanks!",2014-08-30T08:35:10.000Z,1

I also don't like how people are saying ""OH THIS BETTER BE THE NEXT FROZEN"". Stop hating on Frozen, please. One day it will become a Disney classic like Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, etc. I'm sure there will be plenty of Disney movies coming out soon which will be the new ""overhyped FROZEN"". ",2014-08-22T23:11:04.000Z,3

2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,"I don't like because they have destroyed a promising story with great developed characters.
Hiro and Baymax was logical that alter shaped to look like Disney characters, being cute with an dark past, ""at least he still have a mother.""
The original villian its scary and cool, I admit that.
Go Go Tomago seems to be faithful to the comic, a badass criminal but good-hearted.
These four are fine, BUT THEN ARE THE OTHERS THERE ARE A F***** SHIT.
Honey Lemon looks like a hippie-like girl unable to show a bit of courage, being extroverted and flirtatious in the comic. Maybe her original desing weren't suited to Disney standards, but this version is ridiculous.
Fred, in the comic, is an ordinary boy with an air of though guy, cursed with the spirit of a huge and amazing Kaiju, a japan monster, wich can get their strengh through astral materialization, the most terrefing against their enemies. In fact, he doesn't want to be a super-hero, not even like him, just want to be a normal boy.
In the movie, its a stupid and a nerd of monsters and super-heroes. The worst is that it hasn't a spirit, not even transforms into a monster as might seems, no, he uses a crappy monster costume apparently removed from the list of rejected characters from Monster Inc, being too tacky even fo them.
AND THEN IS WASABI-NO-GINGER, DEAR GOD.
THE ONLY OF THEM THAT LOOKS THE MOST JAPANESE, SUSHI MASTER, EXPERT SWORDSMAN, WITH THE POWER TO MANIPULATE CHI TO USE AS A NOT DEADLY WEAPON, MAKE IT INTO A BLACK MEN WITH A SUIT WITH PLASMA CUTTERS.
WELL DONE DISNEY, THIS IS HOW YOU GET SOME ETHNIC EQUALITY IN A MOVIE, REPLACING ALL THE CHARACTERS WITH A JAPANESE LOOK AND USING THE STANDARD PACKAGE WITH THE  LOVING AND GOOD GIRL, THE REBEL GIRL, THE STUPID BOY OF THE MOVIE AND THE BLACK GUY.
VERY JAPANESE.
Dont get me wrong, surely the story and the animation will be alright, but the design and development of the characters is the worst I've seen. If you don't believe me, read the original comics and you will see that they have wasted the opportunity to make a decent movie within the standards of Marvel.
I hope this does not affect in other semi-famous super-heroes of Marvel like Moon Knight, Nova or Black Panther.",2014-08-21T16:50:31.000Z,0

Frozen has awesome trailers, and is an awesome movie all by itself. It's my all-time favorite movie!!! I can't wait for Frozen 2!!! C'mon, Disney, let Big Hero 6 go and go make Frozen 2 first! We have lots of time to make other movies, but Frozen 2 can't wait! If you make Big Hero 6 first, then Frozen 2 will come out in 2016!!!! But if you make Frozen 2 first, then it will come much sooner! Then everyone will be happy! Why work on another movie when you've got thousands of Frozen fans waiting for Frozen 2? I know, I know, movies take time to make. But if you start now, the sooner you'll get it done! Your fans will thank you! I probably can't convince Disney to drop everything they were working on and make Frozen 2, but maybe we can make Frozen 2 come or come sooner! Go make Frozen 2 sooner, 
Disney, before you forget and make another movie! I'm not forcing you, I just want Frozen 2 to come...please? You know what they all say, don't judge a book by its cover, so oil watch Big Hero 6 when it comes out, who knows? I might like it. But Frozen will still be my all-time favorite.

I'm reading comments.  WTF is wrong with people?  The cast is racially diverse, and people are STILL bitching.  ""I can't believe Wasabi isn't Japanese"".  Sorry, is a black kid having a Japanese name culture appropriation or something?  And is it suddenly illegal for someone to have interests outside their own culture?  And who cares if Honey Lemon isn't Japanese?  The IMPORTANT thing is she's breaking the stereotype about what kind of girls can be interested in science, and (hopefully) millions of little girls around the world will see that.

This is only ""loosely"" based.  Obviously it's not going to be an exact copy.  I think it's lovely that they're taking the opportunity to break so many traditional character molds.",2014-07-27T13:43:11.000Z,4

2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,"I'm not sure why everybody is so mad about it being different from the source material. Most Marvel fans, even the hardcore ones (like myself) had almost never heard of BH6 before the movie. I didn't even know they were a thing before I read Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth. My point is, the comics for these characters are very, very obscure, so I don't know a lot of people that have ever actually READ the very few comics that these characters have. Nonetheless I'm excited for the movie. Not too mad about Baymax. Just a little off putting that he's a...robot balloon. Just a little. Other than that, I'm cool with the designs, even Fredzilla, who is probably the most terrifying thing I've ever seen in my life. I only have 2 things to say from here forward.

1. Is anybody else excited that C-Level/D-Level heroes even got this far? I am, but I'm also worried. Even though they're getting a movie, I'm also worried that they'll never be taken seriously BEYOND the movie, especially since this is not connected to the MCU in any way.

2. Considering Sunfire isn't in the movie, I'm kind of disappointed since he was originally the leader. But hey, it's not a big deal. I would like to see an Easter egg in the beginning where Sunfire is a hero when Hiro (Hero, Hiro, HEERO, gah) was a kid. Sunfire tells Hiro ""Anybody can be a Hero"". Anyway, that's all I wanted to say.",2014-07-22T01:44:52.000Z,0

The more you express your ""not liking"" of it, the more it's still in social media, do you not understand? How do you think Miley Cyrus does it. The more you express your ""hate with a passion"" for her, the more she's in social media, the more she's talked about, and the more money she makes due to her outrageous and provacative (can't spell) videos. So my theory is: if you stop talking about something/someone, the less they will known/talked about, the *poof*, they're gone. I know some of you hate frozen, but the longer you talk about it (weather it's good or bad), the more ""hype"" it receives! This goes for any person or topic! Now this movie looks promising, can that be the topic here: BIG HERO 6, not STILL BETTER THAN FROZEN.

But now I am sure it will be a good movie! Besides, if we can think about it simply as a Disney movie, it could be really enjoyble.

Baymax seems a great character.

But what made me feel so happy was Fred!
He's voiced by T.J. Miller ... the same voice of Tuffnut from Httyd!!! I LOVE Httyd, as all the people who worked to it, they're all awesome!!!

Besides, what Fred says in the car it's IDENTICAL to what Tuff could say1!! So AWESOME!!

I think this could be an interesting movie, maybe not so bad!!

Try to not judge it soon!

I mean, what the flip?! Wreck-it Ralph was amazing and before Frozen it had lots of recognition. But when Frozen came out, all the Wreck-it stuff just disappeared and we never saw it again.

Also,  just FYI (To all you Frozen fangirls) I'm not against songs in movies.  In fact,  I think songs are what give the Disney ""Classics"" their charm.  The Frozen songs were just a bit too...  ""Pop-ish""  for my taste.  Not to mention,  they seemed a bit excessive.",2014-07-18T07:59:10.000Z,0

2014-07-15T14:50:19.000Z,z3biFxZIJOQ,Disney&#39;s Big Hero 6 - Official US Trailer 1,"I’m excited for this movie, but I can’t say I’m a big fan of the changes in design. The super serious but awesome Baymax is now silly and childlike (I don’t mind this one too much), Wasabi is now African American (seriously, his name is Wasabi. Is it so hard to keep him Japanese?), and Fredzilla is just wtf did they do to him?

I like Honey Lemon and Gogo’s designs though.

I wonder if they will (or can even) mention the fact that Hiro’s role models are Tony Stark and Reed Richards… 

From my standpoint, this is *very* loosely based off the Big Hero 6 comics... To the point where I don't even get why they used the Big Hero 6 name. 

Nonetheless, if you look at this movie with an open mind away from the comics, it looks amazing so far. :)",2014-07-18T01:29:43.000Z,73

Mostly because of Steven T Seagle, Duncan Rouleau and <shutter..> Joe Quesada's influence in the writing and design department.
 Producing bad Marvel TV spinoffs that force comic icons like spiderman and the Avengers into being more PC, Following some virtual meme like live streaming, Mismatching character and plot devices from the comics onto the show that make less sense and are shoehorned ads for ether the movies or the comics from 3-5 years ago, and just not putting in any real-life contrast in the human factor of the heroes' identity.
 Add the heavy Disney lobbyist backed advertising portfolio and the retcons of Spiderman: One more day, and you get a big brightly colored billboard with Quesada's swollen head saying ""I ruined the Marvel fan-base, But Disney says that's Okay!.""
 Oh! that Marvel crossover with Phineas and Ferb was the worst TV special  ever in all existence and everyone involved should shoot themselves in the foot. ",2014-07-16T06:07:43.000Z,0

Next is going to be an anthropomorphic film (animals acting like humans, kind of like Robin Hood) in 2016, Giants in 2016 (Jack and the Beanstalk with the director of Tangled), and Moana an original polynesian epic/tale that comes maybe 2017 or 2018 (the directors of The Little Mermaid, and Aladdin and the composer of the broadway musical of The Lion King. This movie sounds epic to me already). And some untitled tenage space race film directed by Jennifer Lee and Dean Wellins comes out probably 2018 or 2019.
