I'd also like to think I have good taste; the fact that the Nostalgia Critic likes a lot of the movies that I do says a lot.

So I'll say it: I don't think Cars 2 is bad, not by any measure. It may not be the best Pixar film, but by no stretch is it a bad film, not at all. If you're still wary about it, check it out. It's not a bad film at all.",2012-07-19T05:47:46.000Z,3
