Also, why is a character that is always a villain in every other version of the X-men but this one giving a rousing heroic speech?  I wish they would do Mystique right and stop trying to make her a hero in these movies.",2016-04-25T23:44:44.000Z,0

One thing I gotta say about Fox's X-Men movies is that they have the best tone out of the current crop of Comic Book movies. They have the jokes and the darkness whereas Marvel leans too much towards the jokes and DC too much towards the darkness.
