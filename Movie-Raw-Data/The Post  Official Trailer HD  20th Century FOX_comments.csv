When someone looks at such documents they have to be viewed  in the light of the philosophy of the time and from a wider perspective not only the national scene but beyond as well.  Also no one is forced to join the army. If you don't want to go to war don't join the army.

2017-11-08T05:31:00.000Z,nrXlY6gzTTM,The Post | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"Having recently watched the brilliant Ken Burns documentary The Vietnam War I was really interested in seeing Steven Spielberg's take on just a small part of the story of that needless war . You don't get two bigger stars than Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep so you are pretty much guaranteed good performances but my worry was , was it going to be too schmaltzy? Thankfully the answer is no.

This the story of Katharine Graham , the first female publisher of The Washington Post. With help from editor Ben Bradlee, they races to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover up of government secrets that spans three decades and four U.S. presidents. Together, they try to overcome their differences as they risk their careers and freedom to help bring long-buried truths to light.

While I have to say I like The Post it did have the feel of a made for TV movie which is odd for a Spielberg film. It's very simply told and is easy to follow which is good for a political film but perhaps too simple at times. 
Tom Hanks is great while Meryl Streep seems to have slipped into her Iron Lady costume again.
I love the way the actual telephone conversations with Nixon are used throughout the film because that really does give it context.
Nominated for best picture , I doubt very much this will but knowing how The Academy fawn over Streep and that everything in Hollywood is about ""The Woman"" at the moment i wouldn't surprise me if she wins Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role.  7 out of 10",2018-02-02T16:36:16.000Z,0

He gently injects all the goodness of a heartwarming thriller and mixes it with a packet of societal mores and gender discrimination, never preaching, and yet subtly laying it as it is; and all the time, the movie develops with the urgency of a just-in-time delivery, also satisfactorily lubricating the eye-glands that are set into motion when good-hearted folks watch well-meaning brethren slide toward triumph, all the stumbling blocks making a timely cinematic appearance to make the climax a breathless countdown to the final roll of the printing press.""

It didn't just vilify Nixon but beginning with the Truman administration and continued with Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson. So both Democrat and Republican Presidents have lied to the American People in regards to the United States involvement in Vietnam. And don't give me this ""Washington Post is fake news"" because shut up. The press isn't always 100% correct and besides the press is meant to serve the governed not the government. So I strongly recommend you see this film and you'll be amazed at the parallels to our current administration and the Nixon administration in terms of how he vilified the free press and learn how important the freedom of the press is for America.",2018-01-14T04:25:44.000Z,359

If you've read either book, Graham and Bradlee will be very familiar to you. To have them played by two of the world's greatest actors is an achievement in itself. While I'm sure that for many people, this movie will be their first acquaintanceship with Nixon and the Washington Post, it should not be their last. Read the books too.

 In July 1965 Katharine Graham appointed Ben Bradlee as managing editor of the Washington Post. Graham was pleased with the way Bradlee edited the Post and in 1968 she appointed him vice president of the company. Bradlee and Graham were strong supporters of the Vietnam War. This was partly because of the support the newspaper gave to President Lyndon B. Johnson. Daniel Ellsberg was a member of the McNamara Study Group that in 1968 had produced the classified History of Decision Making in Vietnam, 1945-1968. Ellsberg, disillusioned with the progress of the war, believed this document should be made available to the public. He gave a copy of what later became known as the Pentagon Papers to William Fulbright. However, he refused to do anything with the document, so Ellsberg gave a copy to Phil Geyelin of the Washington Post. Bradlee and Katharine Graham decided against publishing the contents of the document. Ellsberg now went to the New York Times and they began publishing extracts from the document on 13th June, 1971.
The Washington Post was one of the last major papers to turn against the Vietnam War. Even today, it hews to a hard foreign policy line--usually to the right of The New York Times, a paper not known for having transcended the Cold War.
There was Watergate, of course, that model of aggressive reporting by the Post. But even here, Graham's Post was doing the establishment's work.

I had orders to Vietnam in Aug 63, & JFK saved my life by stopping the Vietnam war.

JFK made a deal with the Russians to ask Cuba to give back the SAM's, 
they were using to shoot  down US U-2's,  
if the US will take its dozen ICBM's out of Turkey, surrounding the Soviet Union.

Watergate was a cover up of the JFK assassination.  

Both GHW Bush & Nixon were in Dallas 11-22-63, along with Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis 
& Manual Artime, all part of the Bay of Pigs.  

The US media worked hard to avoid connecting the dots, from Cuba to Vietnam, to Dallas to Watergate.

Yes, you & 4 friends can actually stop global warming.  

Here is the first step: lobby your school board to put 500 solar panel on your local school.

Then lobby your PUC to requires Utilities to pay $0.49 kwh for surplus solar sold onto the grid.  

If all new construction , in the burned areas of Napa, LA, Sonoma, Lake, etc. were required to be 100% solar homes, 

 like Lancaster, Ca requires, the homes would be safer from the next fire.

A roof, covered with glass solar panels,  

is less likely to catch on fire from flying embers.  

All new construction in California  should be 100% solar powered. 

Mass Movement. 

Germany shut all Nukes by building 4-plex homes w 

100 solar panels. We  can shut all Nukes 

if U build 4-plex solar home

We can rebuilt California into a solar economy , using decentralization, 

by each building 4-plex solar homes, with 100 panels.

The trailer/movie states this was going on for 30 years & that includes Democrats.  The Pentagon Papers was a report from 1945-1967.  That includes 3 Democrat administrations, Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson.  From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers:

 ""Leak:
Daniel Ellsberg knew the leaders of the task force well. He had worked as an aide to McNaughton from 1964 to 1965, had worked on the study for several months in 1967, and Gelb and Halperin approved his access to the work at RAND in 1969.[9] Now opposing the war, Ellsberg and his friend Anthony Russo[19] photocopied the study in October 1969 intending to disclose it. Ellsberg approached Nixon's National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, Senators William Fulbright and George McGovern, and others, but none were interested.[9]

In February 1971, Ellsberg discussed the study with The New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan, and gave 43 of the volumes to him in March. Before publication, The New York Times sought legal advice. The paper's regular outside counsel, Lord Day & Lord, advised against publication,[9] but house counsel James Goodale prevailed with his argument that the press had a First Amendment right to publish information significant to the people's understanding of their government's policy.

The New York Times began publishing excerpts on June 13, 1971; the first article in the series was titled ""Vietnam Archive: Pentagon Study Traces Three Decades of Growing US Involvement"". The study was dubbed The Pentagon Papers during the resulting media publicity.[9][20] Street protests, political controversy, and lawsuits followed.

To ensure the possibility of public debate about the papers' content, on June 29, US Senator Mike Gravel entered 4,100 pages of the papers to the record of his Subcommittee on Public Buildings and Grounds. These portions of the papers, which were edited for Gravel by Howard Zinn and Noam Chomsky, were subsequently published by Beacon Press, the publishing arm of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations.[21] A federal grand jury was subsequently empaneled to investigate possible violations of federal law in the release of the report. Leonard Rodberg, a Gravel aide, was subpoenaed to testify about his role in obtaining and arranging for publication of the Pentagon Papers. Gravel asked the court (in Gravel v. United States) to quash the subpoena on the basis of the Speech or Debate Clause in Article I, Section 6 of the United States Constitution.

That clause provides that ""for any Speech or Debate in either House, [a Senator or Representative] shall not be questioned in any other Place"", meaning that Gravel could not be prosecuted for anything said on the Senate floor, and, by extension, for anything entered to the Congressional Record, allowing the papers to be publicly read without threat of a treason trial and conviction. When Gravel's request was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the Court denied the request to extend this protection to Gravel or his legislative aide, Leonard Rodberg, because the grand jury subpoena served on them related to a third party rather than any act they themselves committed for the preparation of materials later entered into the Congressional Record. Nevertheless, the grand jury investigation was halted, and the publication of the papers was never prosecuted.

Later, Ellsberg said the documents ""demonstrated unconstitutional behavior by a succession of presidents, the violation of their oath and the violation of the oath of every one of their subordinates.""[22] He added that he leaked the Papers to end what he perceived to be ""a wrongful war.""[22]

The Nixon administration's restraint of the media

President Nixon's first reaction to the publication was that, since the study embarrassed the Johnson and Kennedy administrations rather than his, he should do nothing. However, Henry Kissinger convinced the president that not opposing the publication set a negative precedent for future secrets.[9] The administration argued Ellsberg and Russo were guilty of a felony under the Espionage Act of 1917, because they had no authority to publish classified documents.[23] After failing to persuade the Times to voluntarily cease publication on June 14,[9] Attorney General John N. Mitchell and Nixon obtained a federal court injunction forcing the Times to cease publication after three articles.[9] Times publisher Arthur Ochs Sulzberger said:

    Newspapers, as our editorial said this morning, we're really a part of history that should have been made available, considerably longer ago. I just didn't feel there was any breach of national security, in the sense that we were giving secrets to the enemy.[24]

The newspaper appealed the injunction, and the case New York Times Co. v. United States (403 U.S. 713) quickly rose through the U.S. legal system to the Supreme Court.[25]

On June 18, 1971, The Washington Post began publishing its own series of articles based upon the Pentagon Papers;[9] Ellsberg had given portions to the Post reporter Ben Bagdikian. Bagdikian brought the information to editor Ben Bradlee. That day, Assistant U.S. Attorney General William Rehnquist asked the Post to cease publication. After the paper refused, Rehnquist sought an injunction in U.S. district court. Judge Murray Gurfein declined to issue such an injunction, writing that ""[t]he security of the Nation is not at the ramparts alone. Security also lies in the value of our free institutions. A cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press must be suffered by those in authority in order to preserve the even greater values of freedom of expression and the right of the people to know.""[26] The government appealed that decision, and on June 26 the Supreme Court agreed to hear it jointly with the New York Times case.[25] Fifteen other newspapers received copies of the study and began publishing it.[9]""  From Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers",2017-11-09T16:46:50.000Z,0

Help my Family and Me!

I need the attached information (unequivocal truth) uploaded for everyone to see. I have tried unsuccessfully.

Good afternoon, my name is Benjamin Allen Sullivan. I have world and humanity changing discoveries (Mathematics, Physics, and Otherwise) that have been prevented from recognition and academic accreditation by the intelligence community. Below is the information that I have sent to thousands of Media, Government, my Fellow Americans, Academia, and every legitimate faucet of Democracy relentlessly without success (manipulation by the CIA et al.).
I have attached my discoveries (Unification) and the patents that I own (including filing certificates) for the Quantum Technological Revolution (Quantum Radio and Communications, Quantum Imager, and Quantum Encryption Systems and Software) are available at the links provided below.

My family and I need your help ‚Äì our lives depend on it!

We need you to validate and publish my Discoveries, Physics, and Science. 

Any other help that you can provide will contribute to saving our lives:
1. I need a Whistle-Blower Attorney (and firm) for the no fail contingency case of a lifetime (I am willing to pay a premium). 
2. Main Stream Media Reporting the Truth.
3. Medical Attention for the removal of these implants and the remainder of me repaired after years of torture, abuse, and multiple attempts at my life.
4. Academia (you) validating my Discoveries, Physics, and Science and reporting the same.
Please help us!

Help my family and Me!
_____________________________________________________________________________________

Good afternoon, my name is Benjamin Allen Sullivan and I desperately need your help and legal counsel. 

I have information substantiating years of torture, abuse, multiple attempts at my life, a botched CIA operation in Russia, theft of my intellectual property, and decimation of my life by the CIA and CSIS.

I had a deadline of 13 July 2017 to have these filed with WIPO and have them fully protected. There is no way that I could have accomplished this after these people have systematically destroyed my life.

These people have manipulated my life in every way and prevented the sale and filing of my intellectual property and prevented the establishment of my business to exploit my discoveries, physics, and science. 

In fact, there is absolutely no statute for time (or even my actions - which have been honorable and truthful) as long as these illegal implants remain in my body and my U.S. Constitutional Rights and Civil Liberties are being discarded with every legitimate facet of democracy prevented from functioning. 

This intellectual property is worth trillions of dollars and it has been stolen (I possess the patents for a quantum radio, quantum communications system, quantum imager, quantum encryption and associated software ‚Äì filing certificates attached and other intellectual property prevented from filing). I can pay you/your firm with the recovery and filing of this intellectual property which is an integral component of this case. This is the contingency case of a lifetime and I am willing to pay a premium for your firm‚Äôs legal help.

I will engage the Affirmative Asylum process (I have an I-589 electronically filled out - attached). 

I am a U.S. Citizen and entitled to ALL my Constitutional Rights and Civil Liberties. My U.S. Government (CIA) Drugged me by stabbing with a needle and put these illegal implants in my body. 

I need your help with this urgently.

In addition to this, I have presented all the same information that I have given you to the Washington Post (Peter Finn) and thousands of other media emails.

I am living by squatting in houses, in a tent, or in shelters after arriving in DC on 02 July 2017. I entered the US from Mexico by swimming across the Rio Grande and hitchhiking my way here. I do not have a fixed-address. I am prepared (and looking forward to) being a witness against these criminals and bringing them all to justice via legitimate democratic trials on home US soil with public access, media, public accountability, and all the components of democracy functioning.

I need your counsel more than you can imagine. I require a lawyer that is willing to tackle the former director of the CIA, the U.S., and Canadian Governments, CSIS, and the remainder of the implicated intelligence communities involved.

I am in constant fear of my life and need your help and your legal counsel!

I know how incredible all of this sounds (and it is incredible), I could not make this up if I wanted to and I have the substantiating evidence to support it. Please start with reading the document: CSIS Murdering Ring and Operation in Russia

Please help me immediately.

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6ch0mgORF2MVEs2NXBmaDlNRzg?usp=sharing 

I have also temporarily abolished a former business website to place all of the documentation in one place: 
www.reculuxury.com 

Please Help Me!

*note* that my phone no longer works and I can only be contacted via e-mail: CEO@BASRC.Biz I can phone you prior if we arrange it, and I am able to meet with you in person (preferred) once you have had a chance to review all the information.

He‚Äôs not making ‚Äúbad‚Äù movies now by any means, they‚Äôre just missing that sense of wonder, they‚Äôre missing that amazing suspense he could create. 

Does anyone really think this film will be remembered after a few years? I know in a way I‚Äôm not being fair because I haven‚Äôt seen it, but it just feels like the typical Oscar season ‚Äúserious political thriller/procedural‚Äù that‚Äôs only made to win awards.
