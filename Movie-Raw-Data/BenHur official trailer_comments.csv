How did they remake this as only spectacle and somehow have less spectacle than the original movie. Hollywood has the same problem that politics has. They let these crap directors make remake beloved franchises instead of getting someone competent, and they think it‚Äôs a success if they make money. They don‚Äôt think of all the money they could have made if the director and movie was actually good.

2016-03-16T16:11:10.000Z,3BmeR9GYdDU,"Ben-Hur Official Trailer #1 (2016) - Morgan Freeman, Jack Huston Movie HD","Although I agree with the comments on Hollywood & it's lazy cash cowing of remakes & choosing "" Ben Hur "" to me was a bad idea as it has been made (including this one) 4 times now that it's been remade....

But 2 early B&W versions were not talkies & the movie industry was in it's infancy & believe it or not the movie industry in it's very early genises used B&W Boxing Fights to make its money atbthe start, as Boxing was & still is a huge draw for people, as the pugilistic arts still is apart from when UFC took off, the only thing closed to legal blood sport & what kept the Romans happy with Chariot Races & Gladiatorial Battles made great sense to those who knew how to make money & exploit those doing this within the movie industry, as who doesn't love a good sword & sandles movie...

This genre is not one that has been done to death like the western films but when they did do them they were usually huge movies with big stars & even bigger budgets & after the disastrous attempt at making "" Cleopatra "" with Richard Burton & Elizabeth Taylor the studios decided no more as that movie nearly shut bankrupt Hollywood ti the point of closing it down for good & this was because of the timeframe the movie took to finally finish & the many financial disasters that hit that movie while making it & even the affair that started during the making of this movie with Burton & Taylor wasn't enough to save this movie & this genre was dropped until it eventually found a new audience after a much needed rest from this type of extravagant film..

Yes there's been some movies made about this timeframe & genre but it took Ridley Scott's "" Gladiator "" to make Hollywood & Fans to fall in love with this genre again...

All I know is I've just watched this version & found it to be a very good & entertaining movie that also added more content within the movie as far as the story's narrative was concerned,  but wasn't a butt numbing 3 hours plus movie....

I enjoyed this movie & if you give it a chance you may find, like myself, that although it's another remake it actually adds more overall depth than the Old Charlton Heston movie that's put on Tv every Easter...

And that is my overall point here with regards to the many negative comments & that is
 "" Have you even watched this version of Ben Hur! ""

I have never had much love or pander to someone who chooses a career as a critic & have never listened to their opinions whether it was films/books/music et al & I made up my own mind as to whether I liked something not critics...

I myself had tired of the very idea of a 4th version of "" Ben Hur "" as I grew up seeing the old B&W versions & obviously the biggest one that was a box office hit with Charlton Heston &  believe when I say I've seen that movie to the point that I'd never watch it again, & this is coming from a huge movie fan & aficionado of these movie's & it took only recently for me to actually go out of my way to watch this movie..

As I always do with any movie I leave the hype or negativity at the door & this is the best & truest version of Lee Wallace's "" Ben Hur - A Tale Of Christ ""

Although the main actors are well known in the movie industry, they delibaretly for budget reasons I'm guessing, went with actors that wouldn't come with a huge price tag but would still deliver a great performance...

Now I'll admit there are no award winning performances here, but that doesn't mean they didn't do a great job & if you watch this version you'll see a more realistic & potent version of Ben Hur...

Yes there are some content related to the Charlton Heston version but alot of this movie is fresher & has a slightly different take on this epic that was a best selling book which went on to become a book that the studios couldn't wait to make movies about as it has everything within it for a great movie/allegiance/love & hate/betrayal/religion/redemption/forgiveness/revenge & many more & though this movie isn't as long as the Charlton Heston version it crams in more content at half the time of that version...

I have to admit I was completely taken aback at how much they re-envisioned this & how much I enjoyed it, but as always I leave it up to others to make up their mind & not be swayed one way or the other but go in under neutrality...

It's in your hands!... "" To Be Or Not To Be ""

 You should not compare it to 1959 classic

 you should compare it to NOAA and the Ten Commandments movie with Christian Bale,

Milk face all over the place, no classic beauty like we have seen in William Wylers masterpiece. This strip is about some boys, 1959 is about real men that actually evolve during the 222 minutes. I don't see what the spectator could learn from this gathering - the audience is left confused and without empowerment. The story jumps without any sense of transition. There is a focus on portraying war in a certain way. I don't think The battles happen in the dark - the commanders are maniacs. I did like the special effects. However they were a little bit over the top. I don't know why modern movies would be dumped down - I mean people are becoming more intelligent throughout the decades.

What did they expect, with such law quality dialogues,  with such huge parts of the true story missing (being adopted by Quintus Arrius is a crucial element in the storytelling) and with such miserable interpretation of the characters... I will not argue on Charlton Heston's play of the leading role (which was beyond perfection!). But, for goodness sake, just take a look on Messala's character!

3- The Roman and the Israelis must  become friend in the end..!! Have they ever be...!? Then who would betrayed Jesus & crucified him..!!?

1. Contro ogni credibilit√† storica, i Romani sono brutti e cattivi, cattivoni propio. Pi√π simili ad una dittatura nazista che mai, i romani sono degli schiavisti spietati ed occupatori violenti di terre (dei predecessori degli americani insomma). Questi aspetti ve li sottolineano fino alla nausea per tutto il film... Ve l'ho gi√† detto che i romani sono degli infami?

2. Solo i cristiani sono puri, buoni e impeccabili (almeno fino al medioevo, ma il regista del film sembra dimenticarsene)

3. Ges√π √® una sorta di fusione ante litteram tra Obi-wan Kenobi e Gandalf che crea piogge miracolose e fa comparse misteriose riuscendo col solo sguardo ad ammutolire anche il centurione pi√π ignorante

3. Gli effetti speciali sono cos√¨ brutti che, si dice, che questo film sia stato d'ispirazione a SHARKNADO

4. Alla fine del film, il tutto si chiude con una canzone pop di una cantante americana in stile Lady Gaga, una colonna sonora in pieno stile imperiale romano insomma

5. Morgan Freeman non fa un cazzo di concreto, come sempre. Oddio, forse fa qualcosa pi√π del solito ma rimane sempre abbastanza inutile.

6. Anche se il film √® une merda (fatta eccezione per la scena della gara di bighe che, in fondo, non √® male), il lord comandante Mormont rimane comunque uno cazzutissimo... No aspetta, forse mi sto confondendo

7. Alla fine, dopo due ore di odii e rancori, dopo che uno dei protagonisti ha tradito la propria famiglia e il proprio fratello, condannando a morte l'una e alla schiavit√π l'altro; dopo vari spargimenti di sangue e la perdita di una gamba, i due fratelli fanno la pace come se niente fosse e tornano ad amarsi perch√© l'ha detto Ges√π, che forse era Obi-Wan kenobi... O forse Gandalf?",2016-10-01T06:29:35.000Z,0

Don't get me wrong , this is not close to the 1959 version , but it is still a good time with pretty good acting especially by jack Huston who gives a magnificent performance. The action is great and the scenery is descent. Also , this movie has a great soundtrack. Nothing like the two trailers.The only problem is the story sometimes , the editing and the pacing. Also i did not like how mesala's character was written although Toby Kebbell gives a stellar performance as always. I would recommend this movie to people who have watched the original because it makes some honorable changes to the classic story in order to keep things fresh. This is Ben-hur for another generation , Not as good as the old one , but a really good movie by today standards.",2016-09-12T20:19:09.000Z,2

The original won ELEVEN Oscars, including two acting oscars. Charlton Heston was perfect as the main character, Stephen Boyd made of Messala one of the greatest villans ever, Hugh Griffith won a well deserved oscar playing Sheik Ilderim, Jack Hawkins was great, on another important role in a classic movie, and the master Finlay Currie touched us all playing Balthazar, one of the three Magi.

Scenes like the Chariot race and the one where Jesus giving water to Ben-Hur were cinematic miracles. And of course, the soundtrack, composed by the myth, the legend, the genius MIKLOS ROZSA, is one of the most beautiful things i've ever heard.

Anyway, the remaking of this movie was a sin.",2016-08-26T23:03:50.000Z,0

It is not easy to accept a mostly unknown actor to replace the great Charlton Heston and his powerful acting personality...even if Jack Huston is a good new actor and comes from a great Cinema Dynasty Family; ¬†but we'll see...



Nevertheless...if they do not respect the original script as ""biblical story"" and consider that Ben-Hur is the story of Jesus Christ believers and they turn it (as they have done with the poor movie EXODUS) in an ""action movie"", leaving out the ""main religious message"" of the original script, it is going to be so sad and it will remain as a simple commercial success...


¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† It is not a shame to believe in God. Now, more than ever before, to give Testimony of The Begotten Son of God, becomes the most important and greatest goal in our Lives.


In the 2016 movie RISEN, they put a maori from New Zeland as Jesus, but they use the Turin Sindone, in what it appears very clear, the real Face of The Lord, totally and 100% different to Cliff Curtis. RIDICULOUS AT ALL !




Also this Jesus, is the WORST of all the actors that have represented Jesus, in¬†the most poor, awful, cold, nonsense, heartless, vulgar, un-expressive, ¬†senseless funny attitude as was never before showed the transcendental Message of God, as¬†the most cold of all human beings...a petty...they have made a common ordinary disaster, of a script that¬†could be a refreshing beautiful spiritual story...a shame...



NOAH with Russel Crow, no comments...incongruent 100% with the Bible and Sumerian story and absolutely ridiculous, at least for those who know the real Noah (Utnapishtim for the Sumerian original story) 
A poor UNBEARABLE GARBAGE-TRASH ""ANTI-SCRIPT""
If you take a Biblical story, perhaps the Mohammed, Krishna Zoroaster or Buddha story, you MUST do it as it is, not as you stupidly invent or want to DISTORT, and make¬†confuse those who have never read The Bible, The Coran, The Bhagavad-Gƒ´tƒÅ or the buddhist Sutras, from we¬†only know about their magnificent and respectful Lives. 

It¬†has non sense at all. ABSURD. Even for a non believer (I respect that you may not believe in A Superior Being), it becomes miserable to watch a story that everyone knows as totally different and now shown by these¬†disrespectful ""rewriters of the ancient History"", in an infamous needlessly INCOHERENT self-version.








Otherwise, just take the million stories that even great writers wrote





I hope that also Mel Gibson, give us a new beautiful Legacy, based on the Truth and realistic, by making ""The Resurrection of Christ"", as it really happened...

Christ's depiction in the 1959 film is one of the most incredible revelations of character I've ever seen in cinema -- both enchanting and mysterious at the same time. There's a certain mystique in not displaying his face, not to mention respect to the figure himself, and we can already see that this remake missed that chance.

But no, instead  more silly and inaccurate fight scenes, more over the top cgi, Why not go back to the old school days like Spartacus and Ben Hur or even Gladiator, At least try to honour those great films of the past who relied on great acting and great directing with limited technology and they still manage to stand tall.

Hollywood is full of sh*t and has been for many years but more so now than ever,completely out of touch with reality and the real world.
This will bring out the ""race baiters"" but I will say it anyway- It seems they have to stick a token black actor in every movie and then we have Marvel with a black Nick Fury. Marvel comics have always been about having a back story on it's characters and a black Nick Fury is wrong. Now they are going to make a black 007 which is absurd.
Ian Fleming has written dozens of 007 books and James Bond has a very distinct back story and it had nothing to do with a black man.

The scenes that it even represents that has a great impact seem to even fall short. The TV version remake of Ben-Hur was closer to the original than this trailer from what is seen as it represents. Seriously, I would of thought that if a remake was to happen, would be even greater than the original but I continue to be let down even with all the action and great scenes if you can't keep the plot and characters in line that matter, the rest of the film doesn't matter because right there you already know you have a failure.",2016-03-21T11:21:56.000Z,0

That is what they care about. 
Secondly - Trailers can be incredibly misleading in terms of a movies tone. Just look how different the two Suicide Squad trailers are for an example of that.
Thirdly - Remakes allow a story to be introduced to a new generation. Whether the film is good or not ultimately doesn't matter as it brings the  existence of previous versions (i.e. Ben Hur 1959) to the attention of younger viewers. 
Ultimately I'd rather see a remake of Ben Hur to see what modern cinema can do with it than have them remake something from the 90s that's totally unnecessary. 
Plus this remake will have absolutely no affect on the 1959 Epic apart from bring it's attention to a younger audience. If you don't like the idea of this remake don't watch it and instead rewatch the classic.

He sees how his horses respond to Judah, & let's him train them, & run them against Messala in the greatest action sequence EVER FILMED, the chariot race. Heston learned how to do it, as did Stephen Boyd, & it makes that sequence even more exciting. Only in one quick scene, did Heston have a double : the 2nd unit Director's son.

on the non-religious side of things they took an epic movie and dumbed it down into a 2ish hour movie that is all fast and furious, and lacking all substance.  A dumber version of Gladiator not to mention the terrible CGI!!!

Horses in the chariot racing seem to be real for the most part, even in spots where you'd expect digital animals they look really good. Sweat and muscle tone visible. Looks like they've gone for a lot of practical effects, which is nice. On-site location shooting, another plus (take note, Gods of Egypt). 

Film doesn't release until August so I'm excited to see what else they have to show us, but as of right now the film looks really good. 11 Academy Awards good? Probably not. The director gives me some pause though. His only two big budget direction (been a producer for several) projects are ""Wanted"" and ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter."" Eh.....

Anyway, excited to see what is to come of this.",2016-03-17T13:56:37.000Z,0

At the very least the chariot scene needs to be practical, because if a 1957 movie looks better than your 2016 version then you did something wrong.

This isn't going to hold up, which brings up the question why not just re-release the 1957 version, in 3D I don't care, that would allow young people to see it, the right way, as well as bring in the ticket sales you so desperately seem to need. Seeing an epic like Ben-Hur on the big screen is a bloody privilege. 

Why? The big question for this movies existence. If you are remaking a movie that is perfect or near-so, then you either need to do something completely different, a new interpretation if you will, like Magnificent Seven, or as previously mentioned re-release the original. But to have the nerve to do whatever hell this interpretation of Ben-Hur is, would be  on the same level as straight up remaking 12 Angry Men, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly or Lawrence of Arabia.

Have you actually seen the original? While it is a classic film, it was made in 1959. So unless you are over the age of 57. you weren't even born when this film was made. Film buffs have probably all seen the movie given it being a classic film and really a great example of film-making overall. 

Hollywood is more than allowed to make another movie about a novel from the late 1800's that hasn't been touched for over 50 years. 

We get seemingly a half-dozen films a year based on some Young Adult Fiction series and they are all almost carbon-copies of each other from a story perspective. Adjust the setting and some minor tweaks here and there and you've got yourself a new series.

We've had countless movies about bible stories, including movies solely about Jesus. Dozens of films about famous Greek/Roman tragedies. Multiple versions of Shakespeare's works. They are all stories that are retold because of how well known they are and that they can still relate to us even today.

Not saying that this film will be great or anywhere near the original, but saying it should never have been made is silly.",2016-03-16T20:21:33.000Z,16
