- Documents the whole spaceship ride there and its pretty boring
- water machine breaks and he tries to fix it but hides it from mission control so they don't send him back
- water machine doesn't work and all water supply is contaminated so he lives off condensation
- admits that there's no water, mission control tries to get him back to earth but he overrides it and flies it to mars
 - he slowly becomes more unstable and stops communication with mission control
- ship is dying and he loses all hope in the mission
- lands on mars, takes a walk outside and the move ends with him standing on a rock

1. Escaping Earth's gravity is apparently like riding the bus. He looks bored. Maddox shows no effect of G force either.

2. You do not send ONE person on a Mars mission. Why is Maddox traveling three weeks behind him?

3. You cannot blast a huge spacelab into space - it would take multiple trips to get everything up there, and then you'd assemble it in space.

4. They're having conversations in realtime when there are huge gaps in distance between them which would have a time delay. Even from the moon there's a 3 second delay.

5. Why did they send two mentally unstable weirdos up to that other spacelab?

6. They have one dude looking in on him ""Hey buddy, I haven't checked on you in a few days how ya been?"" WTF??

7. Maddox' gyroscope fails, so they turn her around to come home? How? The fkn gyroscope doesn't work! There's no navigation computer? WTF?

8. Why couldn't he test his reactor in a lab instead of going out into the desert?

9. Why did they send only ONE reactor to Mars?",2016-06-04T18:48:07.000Z,4

2016-04-27T16:31:05.000Z,CQx2eosUlXY,"Approaching the Unknown Official Trailer #1 (2016) - Mark Strong, Luke Wilson Movie HD","Well, if I got to be honest, *FROM THE TRAILER* I get the impression that the people behind this movie don't really have a vision. It seems they're just taking things from the previous space films: ""Let's see, we'll have it serious and have the feel of Interstellar, it'll be a one-man show about someone isolated like in Gravity and Moon and... What? That Matt Damon movie about Mars is a hit? Alright, another reason for this to be a one-man show and let's put Mars in it, there.""

It doesn't seem to be its own thing. Imagine if when George Miller made Fury Road said: ""I don't really have a vision, it's just an action film with cars, roll with it."" we would probably have gotten some kind of  generic Fast & Furious-like thing.
...Best case scenario is that it's just crappy marketing that makes it feel like that when the actual movie is really its own thing.Unlike many biased Moon and Interstellar fanboys raging here in the comment section, I'll hold my judgement and give a fair chance to this film with an open mind instead of going into it with a ""Oh, it WON'T be as good as the film I love!!!"" it still can be a good film, dumbasses.",2016-05-15T17:09:59.000Z,1
