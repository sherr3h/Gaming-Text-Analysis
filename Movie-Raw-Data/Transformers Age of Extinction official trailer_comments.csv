I feel ashamed,  now that I watched the entire movie, for feeling so hyped about it in the first place, there are the amazing visuals you have to compliment, sure,  it has been on a whole nother level of CGI and sound,  but........ apart from that, nothing else. The story is legitimately utter garbage just crammed in somehow, seriously,  Optimus? Has that inventor put an earth magnet on your hard drive or something? You'd dare try to go to the place you killed Megatron for trying to bring back, AND try to fight the god knows how powerful being that is the planet Cybertron itself (the almighty Primus that essentially created the transformers)? I mean, if I took two days off,  dedicated my time to thorough research,   THEN created my own original Transformers movie storyline, I'd safely bet that for less amazing graphics,  I'd make a much MUCH cheaper and awesome movie line that appeals to all audiences.

Here's an idea.

Decepticons have gathered once again, but in much greater number, and launched an all out attack on Earth. This time they aren't trying to make humans their slaves but to kill them all with no exceptions as an act of revenge. 

Only a few Autobots have remained to defend people and It's obvious that they won't be able to succeed by themselves.

Sam decides to sacrifice his human form and turns into a Transformer himself knowing that's the only way to help Autobots defend against the horde of Decepticons. 

How would he do that? Optimus Prime hands Sam his Matrix and Sam stabs himself in the chest. Shortly after he falls down on the floor dead. He then starts to decompose into a billion of nanobots which then reassemble into a robotic organism that is Transformer. 

Sam (now a badass looking robot) continues to fight alongside Optimus and BumbleBee in an epic fight to save the Earth and the Humanity.",2015-08-02T14:48:01.000Z,13

2014-03-05T00:37:21.000Z,dYDGqmxMZFI,Transformers: Age of Extinction Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Michael Bay Movie HD,"I did enjoy this film, but the whole time I was watching it, I felt as though there was something missing from it - although there were MANY things it did better than all of its predecessors, it seemed as though it had lost some of its heart.
The dreadful ""comedy"" from the previous films is gone. The human characters are, generally speaking, much better this time around; I do miss Shia LaBeouf, but Mark Wahlberg plays a more heroic character who actually gets in on the action rather than hiding and screaming for Optimus or Bumblebee every five seconds. Meanwhile, Kelsey Grammer makes a great human antagonist while Stanley Tucci plays a fun, likeable and genuinely hilarious billionaire inventor. Lockdown is a genuinely compelling villain who brings tension to every scene he appears in. Optimus' character has changed from a righteous leader to an aged, weary and ruthless loner, having lost his faith in humanity throughout his time on Earth. The story - specifically, depicting humanity's discovery of 'Transformium' and Megatron's return in the form of Galvatron - is exciting and original, even if it disappoints many fans with the lack of Unicron (but heck, he's guaranteed to turn up sooner or later anyway). And speaking of the Transformers in general, there are only about 10 in total again, much more akin to the first film than the second and third (which each featured around 30).
But despite all this... I dunno. Where was the epic main theme, or the cheesy (but awesome and memorable) quotations? There wasn't even a single scene that seemed intended to provoke any form of sadness or emotion of any kind. Although the action was possibly the best the series has seen, the film's darker tone sometimes made it feel so flat and soulless that it actually started to bore me towards the end. 
If Michael Bay can find a compromise between the tones of this film and the previous ones for the next film then he'll be onto a winner, but with Age of Extinction I feel as though he tried so hard to make it more mature that he killed its spirit.",2014-07-22T12:10:13.000Z,0

It was actually about the Transformers themselves, each one of them had character. The story was engaging, the special effects were obviously jaw dropping, the characters were brilliant and cheesy, strong female characters, massively expanded universe with lots of exposition. The origins of the Transformers was explained, but left questions that may be revealed in the next installment.

The Autobots were each given loads of screen time, had plenty to say, Galvatron was amazing and sounded just like G1 Megatron, his story was amazing especially how he was the real one in control. Lockdown was a really great villain - ruthless, brutal, an utterly cold killer who was, refreshingly for a villain, ambivalent towards humans. Poor Ratchet and Leadfoot... their fates really made me hate Lockdown.

Michael Bay has outdone himself this time and has really breathed new life into Transformers. This film is completely different in tone to the previous three - Mark Wahlberg had a really good performance, his character was very relate-able and much easier to sympathise with than Sam Witwicky who I found obnoxious.

Of course it was cheesy, but it's Transformers so why would you expect otherwise? My jaw dropped, I got goosebumps, shivers down my spine. I was blown away by this film. Funnily enough though I watched the first Transformers film from 2007 and I said to myself ""this is stupid, it barely shows the Transformers! If only it showed them more, it would be amazing."" What do you know, this film truly delivered as a PROPER TRANSFORMERS FILM and I was not disappointed.",2014-07-05T21:04:24.000Z,49

Hell thats a big hint and tribute to the source material! It suggested the Quientessons,Unicron and Primus! Unlike T2 where the Transformers were born from Hatchlings, was a friggin stupid insult to the franchise...

For all you people who cant understand what is going in the story, man you guys are sure first time ignorant Transformer fans that need to read some Transformers lore especially Unicron... this movie had great shots of Optimus Prime..  they really gave him a role on his own instead of sucking up to Sam Witwicky...this was the only movie out of the 3 that gave Optimus Prime something to do instead of focusing all the roles on 1 stupid obnoxious kid..

Michael Bay actually did a good job on this movie.. he actually got all his Camera angles right.. there was shots and good time for the Transformers fight.. the people who said Transformers 1 was better, dont gimme me that shit.. you could barely see anything happening with all the bad mixed up shoots with humans blocking the fights which lasted a few seconds... this movie showed the Transformers actually fighting than showing Sam and his gf running through all the crap in the movie..",2014-07-01T06:43:39.000Z,11

I treat the transformers films as standalone movies. bloody critics said the first movie back in 06 sucked. I went and watched it and I enjoyed every minute of it. there is nothing as pathetic or as miserable as a critic in this world. born to whine and discredit peoples abilities, yet they themselves are so whack and pathetic that if criticism was a subject, they'd fail. Michael bay make those films. I will always support. Thank you ",2014-06-21T10:25:07.000Z,0

By making Optimus have the original truck look is great because they needed to go back to the original way the transformers was made.

Overall, I feel that people should give this movie a chance. It hasn't hit theaters yet so don't give your hopes up because of the trailer. Trust me, if it shows u a couple of cool scenes that you think are suppose to be surprises is actually hiding the greater surprises contained within the film.

2014-03-05T00:37:21.000Z,dYDGqmxMZFI,Transformers: Age of Extinction Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Michael Bay Movie HD,"Michael Bay replaced the dynamic of the (extremely) bad actor running around the explosions with his super model girlfriend, who is almost bad as an actress than the main character (maybe they are really soulmates?)... With the decent actor playing the role of the hard working father cliche... running around the explosions with his super model daughter.

Amazing, isn't it? This smells like crap from a mile away... Jesus, this franchise should be prohibited to being adapted by Michael Bay anymore. The Franchice NEEDS a rest, no more crappy movies to sell toys and bad actress careers.

And if you consider how good Pacific Rim just performed some months ago? With only one movie, Del Toro showed to the world how you properly do a giant robot adaptation. And the response of Michael Bay is this piece of trash? C'mon!",2014-03-06T18:33:38.000Z,0

I remember being psyched about the previews for Phantom Menace, and we all know how that turned out. Simple truth, this is Mikey Bay, and they've already started with the cliche lines like, ""don't mess with people from Texas,"" or whatever the Bostonian actor who sounds like he's from NY, while pretending to be a native Texan said. We all keep hoping for some 3 dimensional characters, dialogue and action from this guy, or hell even 2 dimensional would do at this point. But instead we get Shia screaming like a lunatic and parents with lines that wouldn't even sound natural coming from a pre-teen.

I understand they don't to gave out too much information about the movie but I was disappointed. Unlike the other trailers, the trailer of this movie show a lot of humans characters and less transformers. The Transformers don't talk especially Optimus Prime, Bumblebee is obviously not gonna to talk because he still using that stupid ratio voice in 2:00, the Transformers look really weird especially Bumblebee, Mark Wahlberg's character had talk in the entire trailer, the female lead character has no cuts or dirt marks on her face because Michael Bay is making her an eye candy and a damsel in distress, and the trailer really didn't make the movie more interesting because all the explosives and destructions are the same like the other Transformers trailers.

The only good thing happen in this trailer is the Dinobots of course, I mean Grimlock looks so badass but I hope they gave some actual personality and a lot of screen time but I doubt it because the 4th movie is going to be like the last two movies. More stupid unfunny jokes, more explosives, more stupid and boring human elements, more eye candy and weak female characters, and undeveloped and unnecessary romance.",2014-03-05T21:53:23.000Z,1

This should have never been about the human aspect anyway as it just became a distraction to the real characters which were the autobots and decepticons. When we used to watch the original animated series the transformers had very human attributes but somehow that got lost in translation. Maybe in a 5th installment the characters could be changed up again, and maybe even change up the transformers line up to not always be about Optimus Prime or Bumblebee or the usual suspects for a movie.",2014-03-05T11:45:56.000Z,0

But they say ""We don't need you anymore"" RIGHT BEFORE DECEPTICONS ARRIVE. Really, Bay? Goddamn it.

1) You should have gone with the father figure -&- daughter story for the original trilogy, using it now just makes you look like an idiot.

2) I don't understand the usefulness of Dinobots in general. I never have and I never will. Why would you want to turn into a pterodactyl to fight off an F-22? Impractical in almost every sense of the word.

3) As far as I've seen, the Decepticons are the enemy. AGAIN. Please refer to my opening statement for further reference as to why I believe this to be a completely wrong move for Bay.

For the most part; the sucker that I am, god damn me for it; I am INTRIGUED by this movie. It looks like Bay finally stopped with the denying the events in previous movies and is actually trying to build on a lore for once. If that's what he's trying to do with this one, then all the power to him.

But, what was with Optimus Prime that they want? So, I a hint of the bot, Galvatron, that Optimus tried to put down on the ground. I see Kelsey Grammer, Stanley Tucci, Bi Lingling, close views of Lockdown, Bumblebee with a new look, and the fleet of ships, outside of Earth's atmosphere, that were supposedly brought over there by the chaos bringer and the evil planet gobbling world, Unicron. But, here's what I don't understand: is Unicron ever going to appear in the film? Because I don't see the chaos god except for the ship that the bounty hunter Lockdown is commander of. I wonder if it must be the Decepticon warship, the Revenge. I have been waiting for this moment for a pretty long time, but is this all that Michael Bay could ever do while shooting the explosions and somewhat in those scenes? ",2014-03-05T02:05:59.000Z,0
