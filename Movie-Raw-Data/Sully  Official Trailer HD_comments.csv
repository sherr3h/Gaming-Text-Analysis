2016-06-29T23:30:38.000Z,mjKEXxO2KNE,Sully - Official Trailer [HD],"This is EXTREMELY inaccurate. US Airways 1549 occurred January 15 2009. The planes in the beginning are not from 2009. United Airlines DID NOT have the globe livery until 2010 when they (unfortunately) merged with Continental airlines. These two United planes should have continental written on the side of it. Yes they did fix this in the movie, BUT IT WAS STILL WRONG! Continental never had any ERJ 170s! They labeled the plane in the movie, Continental Connection, but continental connection only had a fleet of ATR‚Äôs and Q400‚Äôs (which one had been involved in Colgan Air 3407 [N200WQ]). The second huge mistake was also the American Airlines planes. THE LIVERY THEY WERE WEARING WAS FROM 2013-PRESENT! In 2009 they still wore the Chrome Livery of the silver paint! Everything at LaGuardia is screwed up in the movie. They somehow got the delta planes correct. (Except back then Delta Airlines was going through new livery repaints since 2008. So it would be unrealistic to see no Delta Airlines 2000s colors in the ‚ÄúDeltaflot‚Äù livery. They could have done a MUCH better job with this movie.",2018-09-27T21:32:54.000Z,0

Much of the plot of the film revolves around the NTSB investigators suggesting that Sully was not a good pilot because he decided to splash down in the Hudson instead of turning around for a landing back at LaGuardia airport or flying over the Teterboro airport in New Jersey.  Such a ruling would have forced him to take early retirement and lose his license to fly commercial airliners. They had computer simulations that ""proved"" that such an emergency landing could be easily done assuming he had a partially functional left engine.  Things looked bad for Scully for a while, but then some facts emerged that the NTSB had been conveniently concealing.  I don't want to spoil this excellent film by revealing them.  But, I'll just say this.  If you are ever on a airliner when all of the engines fail at once, you'll be glad to have Scully at the controls!",2017-02-23T02:54:56.000Z,0

The Terminal well if you take Tom Hanks on trip with  you, you only make it as far as the airport. Captain Philips, well they got ambushed coz bloody Tom Hanks was their captain.

They are making this a blockbuster for the masses, but pilots now are so abused they dont even make enough money to pay off the debts of their schooling. Pilots have to take second jobs as store clerks to pay their bills. A pilots wife HAS to have a job, her husband cannot keep her to be a full time stay at home mother to his children on a pilots wage! No chance! No pilots ever want their own sons or daughters because of how shit it has become as a career now. And Sully himself tried to raise awareness of this (while he had the keys to the city of NY and was the medias ""hero""), only to be silenced by that same media instantly.

BUT NOW they make a movie, showing him a hero again.

What about his message? What about the changes he wants? What about that, then?

Hanks has a habit of playing so called heroes, like on Apollo 13, the heroes were the techs on the ground devising a means to try to save 3 peoples lives. The astronauts were victims of a bad situation.

When a surgeon is about to close up a chest, there is a check-list that the surgeons follow which evolved and borrowed heavily from entities like the FDA and various locals and their experience with consumer safety.

You could go back as far as Turkish Airlines flight 981 in 1974 with 346 casualties to the Tenefire Disaster in 1977 with 583 casualties to the 2001 Twin Tower attacks with 2,665 casualties on the flights alone to the 2011 Buffalo crash with 50 casualties....The bottom line is.. when %@$# hits the fan, and all hope is lost, maybe... MAYBE the pilot can resort to his experience and training and save some lives..MAYBE he's able to, amidst the chaos, keep his cool enough to save as many people as he can.... Capt. #SULLY is a HERO... HE may not see himself as such, but I am sure the passengers and family on that ""Miracle in the Hudson"" flight sure count their blessings when they consider him as the captain and man in charge of that flight.",2016-09-10T07:30:18.000Z,0

8.5/10, Great movie! But i get lost at the flashbacks, Movie starts off post accident,  Then flashback to the accident, Then post accident, Then the actual accident that many people came to see, Then movie end in final investigation, It was very hard to tell if it was a flashback or not, Why not just start the movie like normal? Pre-accident, The main part of the movie, Then end with post accident and investigation? I'm not sure why it wasn't directed that way but it was still a good movie, But i did get lost where flashbacks begun.",2016-09-10T06:25:44.000Z,0

2016-06-29T23:30:38.000Z,mjKEXxO2KNE,Sully - Official Trailer [HD],"To hell with Eastwood, he's nothing but a whiny pro-Trump has-been. Fuck him. Sullenberger was annoying regardless if he asked for all this or not. I remember all the hullabaloo surrounding the incident, this wasn't that long ago. Sullenberger milked his heroism way too long, when to my mind landing a plane safely in the water is more than tough, but it's kinda the goal in being a fucking pilot. A captain should care about their passengers. I mean, a real hero wouldn't call themselves a hero. For all we know, this story could be a lie. Sullenberger could have been a coward and never told the real story? But it's made by white people, so it's okay to be credulous and not question anything. ""It's just a movie"" Cool, then I should have the freedom to feel it's more jingoist propaganda.

Pilots land planes safely everyday, but everyone feels a plane crashing is never possibility. It is every time you get on one. But the fact it all happened in a sensitive post-9/11 New York makes this even more Heroic American Porn for all the historically uneducated to jerk off to. That's all Sullenberger was to the media, they used his image as a trope, as way to make money and profess how great we are as a nation. Makes me want to puke. This hardly deserves to be a full feature film, as Sullenberger and Eastwood don't have anything real to say other than more patriotic-fetishism nonsense. I get it. Sully did a good thing, great, so did thousands of other Americans. Where's their movie deals? I'm not shit posting, trolling, or whatever. Hate me all you want, this is just my honest opinion.",2016-09-10T05:52:47.000Z,1

People so often forget the responsibility a pilot in command has and everyone wants to be the one to tell him what he did wrong.  How about talk about what he did right and how his training kicked in and he made the best practical decision he could come up with at the time of the failures.  No matter how much experience you have in aviation, if you lose both engines at 2800ft ASL I don't care who you are but your probably not going to even consider turning back to the airport, you can waste time doing that, you work with what you have and what he had was the Hudson.",2016-09-05T00:41:07.000Z,0

They did their jobs- investigating all angles- and concluded that the pilots were not at fault. The NTSB is supposed to find out exactly what happened and how to keep it from happening again. If either pilot /were/ responsible, even partially, there would be lessons to draw which might save people in the future. Declining to consider the possibility just because the public was already convinced that Sully was a hero would have been dereliction. I know the movie needs an antagonist of sorts, but if the board is portrayed as some evil conniving government-corporatist force actively trying to railroad the crew it will be disappointing.",2016-08-24T21:51:58.000Z,0

2016-06-29T23:30:38.000Z,mjKEXxO2KNE,Sully - Official Trailer [HD],"Sully! SULLY!!! WE MADE IT SULIVAN. Hard to be excited about a movie that anyone who watched the news would already know the outcome, just a bunch of less interesting bullshit filler in between, at least the pilot played by Denzel was a hardcore alcoholic, which ads more interest in the after climatic moment of the plane landing. Sully walks away a hero, everybody lived. I think the news segment was more dramatic than this. Must have been the least difficult script to write out of any movie as the majority of the movie is the investigation, which I am sure is so completely structured, intensely written and rehearsed that all they had to do was get a manual for investigating ¬†an aircraft crash to write the script. O no, there might be problems at home!! I bet Sully and his wife in real life had a pretty average life and relationship. If you read this Tom Hanks you probably should have stayed stuck on skull island than to have¬†made this unoriginal money grab. It will probably only attract the millions of old people who are news junkies, I guess it's still a buck tho?

I also just noticed something else at 0:20:
If the events took place in 2009, then why am I seeing an American Eagle CRJ painted in American's new livery (the new livery was introduced in 2013)?  Did the CRJ somehow teleport to 2009?  I don't think so.  Hollywood needs to do some research.

But other than that, I want to see this movie!",2016-07-18T02:35:24.000Z,0

FAA NEVER went after him saying he could have landed at another airport.   They did simulator testing on that and found,  nearly 50% of the time IF the pilot KNEW what was going on, expected the twin engine failure, and diverted RIGHT after impact they could land at another airfield.   The difference though was 23 seconds.  IF the pilot did ANYTHING including follow a check list and/or try a restart, or anything else.   that was it...  they could not do it.

There was also NEVER a suggestion that one of the engines was still running.   the black boxes showed that right off the bat.

infact 1 thing sully did right away, was a make or break choice that ONLY 20% of tested pilots did.  Without going to the checklist, he immediately turned on his APU.  this one kept his radios and computers going.   

face it they are over-dramatizing.

2016-06-29T23:30:38.000Z,mjKEXxO2KNE,Sully - Official Trailer [HD],"Woe to all the wicked - July 01, 2016

Do not fear the wicked. They will not get away with their wickedness forever, although they believe and think that they will. It is because they have no true knowledge of Me, only deception. 

I am the God of Love but also a Consuming Fire to My adversaries. It will be a terrible thing for all the wicked to fall into My Hands. A Day is coming when all will bear the consequences for their foolishness, their evil deeds, unless they all repent.

Woe to all the wicked who do not repent in time. There will be no mercy without true remorseful repentance. It is not My will that anyone perish but that all repent to have eternal life but it is up to each and every one to repent, to live your lives worthy and pleasing to Me or bear the consequences. I love and I care for all, I find no pleasure in the death of a sinner.

I am holy and you must all change, be transformed into My likeness, because without holiness no one will see Me. I did not change. The unrighteous will not inherit My everlasting Kingdom. Do not be deceived.

Woe to all those who justify wickedness, who do not only approve of those things that I hate that are an abomination to Me but do them themselves also. I will repay, vengeance is Mine.

Woe to all those who call evil good and good evil, who mock and scoff Me because they have no fear and no reverence for Me for who I really am and for what I am able to do. I am the righteous Judge the only One who is able to throw into hell. Be wise, repent and know Me for real. I will judge each one fairly and justly for your deeds.",2016-07-01T19:01:57.000Z,0

Flight was nothing but pure fiction... for you millennials ""Fiction"" means that it didn't happen, that its all made up.  In fact, the movie Flight is not only fiction, its fantasy, inverted flight in a jet liner is almost fucking impossible under the conditions the movie presented... it was also more about alcoholism and Denzel being Denzel than anything else.  This movie is an account of actual events, of an actual pilot who accomplished one of the most amazing forced landings in all of aviation history.  99% of the people commenting about ""Flight"" are probably not even sport pilots, much less private pilots, much less commercial pilots, much less career aviators.

I heard he read accident reports in his freetime to learn from people's mistakes and become a better pilot. He knew the first 10 minutes after rotating of the ground is the most dangerous situation to be in. I'd say a vast majority of plane incidents happen within a half mile to a mile from the airport. I can guarantee he thought about landing in the Hudson hours before the flight, not intentionally, but to be prepared if his engines were to die.

Also, some people are saying: ""who cares? He only landed in the Hudson River."" First of all, if he hadn't landed the plane in the correct way the plane would have cart wheeled and killed every one on board. Second of all, those planes aren't meant to land in water, and third: those people would have frozen to death in the river within fifteen minutes. And I know what your probably thinking if you made it this far into my paragraph: ""well doesn't that mean that he was endangering the lives of his passengers that he is sworn to protect?"" Yes he is endangering their lives, but at least he isn't endangering even more lives by landing on the streets.

 It's called being professional, and getting mad respect for maintaining during a situation.


Man, this fakeass hero-worship bullshit hype like someone went above and beyond, it's just doing what needs be done. Find some real heros like William Carpenter

Even KTEB was impossible. Best I could possibly do was a water landing on final approach to KLGA runway 13, and that was some tedious as all hell gliding to get it just right to get that close. You couldn't hesitate for even a second at the bird strike location to get that close. In my opinion, Captain Sullenberger made the right call.
