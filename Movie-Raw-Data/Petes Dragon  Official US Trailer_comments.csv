So many people are deceived and allowing their kids to be deceived by disney. Why in the world would an innocent little child who is afraid of a ""boogeyman"" in the closet admire a dragon? Yet they are brainwashed to, in order to desensitize and condition kids to be okay with a ""beast system"" (as the bible calls the world system of the end times) and the devil. First it was the fairy tales that copied the details of the bible by having a princess representing the ""bride of Christ"", an unnamed prince representing Jesus Christ the "" Prince of Peace"" who is prophesied to slay the monster called ""Leviathan"" and throw the devil into the ""Lake of Fire"", and also of course by having a dragon which represents the devil....Now they are going full mind control by pushing the ""dragons are good"" agenda, Satanism at its finest. Satan always want to copy God and turn things upside down. Wake up people, you are supporting a ""beast system"". Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Yes He is real, He is more real than you. You just have to repent (turn away from your sins) and accept Him so that you will no longer be the old you, but be born again with His Spirit living in you.",2018-11-25T21:12:53.000Z,0

The boy is kidnapped from his home in the woods (where he was happy and healthy!) by this creepy family, taking him away from his dragon, who raised him! The dragon goes looking for him and is super sad, and the boy trusts this awful family to take him to see the dragon the next day. And as soon as the dragon comes out to greet them all in the woods he is SHOT repeatedly with drugs and chained up and captured and treated HORRIBLY. And the man responsible for this NEVER gets his comeuppance. The dragon when finally escapes is almost captured again and he is told by the boy NOT to hurt them! Why not? And the worst part is after all this the boy decides to abandon the dragon and live with this disgusting family!!! I hated it! The dragon was so sweet and the humans are egoic idiots who think that they know the right way to live and the boy doesn't, and that justifies kidnapping him and almost killing the dragon who raised him. Hated hated hated it >:(",2018-07-29T20:00:06.000Z,6

It's just a complete INSULT that have could've been better if it NEVER happened. The original was pretty much kinda like Who Framed Roger Rabbit before it was made with both live-action and 2D animation combined, and turned into a musical. But THIS, however, has NO live-action mixed with 2D animation, is not musical, and felt like the new Jungle Book mixed with How To Train Your Dragon... ALONG WITH THE ATROCIOUS NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET REMAKE. The original movie was pretty cheesy, I know, but think about it, many people actually LIKED, or other words, LOVED cheesy movies back in the olden days if they had entertaining or enjoyable moments, and plus, the original was pretty much one of the only GOOD THINGS from the 70s apart from Star Wars and Garfield. THIS MOVIE, in other cases, was one of the MOST AWFUL THINGS from 2016, it's just completely FUCKED BEYOND BELIEVE. Seriously, if you actually want to watch a actual GOOD remake or reboot of a movie, I request you probably watch Shin Godzilla.",2017-05-20T15:44:55.000Z,0

Why don't you just watch it, and then make up your own mind? Stop worrying about how much money it made, or what other people thought of it, or what its box office ratings were like, etc etc etc. People are obsessed with slating films before they've even given them a chance, just because they aren't 'arthouse', or because they know someone that didn't like it, or because they read something negative in the YouTube comments section, or whatever.

He doesn't look anything like Elliot from the cartoon... If you're gonna make a remake of something, at least keep the correct details of the original character! If you're going for a different look, then maybe changing the art style on certain parts, but damn... keep what was already there in the first place. 

I'm still gonna watch this movie though. It's just the design is so different and it doesn't look like Elliot.",2017-02-21T09:28:37.000Z,0

Dragons are reptiles and reptiles are supposed to be scaly-skinned. The only hair that Elliot should have is on the top of his head and the tip of his tail. And I think they had Elliot look too big.,2017-02-09T23:56:13.000Z,0

This film is truly representation of family entertainment and it just has that 90s vibe to it being simple, short and modest, but also having a huge heart and great dragon as protagonist. Filmmakers did a fine job in giving this dragon life, personality and his character just shines in this film and you can't help but to fall in love with him. Young Pete was also charming young actor and supporitng cast does a nice job, it is very clean, some will say ecological film with great visuals, cinematography and score. Film may  end up looking cliche and recycled, but execution is what matters and in my opinion they created another christmas classic sure to be played during the holidays in the future. 3.5/5",2016-11-20T16:44:16.000Z,1

The script was undeveloped, the kid was a horrible actor, the fact that he didn't lose touch with his native tongue and start speaking dragon instead of his native tongue, etc'. Be kind to yourself people, don't waste $10.00 or whatever it costs in your area to see this ""movie"". Disney should feel ashamed of itself for putting half-done crud like this out on the silver screen.",2016-08-30T03:20:21.000Z,0

That took balls Disney and you get bonus points for making him furry. All he needs is a pair of purple whiskers on the snout to make him perfect. And for those who whine that Elliot was not a Chinese dragon I recommend listening to the lyrics of 'It's not easy' from the original movie. The description of the dragon in that song is straight from Chinese mythology!Thank you Disney.

Guys, it's okay for a story to be re-interpreted as long as its essence and its heart remains the same, and I really think we're going to see that here.  The Jungle Book was *excellent.*  Have a little faith <3

Also, I'm a total dragon nerd but I'm personally psyched to see a fluffy dragon.  It doesn't have to be fur when feathers or pseudo-feathers are a possibility as well.  There are so many scaley firebreathing lizards out there while softer/feathered beauties like the coatyl go unnoticed and unloved.

He certainly was not meant to be a beautiful dragon. To make 2016 Elliot furry is a perfect idea, because it still makes him adorable and can be scary if need be. If they put nothing but scales on him then he would NOT be adorable, he would just looks like a beautiful dragon such as Saphira from Eragon, and he just wasn't that kind of dragon in the original. Plus all of you should know by now that remakes tend to change the original (sometimes drastically), and should really be used to it by now ;)

What's next fucking aladdin, the sword in the stone, Mulan? I just don't like the fact that they are being remade for no reason, and the worst part about it is that the films are from the same company but some are completely different genres the worst being the jungle book a super iconic children's film and a musical comedy but now the new one has the same kind of general idea (adapted from the same book) but bares non of the same iconic material as the first.  I'm not saying that these weren't/aren't going to be good films I personally quite liked the new jungle book.  Its the fact that they have the exact same title now if I want to watch the original bfg film I have to remember the year it was released and then it's still flooded with the new one it's just a little bit of a hassle. 


P.S I think you may have dropped the scripts for Pete's dragon and the jungle book on the floor and muddled them up a bit like when the fuck did Pete turn into a feral child.",2016-06-16T23:42:12.000Z,2

First off, the film was truly scary, since the stakes were literally as high as they could be for both Pete and Elliott. Pete was being pursued by a crazy inbred family that wanted to go back to beating and torturing him as a slave, and Elliott was being hunted by a scary film-flam artist that wanted to kill him and use all his body parts for tonics and potions! As for the music, every song is a classic, or at the very least well constructed, and I remember them as well as any other Disney classic. But the real star was Elliott, who absolutely felt a million times more real than this misguided CGI fur-beast.",2016-06-15T23:44:07.000Z,0

Looking at the dragon itself it's... er... not too well designed and is something a kid would come up with after watching HTTYD and playing a game of Halo. ""An amphibious dragon with active camo!!!11""

Other than that I already know the plot:

They discover a ""lost child"" who's been gone for X years and finally comes back to civilization. Shock! Awe! He couldn't POSSIBLY have survived out in the wilderness on his own(Plothole btw)! Wait, what's that? He was raised by a DRAGON!?

And from there the sequence of events that unfold in these movies: Somebody either thinks it's too dangerous OR wants to utilize it as weapon, they enter a conflict stage where the human people try to get the ""bad guys"" off it's back, showdown stage where they almost capture it, but the dragon escapes thanks to the boy's miraculous control over the dragon. Bad guy is killed, falling bridge style, and they all live happily ever after.

Honestly they've been rehashing this same plot throughout their recent movies, and I guarantee it'll happen with BFG.",2016-06-15T10:39:38.000Z,27

2016-06-14T16:00:02.000Z,fPOamb6d_20,Pete&#39;s Dragon - Official US Trailer,"there are many ways Disney could screw this up, but I swear if they focus too much on the wrong thing I'll be over it's live action movies. if they want us to ""discover the wonder"" of this movie they're giving us, then they should study the older movies, like snow white, Cinderella and Peter Pan. they have been SO focused on ""we need to make these older things look new and cooler!"" need proof? watch Jungle Book. it's forty percent focused on the story, which isn't very good in Disney standards, and sixty on CGI and ""bringing these characters to life"". TOO. MUCH. NOT CARING ABOUT IMPORTANT THINGS.
 I swear Walt Disney is turning in his grave over new Disney movies. if you look back at his old movies, they are SOOOOOO different from newer ones. take Cinderella for instance. a girl who's misunderstood by her family gets what she's always wished for at a price. it's a story we've seen a million times, even back when it was made, but it works! why? because Walt Disney didn't focus too much on making the movie so appealing to certain audiences or about remaking things. he cared about showing only the people who had an actual reason to be there. the things we saw in those older movies, in a characteristic perspective, were things that no one had ever seen before, and were interesting, magical, and important. think of any old movie made by Disney himself. now think of characters in that movie who didn't have a reason to be there. mind blown.
If new Disney wants to make a movie, and I mean the first fantastic one they've made in a long time, they need to go in the opposite direction of where they're going now. DO NOT focus on bring old characters into the 21st century. sure it looks and feels cool but it doesn't last. it's like making a new candy, and then making a smoothie version. it lasts way longer, and you can enjoy it long term instead of just eating it, and being done. no one above the age of sixteen cares about old being rethought. absolutely no one.",2016-06-15T06:21:56.000Z,0

From what little I do recall he behaved like a friendly big dog more then a dragon that explains the face.

(I feared they'd try and make him look like one of Daenerys' dragons, in an effort to make a ""darker and more serious"" film. xD) Looks as though they went the more middle-ground, How-to-Train-Your-Dragon-esque route. Can't help feeling that the first Elliot will have more personality and this'll be another by-the-numbers, forgettable, uninspired story. I guess it has a little potential, but honestly, this is what I'd been expecting Brave to be: adults gang up on child's/teen's ""dangerous"" animal friend, like Gaston's angry mob on the Beast...main character and allies have to protect it from those who don't understand it...yadda.",2016-06-15T01:07:41.000Z,0

If someone had told me that this was directed by Steven Spielberg or J.J. Abrams (who directed ""Super 8"" which felt very much like a Spielberg film), I would believe them. Looks like David Lowery is certainly someone to keep an eye on as this film looks visually stunning. It's no wonder that they are entrusting him with Disney's future ""Peter Pan"" live-action adaptation. I'm liking the small nods to the original with the phrase ""I Saw A Dragon"" at the end, and the capture of Elliot. I could almost see this as more of a sequel to ""Pete's Dragon"" seeing as it takes place in a modern Pacific Northwest forest as opposed to the coastal town of Passamaquoddy, Maine in the early 19th century. Lest we forget, at the end of the original film Elliot left to help another kid in trouble. I hope the film includes nods to the songs that won't be included, or that ""Candle On The Water"" at least be played during the end credits. So far, this looks to be a fun family adventure at any rate. :) ",2016-06-15T00:37:56.000Z,0

Disney why are you teaching kids that only the fuzzy wuzzy animals deserve love?

I can't wait to see more of what the director of this movie does for Disney, because we know Disney loved what the director did with this movie so much, that they hired him to write and direct an upcoming ""Peter Pan"" remake, which will hopefully be better than the awful ""Pan"" from 2015.",2016-06-14T16:18:59.000Z,29
