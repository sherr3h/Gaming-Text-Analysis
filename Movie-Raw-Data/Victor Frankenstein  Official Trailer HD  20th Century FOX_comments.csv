I read the original novel for english class when I was still in school and I absolutely loved it. The only frankenstein movie I have seen (which I saw after reading the book) is the one with Helena Bonham Carter that version does stay quite true to the novel but there are some notable deviations but it doesn't entirely ruin the film for me. The direction by kenneth branagh of it though does really affect it in a bad way, It feels more like an opera than a horror story. I heard that guillermo del toro wants to make a frankenstein movie at some point if he does end up making it I hope it says true to the book and has the right tone",2016-07-05T14:05:56.000Z,0

SPOILERS



The parts of the book that leave the strongest impression on people are lost completly.
Do we see the monster struggling with searching a meaning for his lone life, abandoned by his creator, hated by everyone?
No we get a dumb aggressive meatsack.
Do we feel Frankenstein's pain and doubts? The pain he feels over the loss of the love of his life by the hands of his creation? and the possiblity that he could create a race of savages that could exterminate humanity?
No.
We just get a wild manbeast who is dealt with quickly and without any major problem.
Do we get the feeling that frankenstein is in the search of something new, not meant to known to men, and the horror when he realises it?
No...
Instead we get, a misguided crusader pursuing him. (That makes all of the above impossible. If he is in the search of such thing, a detective - or any other person for the matter - would have no clue what he is doing. What is even worse, that the only harm he is in the way, is the aggression of the said cop.)

SO PLEASE NO MORE ADAPTATIONS!",2015-11-30T22:17:08.000Z,4

Played Half for laughs with a bit of buddy movie throw in. On top of this i suppose the film will be driven by special effects. I get the feeling that i have seen this film many times over recent years under a different title. The art of scaring people without special effects seems to be lost. This looks like a horror version ¬†of the latest Sherlock Holmes films. Take out everything that made the characters interesting in the first place and replace it with what.

Nowadays, the ""Monster"" is always this evil unintelligent creature who only destroys. In the original novel, the monster was a sentient creature who felt the world was beautiful and wondered why he was the only ""hideous"" creature. He really wanted to live with other people and even taught himself to speak and read. He only ever ate berries and nuts. He always tried to make friends with people but they would always fear him and hunt him so in the end he gave up hope and decided to be the ""monster"" that the people thought he was. Maybe someday in the future someone will decide to go back to the roots of Frankenstein and his monster. Anyways cool trailer!",2015-08-19T01:41:06.000Z,9

there's no need to dilute and defile the depth of the original narrative with all this action and spectacle. kind of disappointed that this is the direction that the director chose to take...",2015-08-18T23:31:40.000Z,0

I feel the characters need to switch hairdos or something, Mcavoy can pull off hair like that, but not Radcliffe. Don't be fooled, it may look like a 'Guy Richie' production but it ain't, and the music sounds very 'Hans Zimmer', but it ain't.

2015-08-18T12:59:45.000Z,7pxZxY_Siyc,Victor Frankenstein | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"It looks like it's trying to be to the Frankenstein stories what Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr. were to the Sherlock Holmes stories. And it looks like it's trying too hard.

Also, I've never read the original novel or seen any Frankenstein movie (I did buy the one with Kenneth Brannaghand Robert Deniro from the $5 movie bin last night though if that counts but haven't watched it yet) so correct me if I'm wrong, but... were fans of the original work really clamoring to see the bromance between Igor and Victor expanded upon? And was the original work this light hearted and filled with funny one-liners? Again, haven't read the novel but I highly doubt it was.

I like both the main actors in this movie, but the entire trailer just makes the movie seem not only like a lazy cash grab, but a disservice to a great novel that has inspired the imagination of millions. Now I hope I'm wrong, because I have been wrong before (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street, Kung Fu Panda) but I've also been right before (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(2014), Fant4stic).
