We can only go with the information we‚Äôre given, so giving bad information to the audience is a cheap and childish way to create a ‚Äútwist‚Äù in the plot.",2019-06-08T23:19:42.000Z,0
2016-08-16T14:00:03.000Z,tFMo3UJ4B4g,Arrival Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"The movie questions our linear concept of time, this business of starting from the beginning and stopping at the end. But what if time could be bent, shaped, moulded, to fit our purpose? If we could make choices about the present from the future and feel the impact of future choices in the present? This amorphous, flexible nature of time.

Hence, in keeping with this theme, the movie doesn't have a strictly linear sequence of events - all are beautifully and complexly juxtaposed, one on the other. 
Recognising this requires paying careful attention, as when Louise says to Ian, ""I just realised why my husband left me,"" even though she was speaking to the one who would become that husband; or while in a trance from the future told her daughter (who was yet unborn) that ""her father left because she told him what he wasn't ready to hear""; or when Louise averts a global war due to insights she gained from the future with her now fully-formed ability for time-bending, and many such scenarios peppered throughout this captivating movie.

She doesn't always have the answers even in the future and many times has to fill these blank spaces with updated knowledge from the present; such instances as the identity of her husband, providing her daughter with the answer to a Science question, and how she came about the ability to gain insights from the future. The future gains from the present just as equally as the present profits from the future. It isn't one way, linear; it's cyclical.

Then the denouement, when Louise asks Ian, if knowing how his life will play out, he would change anything. The zinger of a question that makes us consider the security that our linear universe provides - the protection that comes from not knowing, free from the nerve-wracking pressure of deciding present and future fates.",2019-06-21T19:20:32.000Z,10

The first hour was really cool and I was pretty hooked on the whole concept of establishing communication with the aliens, but the second half was extremely boring. I figured out the plot twist a long time before it happened; hints were being dropped left and right. A good plot twist is one that catches you off guard, or at least isn't so obvious that it erases any other possible scenarios from your mind. But this twist was so obvious that if you didn't figure it out a half hour before the movie executed it, you just weren't paying attention. Seriously, the entire second half was just ""yea saw that coming... uh huh... yep knew it"". By time the twist actually happened I was already over it, which was disappointing because the first half had me really excited. I just feel it was made too obvious.
 
To the guy in the comments who compared this to Interstellar, predictability is what separates them and makes Interstellar a much better movie, not necessarily the visuals. Anybody who tells you they saw the Interstellar plot twist coming is a liar. Much better execution there. Just my opinion.",2019-02-18T01:29:27.000Z,0

The two main characters, played by the ever stone-faced Forest Whitaker and Amy Adams compete with each other throughout the movie to see which ""actor"" can maintain a blank look on their faces for the most scenes. Amy's character is noteworthy for of course being the smartest person in the room filled with military men and scientists, she's the only one who can decipher the alien language, which she accomplishes mostly by having flashbooks to her girlhood scenes of wandering around fields and exploring ponds. She spends most of the movie looking sad or stoned on antidepressents, blank-faced in every scene, with the other characters keep asking ""how are you feeling?"" This movie had great potential and was an interesting concept, but very poorly executed by mis-cast leading roles. Apparantly it's difficult to cast such gurl-power movies but there must be an actress somewhere with more dynamic range than a turnip, though none were hired for this disappointing movie.

I understood the movie and analyzed it before reading and I‚Äôm glad I did. It was fun seeing people‚Äôs take on it. I also learned three things I didn‚Äôt notice or know in the movie. Like the alien ship inspired by the rectangle ship in Stanley Kubricks alien film. And I didn‚Äôt analyze certain things in the film that were hidden meanings or short reveals inspired by things like the tentacles of the aliens being the star symbol for power, communication etc and the ink circles being like the snake circle symbol about life and death and the ships shape being like an eye concave/convex or like a contact lens possibly implying ‚Äúeye‚Äù as in open your eyes humans...and then open your minds then open your hearts.

2016-08-16T14:00:03.000Z,tFMo3UJ4B4g,Arrival Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"I enjoyed the film. A bit very repetitive and slow with the scenes of the circles probably to get you to feel what the linguists is feeling and fed up with as well. But I love how people on here are saying they weren‚Äôt confused about the movie as if seeking assurance and acknowledgment that  they are intelligent üòÇ. It‚Äôs not about weather you understood it or not because it can be very subjective and not trying to be one meaning for all but leaving room for your imagination of how you want to perceive the film. Yes it has one goal, to explain or imply that it‚Äôs about communication and altering or not being able to alter, events that will happen because it‚Äôs life and life happens in mysterious ways that we as humans still don‚Äôt not understand but like to believe that we have the power to do so and that anything we do can affect and cause a chain reaction and repercussions. The movie was clear what it wants you to perceive but leaves room for you to make up your own mind. It doesn‚Äôt want you to exactly know what it‚Äôs hinting at. That‚Äôs up to the vision of the creator/writer and their take. Everyone has a different take on life and meaning and understandings and ultimately in the way we communicate. Just like the title of movie can Imply and be a deep communication to us the importance of the arrival of Louis daughter is to her more than her death (departure). The movie does not clearly reveal or hint at ‚Äútime travel‚Äù or understanding the future past or present for that matter but left to the viewer to interpret what it‚Äôs revealing just as the aliens are trying and wanting humans to do. Maybe that is the artistic metaphor and deep meaning of the movie and it‚Äôs goal. To have the viewers try to decipher the film as the characters. If the movie was sooo clear as many on here state it was and feel they are sooo intelligent, then why did you come to this section in commentary and look up videos of ‚Äúending explained‚Äù in the first place? I bet it was to reassure themselves because they second guessed the endings meanings. Because the film was not clear and it was intentional in the first place!!! But that‚Äôs just my opinion. I feel the overall movies message was communication within humanity is essential. We may all be divided by location but we should not be with our understanding, our ideals, morals. How our initial impulse is to mistrust anything as not have hope or the right impulse to understand...come together. While humans themselves as intelligent as we are and have the gift to be able to be and mend many problems are so incompetent in the end and will be instrumental in the cause of the end of us and the world. After all, we are only humans.Just as Louis sketches the word and is significant. How easy it is for us but hard we make it to come together as one in a desperate time and put our differences aside and save us especially from ourselves.",2018-06-16T20:41:14.000Z,0

There is always the ""we don't care what the experts think, let's act like idiots"" types in charge. The communication with the aliens is super complex but suddenly quite simple when it needs to be. The whole seeing-the-future-theme took a nice turn on the plot around the daughter but overall without even an attempt of an explanation it didn't quite fit the movie.

I should probably add that i'm being hyper-critical. It's still easily a 9/10 movie compared to what's in the theaters recently.",2018-02-17T23:19:40.000Z,0

I think those that failed science in school watched this movie and in their delusion they thought, 'I'm smarter than a nuclear physicist because I saw something that doesn't exist in a pointless horrible scripted movie - no need for school and shit, I'm all out there in my thought process.'

I wish they could've made it a little more interesting like something like a loss baby alien came to earth from a space pod. The adult aliens evade earth trying to find their child. Amy Adams trying to learn their sign language for why they evade earth. If the adult aliens doesn't find their child, they will destroy the earth.

3. I dont watch trailers to films anymore. Trust me. I watched this movie before I'd seen anything about it. No trailers no nothing. I can tell you now the experience was completely different. From seeing the aliens for the first time, to slowly understanding the plot line as the characters do, to seeing their language signs for the first time not knowing what to expect. People who watched the trailer would already know all these things. Its not the same experience. Trust me . Dont watch trailers anymore guys.

@1:41 pause our only hope then is Salvation, look to Jesus see the red pen/soul on the ruler T-square, thats the feedback
see the crescent moon on underneath it, see the distant one with the octopus on top, see the faded light. they block the light coming in, because they hate the light & the light is God  John 12:46
1:44-1:45 ""We need to make sure they understand the difference between a weapon & a tool""
1:44 The US Army, The Army Borg & America a weapon Right back side of skull, weapon
1:45 The guy in planing room in front of white-board is the finger of Horus that tells where souls go, he is a tool
stone & left side, spirit medium for seat of soul & tool. not the entity that assumes control just the vehicle or mouse
 Van-back opens, they use weapons to shoot weapons, the octopus at back of skull
@1:46 pause see that, octopus @ back of skull or (mama) the arms reaching around to block the light thats the weapon preparing mapping the path see the words on right, thats the tool  mapping your brain, why all this trouble (intel is inside)
then configures the world around you to from food to encounters for the fall of stone & morals, any kinds of sin& crime based on where u are in life.  i'm in a good place i think, only food wars & stoking anger & trying to provoke lies
1:48 like i said the language is messy & sometimes one can be both. as in the double meanings & the soul, they can read a soul as dark but yet still when they kill it doesn't go to them.  cool & saved, lukewarm Christian i guess. Thats because the mercies of GOD & salvation is instant , no processing time,  Jesus did the work already u only need to align yourself to eternity, choose him & thank God.
1:52-1:54  ""are u dreaming in their language""  they may speak in dreams or try to prod us in our sleep, thats when most the attacks take place, they know when your sleeping cause the tool can read you thoughts
1:55-2:05 personal front . Its possible they're prodding us to fight amongst ourselves""  Yes to know for sure that u are a dark soul & lower your spiritual vibration,  See the Space ship over bright skies the battle ship, then Helicopter over dark skies leaving the base, your soul change. 
 ""Maybe there just trying to get us to work together"" Yes not e the screen with  many faces all under the same light, takeover of you social & professional network to narrow your interactions & prospects to their control & channels,
 ""Its more complicated than that"" nope these ppl will be able to read u with the tool & communicate tempt or manipulate you accordingly.
""Russia just executed one of their own to keep their secrets"" or keep u in line, intimidated & afraid, Doppelg√§nger ppl with similar names, image , features, all to bring down your vibrational level & lower your spirit for easy takeover.
Y ""because sometimes one can be both"" if they can access they still wont eat unless u will got hell.
1:55-2:05
On the political front its very literal & as presented, they control all media channels, news is propaganda for their war narratives & they will kill their own to instigate that, because they feed on negative energy & can easy pop back their hell-spawn into another body
remember men in black 1, when they visit the morgue & open the dudes face. thats what they do with their own & thats why murder & mayhem means nothing to them.  no one ever really does & they will start wars to just to mass murder saved souls or  unsaved ppl before they find  GOD
2:06-2:08 ""We got 21 hours"" are you ready for your close up: see the space ship/now a tentacle looking at the soul & positioning itself for the big gulp,
2:09-2:12 ""so how do we clarify their intentions"" or how do u get taken ""
1) ""I go back in, or get swallowed if cold & hell bound, little girl in read is now blue. Its same as the matrix RED PILL, U got JESUS or life becomes a living hell until thats changed,  Blue pill you're already dead in your sins & nothing changes aka your eaten
2) If she reads light, ""the comes much worse"" they leave peacefully count they're losses then return  with a vengeance, crack the skull temple or back, the explosion highlighting that, you world shatters etc.  It all depends on if they want u gone that bad very rare, or they just wait until you fall like Olympus & turn blue.

1:12-1:13 pause,  
The caged bird that sings, I now know why, its being controlled by the entity thats trying to control u, see the stick/limb/finger of horus touching the white shoe/light/soul, tunneling through the red pants. likewise the bird is your soul, it can see u but cant touch you u need to open the cage but how  ?
1st timothy 6:16
1:21-1:25 pause  Let go of you faith, then the second touch, the pick up, notice the ufo again, now descended into a lower darker depth, no light, no clouds
1:26-1:28 shows them landing as  satellite dish on blue news vans & with tentacles/light wires falling  when the lights go dim,or the red fades depicted by the radar maps 
1:29-1:37 ""where never gonna be able to speak there words""  this is there words signs, gestures,body language, that are used @ times as modifiers for word meaning & subject and/or references mixed color codes & numbers to do the same like
""We got 3 days"" notice the blue lights above, head in the clouds, as the star spangled/tangled army controlled borg points meaning  we got/killed jesus(3 days) see the two dudes in RED, one bent over head in his rib, thats THE SPEAR & THE  CRUCIFIXION as he Jesus, (guy in middle work), see the other suit get up and walk, THE RESURRECTION, of JESUS. & thats Y they point @ u,because U got salvation.
1:29-1:32 It also means that when your light fades to blue or changes from RED, as reported by the finger the eye of horus boring your nefashot (soul)  that u got little Time, 3 days, not exactly but your crucifixion/assimilation is imminent. But only if Jesus as he walks off, as the stone behind u, not the solid rock, reads with his glove a human=mortal, not eternal. The devil wont make the same mistake twice.  As he is not willing that any should perish but that all souls be saved in hell & recruited for his final battle against the coming oppressor calling himself the king of kings, Revelation 17:14 & 19:16 
1:33-1:38 ""Figure something out"", "" I am human"" the black glove/tentacles holding the chart & the finger that touches it cool inviting exterior. the she smiles/ shows her teeth & opens her mouth to swallow @1:37 
@1:38 depicts this, as the sign on the glass outside the soul, mouth open coming full circle.
 a black/dark soul is evidently only human, without  light of god whereas RED is a Super as they call it . I call it saved & blood washed, little below the angels, SON of GOD & eternal John 1 :12-14
@1:39  its their langauge but Y ? its not different than ours by way of culture, it universal in presentation/format in any human language chosen to express it.  I conclude then it is deliberately different just to hide in plain sight this  insurrection & invasion that  was taking place, hidden in plain sight, as they in many cases mock or fragile humanity, much like they shirked they're God give duty as our helpers or big brother and instead instituted a Big Brother system & chose replace us , confuse , kill us and make us strive against GOD our loving creator.  The Superior man indeed, hidden language, layered meanings antonyms & abstract with surface level coherence for conductivity & fooling the masses, I guess GOD never saw that coming.
Lucifer u win, smart move, but then , Y did the demons  in Matthew ask JESUS ""Have you com to torment us before the time""
u see they no that they will ultimately lose so why the unneeded effort to engineer a sophisticated , albeit convoluted language to confuse the masses. to invite us to share their fate by voluntarily giving up our SALVATION & to continue to gleefully engineer our demise.  With all the horrors of their wars , the social conditioning of their media, movies , games etc.  The argument that we aren't ready for disclosure or enlightenment & evolved enough is weightless. as the world is a cold & brutal place because of their objectives, human nature is depraved & cruel but it has been encouraged by them to make the laws needed for slavery after the final smash or  future organised sacrifice & depopulation exercises masked as wars",2017-04-18T03:36:19.000Z,0

Who are they & what they want 0:02-0:05 See Amy Adams waive her hands & fingers or tentacles at the little girl in the red dress on the stuffed pony.  Thats what they want the red bike or human vessel & they are fallen stars invading the planet you skull via an stone & magic/sorcerery & modern technology,
@0:15-0:17 rapunzel lets down her hair & sees the light,, u wake up panting, here  comes the suitors, its too bright, we got to change that,"" pack you bags""
@0:18-0:21(pause) You're at the top of everyone list"", see the red 3 lights, of the helicopter under the lampshade (needle eye of horus)  forming a 6 with the tilted silhouette of the craft,  thats what they wanna give u because of the Blood of Jesus & the crucifixion, they want u to relinquish your heavenly rights
@0:21-0:25 pause ""PRIORITY 1"" is changing that, what do they want & where are they from ? see the helicopter,  from the front with only  the two white head lights on, your eyes only, no blood of Jesus covering. thats the metamorphosis they want
Also notice the pilot in green, he's a borg, linked to the stone/headset on her head.  The Paper booklet is a script/contract from what is read from her via the link/stone..,see the black dot on page above the two figures, him & her.  notice the American Flag & encircled in the yellow path. its misplaced, as in the senate house, the American was really mean to be placed vertically to show Stars as puppeteers,  thats what America is was made for, matrix matrix mind farm & warhammer
0:26-0:29  Where are they from, well America, he points on himself
@0:27 pause ""You'll be reporting to me"" yes but whois reporting, Girl in backseat behind the stone, the finger, & whats the report a REDBLOOD covered  Jesus soul saved, or alive.
That means ""We'll be be working with him"" or  Targetting him notice the point, thats a hollow point,(its not just a bullet) for a hollow cast, re casting of the person/soul/character inside of the body playing you, life a movie remember & all the worlds a stage, to them & every war fake, instigated to bring for territorial & social change, for the soul purpose moral decay.
0:28 ""when were in the show""  The best is yet to come, they haven't brought out the aliens yet, the show continues
0:29 pause ""Thats what they're calling a UFO""
0:30-0:37  The UfO, her large headphone earpeice with the two wires forming an A vertically, representative of Cleopatra two stix/canes ot what is commonly found on the tomb of pharoahs hand in V shape to neck holding them
as she dips with the mouthpiece/arm/tentacle, the sees bright light
Notice 0:32-35 The helicopter flying not towards, but back to the stone is the UFO's arm or tentacle or recoiling, illustrated by the 0:36-37 soldier (green light) UFO  running back away away from Amy adams soul because she is RED, Blood of Jesus Covered, Truth filled & Painful to touch...Truth Hurts, aka  un-inhabitable, at the moment,
0:38-0:40 PAUSE ""Who's being carted off in the medivac""  The dude behind her as she turns, notice her bag, its blue, thats his reading via the running  soldiers hand into his light, it was green, her hair/ponytail/finger revealed RED for her & as such
she is alive and cant be pulled out
0:41-0:43 ""Mot everyone is wired for what your about to do, & see her hand shakes with pain as she touches a hot, but cooling one, the dude beside her, green pants/yellow inside door, 
0:44-0:46 but when her finger ( the dude besides her) touches a cold one,  The point to the dude with knapsack, now standing  across from her, black pants, infront of yellow cylinder
0:46 pause "" so what do they look like"" see the yellow air canisters/ on backs of dudes in green suits, they look like us, human, but they are borgs, the black octopus/star on the back of head  physically clutching the yellow dim soul expunged/pineal gland/air canister behind amy addams  too bright soul for spider to crawl down the ladder is illustrated Amy Addams & the green suit behind her by green suit on the left of screen. 
Now the Green mask, to the right  just above & right behind guy in redsuit with slanted hands on extreme right of screen mirrored by the  background pickup truck & tilted air can is the easy way possession via stone fall from finger tool, tentacle when a soul is alone or unsaved
0:47-50 ""You'll see soon enough, notice the car grill, its black & the shadow on his forehead as he looks away, thats the UFO, getting closer
0:49-0:53 (Pause) ""Every 18 hours a door opens up"", see the right side of temple, just behind his eye socket
""Thats where we go in""
0:59-1:11 notice the three guys on the ground in grey , what happened to the three red lights of the helicopter in first scene, Is SALVATION gone, did she sell her soul  for a deal, the metaphorical 30 paces of silver, maybe but for whatever reason the light is gone The touch "" that just happened"", what happened now, they arrive""  notice how dim & devoid of light the passage is,",2017-04-18T03:33:05.000Z,0

The reason is really quite simple. We have been sending out waves from our radios and tvs for decades and any alien species would come into contact with our broadcasting long before they discover us. Through this they would figure out where we are and as such they would have literally decades to decipher our languages to a level that is at least workable, regardless of what means they personally communicate with. So long as they have a means to manipulate the world and travel large distances they have the ability to create a medium to communicate with us and will be capable of doing so by the time they arrive.",2017-03-06T17:49:54.000Z,0

An egg lands in the ground & then the powers that be duffle their feet to try & figure out what's going on.. only to find out that an ""alien"" üëΩ that looks like somebody threw play dough against a wall ""arrives""... uh no thanks!!! What is up with all these alien & arrival movies these days? Are they trying to tell us something? Where are the Shawshank Redemptions at? Or Fallen, the 6th sense, the game (with Micheal Douglass) frequency, seven, the devil's advocate, the prestige at? They are nowhere to be found! Just garbage movies üé• being pumped out year after year... what was the last ""decent"" movie you saw? Fir me it was a animated one called the secret life of pets... RIP little Ricky‚úåÔ∏èüòÉ No, I'm just saying the same old ""alphabet soup agencies"" coming to save the human race from ""slimmer"" is getting a bit worn out, don't u think... They are becoming repetitive & unoriginal these days. & all the great actors are getting older (Tom hanks, al pachino, Micheal Douglass, Mathew Mcconaughey, Morgan freeman, Robert dinero, Brad Pitt, johnny depp, George Clooney) & those caliber of actors are getting old... Hollywood has a problem on their hands & fir their sake they had better fix it. Movie scripts today are junk, story lines are the same, & it's becoming redundant.. if you can't see it, I am sorry that you can't differentiate between a great ""classic"" movie & this run of the mill 1 star outta 5 crap that is being put out to the public. Think about it, younger folks today, really don't know what a great, classic movie is? They think Batman is awesome, or Transformers, or these cheap ""arrival"" type's... I know I sound like an old fuddy Duddy, I'm only 35, but today's movies are not even close to what they used to be! Even horror movies are not the Same. I'm not saying release another Friday 13th, but we need a new horror character to take over this generation.. & no, scream & saw doesn't count. I just wish Hollywood would put out the QUALITY that they used to produce... There, I am done ranting, for now! üòä",2017-03-06T02:56:03.000Z,1

Aliens came to twelve locations in huge ships to tell a woman she can see the future (and history?) Something they them self seemed to be able to do, right? And by doing so she could prevent a terrible situation (preventing China and Russia from attacking them) something that would not have occurred in the first place, had the aliens just stayed away. Now you might say, well they taught us we need to cooperate and communicate. Really? As if that is what people would take from that visit (while rioting), except one Chinese general I guess. Secondly why the hell do aliens care if China and US are talking? If you ask me, it seems we have put our self in center of the universe once again, thinking superior alien races care about human diplomacy and peace on earth.  One last point, was that all it took? Think the arrivals fixed humanity's communication problems and language barrier, cultural difference and political animosity?

is not the sci fi movie for you. Arrival is ""serious"" sci fi, which is 
to say it's  cerebral and philosophical vs. action and special effects. 
 It reminded me of the Jodie Foster movie Contact, with some  
Interstellar thrown in. Contact and Interstellar were better movies in 
my view.  Arrival is as much statement on human behavior and inherent 
paranoia of individuals and governments as it is about mysterious aliens stopping by the say hello. 
 How they learn to talk to the aliens is not very convincing and the 
movie lacks any real character development and intentionally confusing 
it seemed. Think  Interstellar without anything interesting ever 
happening. What ever this movie was trying to impart on the viewer, I 
missed it. I guess ""don't sweat it"" is the message cuz time is not 
linear... Was she traveling through time? Where the aliens doing it or 
was she having visions of past and future on her own? You're left with 
far more questions than answers and the answers not very satisfying. The
 acting, visuals, and music, are first rate, and without that, would 
have been difficult to watch. B-

I am sad to say this was two thumbs down for me. The movie was too slow in my opinion with time wasted on drawn out scenes with a somber soundtrack that literally put me to sleep the last twenty minutes. I had to go see this movie a second time to fully be disappointed with the BS science or whatever premise it was going for. The whole movie stands on one weird scene that flashes around for about two minutes and is the only reason the movie mildly makes sense at the end. Is it just me or does the lead look a little like a friendlier version of Amy Schumer? I don't like Amy Schumer much myself. The movie had great visual appeal but could not overcome the poor plot and music. I give it 3/10 for the visual appeal but thats just my opinion.",2017-01-30T22:08:36.000Z,4

The weapon the aliens are referring to is the power to see the future that louise has . You have to be smart to understand this movie . Overall amazing",2017-01-20T00:20:19.000Z,0

Hollywood once again put dumbass 'smart' alien. Srsly, the idea of an advanced & intelligent Alien who can write and want to unify people with a language and decided to go to earth without knowing alphabet is just beyond me. The decoding process of the totally alien language with the speed of CSI' DNA test is too cheesy too.

Boy, I miss the time when I can enjoy movies without thinking about the plot holes.


Beside, I'm sick with this repetitive shit producers put on movies :

- Generic actors that you can expect what the movie will end up with? Check.
- Protagonist is regular citizen and is an expert at something? Check.
- Protagonist gets taken by the military with a chopper within 15 mins? Check.
- Scenes that actually mean for viewers to feel the intense of the situation, but ended up unnecessarily long? Double Check.
- Military people that act like a kid losing an argument at 9Gag? No real harm done, but still throwing a tantrum anyway? Triple Check.

The movie was very enjoyable as a food for thought kind of movie that sort of tells you to look at yourself and people as a whole and how we do things and why we do them and all that other shit. It's the kind of movie that is supposed to just leave you in a wondering mindset rather than a oh what a cool alien movie. In the end it's not even that much about the aliens than it is about what they are trying to communicate to one person over the course of the whole movie, which is really just about a single question. I won't say more else I might get into spoilers. 7/10 because it was a slight underwhelming and especially after watching the trailer again i really feel like they advertised it as more of a thriller and an action-packed movie, they basically used every cool looking danger-ish scene and the rest of the movie moves quite slow. but dont get me wrong, it's still a pretty dope movie",2017-01-17T02:20:10.000Z,0

That is why general Chang later tells her what to tell him earlier on in the film; because even though the world has already been saved Louise needed to see it in the future so she could remember it in the past. The ending killed me though... the reason her husband left her is because she knew their daughter would have cancer but chose to have a baby anyway... it really killed me, especially with that music, I almost cried in the theater :(",2017-01-04T09:11:35.000Z,1

And predicting the future? By what? By closing her damn eyes and then some cute flashbacks about her Daughter, about a Chinese man whispering to her ears and she made a phone call repeating the same words and then saved the world. The man also said that he will never forget what she said, oh my, that must be very very SUPER powerful words, but, did they reveal those words to the audience? Guess what? NO. Okay, so you are just acting a movie for yourself to enjoy, is it?If it isn't, prove me wrong please, oh wait , can you even prove anything? You can't even prove what kind of aliens they are, did not explain anything bout how she changed the future( all they had was that phone call) and did not say anything bout the father, nor the daughter, nor herself, just the language(Only shown some drawings). So, tell me, HOW is that so unexpectedly amazing that it can get 8.4? Fucking dumb movie that gets 8.4 imdb due to typical idiots who vote it high just because they think it's so mind blowing. Okay. The movie is constantly showing flashbacks that makes no sense for any plot building or story building, no, none. Not even close. Not shocked to know that who's the father. And after so long watching the movie hoping that it will finally show something that has a POINT, THEN comes the word weapon, makes the soldiers panic blabla. Erm, can I ask, why? And what's the point? You wasted my fucking time learning (or just seeing you people in the move learning) some ink language FOR SO LONG, and then suddenly a word comes up, weapon. Okay. That's sooooo good! 8.4 yay! You deserve this! Oh please for fuck sakes end your miserable and immature thoughts please. And what the hell is with the phone call thing? Yea yea one phone call saves the world and where the hell is the critical moment in the movie? Oh i forgot, it must be that so nervous and very intriguing phone call scene, which took 2 hours to reach that scene, and ends with a hug, with a guy who just confess out of the blue, without any romance building, how's that even close to being touching? No touching scene, boring plot with 80% of movie is about learning the alien's language by drawing and writing numbers on a paper and then programmed it in a computer. Wow, stop wasting money to produce such a stupid movie please, and Words can't describe how much I regret watching this ultimately fucking boring and dumbass shitty movie that I have ever seen in my whole fucking life that made me comment here to show how stupid this movie is how typical these people are to say that this movie is amazing. Please wake up, there are a lot of great movies out there and frankly, this movie is just a piece of shit. Come on, ask yourself. Would you rewatch this movie? Well, unless you wanna go through all those octopus squirting ink and whatsoever flashbacks of a child laughing and running and a fucking dumb woman who uses her mouth to breathe noisy as fuck, (she doesn't know how to breathe through a nose) and spending your precious time watching her drawing symbols on a piece of paper, okay.

Those expecting a fast paced action movie probably won't like it. This movie is more about building tension and character development. Elements of war are undertones throughout the movie, but that's not what the movie is about despite the trailer conveying that idea. Every scene is a visual masterpiece, well acted, and the soundtrack does a really good job at conveying emotion. There is a plot twist at the end that is a bit of a mind bender, but is very subtle in the sense that it really isn't explained to you. You have to pay attention to the whole film and look for clues throughout. Only complaints I have are that some characters were one-dimensional and the bits with the daughter were really cheesy. But, overall I would rate that with Ex Machina and 10 Cloverfield Lane as great recent sci-fi movies.

Although the performances were believable along with the plot, I felt that from the alternate possible scenario and end of humanity depicted in the last few clips in several trailers for the movie, duped me into watching the movie.  I totally get how her knowing the future in her mind, time was not linear in the sense of taking that future knowledge and applying it to their present dilemma to change the outcome of the present and thus alter the future (in the case of those alien vs. human conflicts in the trailers which never actually happen in the movie!!).   So, no for me, the shallow concept didn't fly.  And I was left feeling duped just like after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project"".   My philosophical entertainment isn't so easily satiated by an old cliche with a new twist and a big name Hollywood star carrying the success of the movie on her back.  Reminds me of Margot Robbie saving Suicide Squad - raising it to box of glory on her looks and her crazily awesome performance of Harley Quinn.  BTW, no one else really mattered in that film.

the main character, Amy adams, is a psychic (she has visions of future events).  those weren't flashbacks in the movie, they were flashforwards of what will happen in her life.  this whole movie takes place before her daughter was even born. so yes sadly, she has not physically been through the process of grieving her daughter's death.  she's only experienced them through visions of her future.  so yes her daughter will still die in the future üò≠.  this movie had me confused the whole time with all those frequent flashbacks.  I later figured out that they were actually her visions of the future.  when i realized this, I was pleasantly shocked!!!  haven't experienced this kind of a twisted ending since ""the sixth sense"" and ""the others"".  we need more movies like this!!!",2016-12-03T10:09:40.000Z,1

All I found was human like technology with an elevator that opens up and a square opening in an oval spaceship.....the only thing that was Ok was the loss of the gravity in the near field, but quickly dismissed in the scenes inside the spaceship when she was gathering the vocabulary and interacting with the aliens- there was no sign that there should be some loss of gravity or its shift from the normal, it was only at the entrance/transition",2016-11-27T20:07:08.000Z,4

However, I'm no linguist, but I'd imagine learning/translating a totally alien language would be next to impossible, especially in such a short span of time. Language is shaped by culture and it may not be possible to learn much of the alien language without understanding their culture and history first, especially for a written language. Even learning simple greetings would be extremely difficult since that's also entrenched in culture and history. In the movie, they taught and learned from the aliens using gestures, pictures, and movements, but I'm not sure if that's enough. At the very least it'd take years.",2016-11-13T08:00:40.000Z,24

2016-08-16T14:00:03.000Z,tFMo3UJ4B4g,Arrival Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Tonight, I have seen ""Arrival"" and it was amazing. Probably the best film of 2016 and it was more of a sci-fi thinker philosophy that it didn't carry much cliches or anything that makes it weird, but it's more of a message that any sign language that aliens were saying and what the purpose that they're coming from. Very smart film, very well done scenes, great performances, and very quiet film to look at.

To prevent a fight, a scientist will try to communicate with them peacefully first to convince them we aren't total dickwads. If the scientist fails then we won't try any other peaceful means and we'll kill these aliens certainly before they evaporate us with their ridiculously advanced technology and then we'll be saved and they won't send any reinforcements or call for backup from their homeworld(s), definitely, so a fight with aliens that flew here across the vastness of space is totally 100% viable and it doesn't really matter if it comes to that cause we got this.",2016-10-30T23:56:59.000Z,0

The spiritual meaning of number eleven is quite diverse. The number eleven is thought of as a ""master"" number in numerology because it is a double digit of the same number. When this occurs - the vibrational frequency of the prime number doubles in power. Meaning, the attributes of the Number One are doubled.

Therefore, the very basic and primary understanding of the Number One is that of new beginnings and purity. When we see this digit doubled as with the eleven - then these attributes double in strength.

This trailer gets better and better with every moment...First it's ""OMG these aliens and UFO's are unique""....Then the REAL Drama is hinted (Global Conflict) 1:55 which gave me chills.
""It's possible they're prodding us to fight among ourselves"" 
""This is just a way to force us to work together for once""
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
FINALLY...We get a SMART Alien Invasion movie. District 9 atleast dared to be different, making the Aliens almost peaceful refugees. Now we get an ADULT'S MOVIE where we can actually THINK about the plot rather than just snack on Popcorn and watch Aliens wipe out Earth.",2016-09-22T22:02:05.000Z,0

2016-08-16T14:00:03.000Z,tFMo3UJ4B4g,Arrival Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Heptapod B: Language of Gestalts""Story of Your Life"" proceeds contrapuntally, alternating between two storylines from the life of Louise Banks, a linguistics professor. Its characters are all racially unmarked. The first storyline recounts, in no particular chronological order, episodes from Louise's sometimes rocky relationship with her daughter, who we soon learn has died at age twenty-five in a rock-climbing accident. The second focuses on Louise and her partner Gary, a physicist and eventually the father of her daughter, both of whom are commissioned by the US military to learn the language of a race of aliens, which Gary calls ""heptapods"" on account of their seven limbs.

 The two cultures suffuse both storylines. In regard to Louise's daughter's choice of profession, it becomes an intergenerational agon:

...after graduation, you'll be heading for a job as a financial analyst. I won't understand what you do there, I won't even understand your fascination with money ... I would prefer it if you'd pursue something without regard for its monetary rewards, but I'll have no complaints. My own mother could never understand why I couldn't just be a high school English teacher. You'll do what makes you happy, and that'll be all I ask for. (112-3)¬†Even as Louise offers the opposite of the pragmatic emphasis that leads to Asian American occupational segregation, the juxtaposition of ""financial analyst"" to ""English teacher"" creates a contrast drawn in no small part from a post-1965 modality of the two cultures conflict.
 The second storyline engages the rigorous scientific description and extrapolation of ""hard"" SF, focusing occasionally on principles from physics, but mainly on techniques in linguistics for ""monolingual discovery,"" or the learning of a language between subjects who do not share a mediating language. The story thus thematizes the two cultures as an opposition between the ""soft"" and ""hard"" sciences. Along these lines, despite Louise's practice of scientific linguistics, she is coded as being on the other side of a cultural divide from the ""hard"" science of physics. At one point, Gary confesses to her that he had given up trying to learn Heptapod: ""I'm just no good at languages."" To which she replies, ""I suppose that's fair; I have to admit, I've given up on trying to learn the mathematics"" (124). In regard to genre, Chiang's choice of linguistics as the focus of a ""hard"" SF story is an unusual one, since the field is, both within and outside of SF circles, stereotyped as a ""soft"" science. ""Hard"" SF is concerned with ""the form of imaginative literature that uses either established or carefully extrapolated science as its backbone.""44 What makes Chiang's treatment of linguistics align with ""hard"" SF is the rigor and intricacy with which he develops Heptapod B, as well as the laws of physics he uses to analogize certain aspects of it.45 Chiang's generic revision of the ""soft"" SF of linguistics as a ""hard"" SF extrapolation is one indication of his overarching concern with achieving a formal resolution to the two cultures conflict.46 Indeed, the very title of the story‚Äî""Story of Your Life""‚Äîcasts everything that follows in this light by gesturing at the essence of the liberal arts.

 The heptapod storyline becomes a vehicle for two thought experiments. The first posits a time-symmetrical language whose users possess a ""simultaneous,"" as opposed to ""sequential,"" consciousness that perceives all points in time at once, past, present, and future: a mode of consciousness appropriate to what philosophers of science call ""block time"" or the ""block universe theory."" A version of this theory is presented by the Time Traveller in H. G. Wells's The Time Machine: ""Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it.""47 As we will see, this theory is crucial to the story's postracial aesthetics.

 The second thought experiment considers how this language might affect a sequential human consciousness vis-√†-vis the theory of linguistic relativity. Also known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, this theory speculates that ""The structure and lexicon of one's language influences how one perceives and conceptualizes the world, and they do so in a systematic way.""48 ""Story of Your Life"" thus develops one of the prevailing interests in Chiang's work, the linguistic mediation of scientific reason and reality. In ""The Evolution of Human Science,"" human scientists must decide how to interpret the impenetrable scientific research produced by super-intelligent ""metahumans,"" so they begin developing techniques of ""textual hermeneutics."" ""Seventy-Two Letters"" poses the theory that ""there [is] a lexical universe as well as a physical one, and bringing an object together with a compatible name [causes] the latent potentialities of both to be realized.""49 The narrator of ""The Truth of Fact, The Truth of Feeling"" observes, ""We don't normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.""50 As we will see below, ""Understand"" centers on the novum of a language of gestalts and is in many ways an apprentice work to ""Story of Your Life."" For Chiang, the technologization of language is often a conduit for considerations of difference: intergenerational, racial, professional, etc.51

 Upon arrival, the heptapods themselves remain in orbit, but they deploy one hundred and twelve wall-sized ""looking glasses"" to various sites on Earth to serve as two-way videoconferencing screens. Louise and Gary begin holding virtual meetings with the heptapods, who are patient and cooperative in teaching them their spoken and written languages, which Louise designates Heptapod A and B, respectively. These languages, Louise soon comes to realize, are completely separate: B is not ""glottographic"" like human writing, because it ""conveys meaning without reference to speech"" (108). Faced with the problem of how to categorize Heptapod B, Louise rejects the categories of logograms and ideograms, which appear to be obvious analogues. She disqualifies ""logogram"" because it implies a corresponding spoken word, and ""ideogram"" for the somewhat cryptic reason of ""how it had been used in the past"" (111). She settles on ""semagrams,"" since the sentences of Heptapod B operate according to their own grammar and syntax. They look ""almost like mandalas,"" she explains: the large, intricate, circular images representing the totality of the universe in Buddhist cosmology:

When a Heptapod B sentence grew fairly sizable, its visual impact was remarkable. If I wasn't trying to decipher it, the writing looked like fanciful praying mantids¬†drawn in a cursive style, all clinging to each other to form an Escheresque lattice, each slightly different in its stance. And the biggest sentences had an effect similar to that of psychedelic posters: sometimes eye-watering, sometimes hypnotic. (112)",2016-09-03T03:37:44.000Z,0

For instance, when her daughter is born Amy knows her daughter will die when they are rock climbing together when she's 25. Oh and her daughter's father is Jeremy Renner's character. They fall in love while working together on deciphering the alien language. 

The aliens leave suddenly without doing anything good or bad; they explicitly state they were just there ""to observe"". They don't give us new technology or knowledge, and what artifacts they leave behind are made of materials we already have, like silica. It was a weird short story.

If, say, their language contains much, much more information in each ""syllable"" than our languages, and if the order of their syllables affects the meaning of the surrounding 10 or 100 or 10.000 syllables, unlike our comparatively simple syntax, and this is how they are used to communicating ‚Äì then it would be a real struggle for them step down to our level. It would be like us learning to communicate with a species who only ""talks"" via pheromones or something. English (or any other human language) would be a very sub-optimal system of communication for two super-intelligent beings.

Moreover, for a super intelligent being to ""present"" itself to us, they would have to attempt to teach us their language, because that's how their thoughts are ""encoded"". Imagine trying to translate a poem into pheromones. It would take time.",2016-08-31T22:19:27.000Z,0

Which is considered a Science fiction high Art. There are no guns fired and no space wars.

The aliens come in to provide a varied perspective to the narrator of how they perceive the  world, which she does by learning their written language. I hope they stick to the novella which in my opinion is work of an art.

OR...some moron in the army or law enforcement, who for some unknown reason is trusted to stand on the front line to represent humanity, ends up shooting first because he thought the light coming from their anti-gravity propulsion system was a laser weapon.  This prompts them to leave, but not before dropping a massive bomb - The Day The Earth Stood Still style!!!",2016-08-24T20:44:06.000Z,26

america is always saving  the day, sry but this is bullshit...

despite the fact that in most of the time, america is the reason for most shit happend in the world, but anyway....

well I'm not against america, pls don't get me wrong. the country is beautiful...but you know, there are just these people...what was it again...ah yes...american. 

I don't understand american people - I'm honest, I mean what are these guys thinking right now, if they knew that there will be a new alien invasion movie in the cinema theatre, where is america saving the day again ??

I just can hope, that these guys are not thinking ""jupp...that's how it goes, we are awesome - totally agree with america, I would do exactly the same""

last time I was there, I found in a clothing store a costume of captain america and there was just one thing that was irritating.

on the label was the imprint "" this costume will give you no superpower"" - I'm not kidding

I was like ""√§hm...isn't that obvious ??""

well you know, I'm from europe and as you can see not a native speaker. 

I just want to say, in my opinion...most of the american people are just simple minded - they believe in just about anything that has to do with america. 

it is their education - sadly. 

1. why are always the black guys, who are dying first ??

2. why is always america saving the day ??

3. why are these guys always speaking of terror, when the invaded land is defending itselfs ??

there are reasons why everything is happening as it happens - there are no coincidences.

before somebody is writing ""jesus motherfucking crhist - chill out dude, it is just a movie"" 

just think about it for one second...

2016-08-16T14:00:03.000Z,tFMo3UJ4B4g,Arrival Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,THis entire movie is based on a flawed principal. An alien species able to traverse interstellar distances and with superior technology would not deal in such a difficult and clandestine fashion. They wouldn't have issues communicating or wait for humans to make every move. The aliens in this movie act retarded. Mostly though this film reinforces the American notion that 'the other' is so vastly different that communication and understanding is near impossible. Aliens with these capabilities would not need a person to hold up a white board and teach them the English alphabet. They'd just link to the net and learn it before they even set foot on the planet. We've seen this movie in different forms over and over and over. It been lame for a decade now.Ôªø,2016-08-21T18:41:57.000Z,48

""They're trying to communicate! Sometimes languages can be messy!""

Bitch! For all we know they could be masturbating on the other side!

If they wanted to communicate they would have used their space age technology to decipher at least one of our earth languages, which would probably either be Chinese or Spanish if not English, because those are some of the most common languages this planet has to offer! But that splash is just ridiculous.

The best plot twist this movie could have would literally be that they are ""trolling"" us as a species, to assert their technological dominance, otherwise it's just an Independence Day and The Day The Earth Stood Still mixup and it's going to have the cheesiest ending despite of the ""serious"" atmosphere.",2016-08-20T10:12:20.000Z,1

Cannot remember the exact wording but when they arrived they warned that if we don't learn their language we will die (They really meant that we will kill each other due to war, but people misunderstood and thought they were threatening us).
In the end she deciphers their language which is a combination of speech and movement (sort of a dance.).",2016-08-19T22:19:19.000Z,0

2016-08-16T14:00:03.000Z,tFMo3UJ4B4g,Arrival Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"So many questions here... 
1. Who or what is being carted off in the medivac at :40?
2. The openings on the ship are different. At the bottom of the ship people enter the ship through a triangular opening. At :56 at what seems to be the top of the ship the opening is square. On a certain level the crew is standing in a rectangular room that shifts their reality from standing on the floor as we would on earth, the next instant the crew is standing on the ceiling. This shifts back to the first instance as they put the birdcage down and the rest of the story continues. 
3. Gravity does not exist in the ships interior vertical space. There is gravity on level where they see the rectangular opening. 
4. At 1:20, when Amy Adams touched the rectangular panel did she expose herself to contamination. Is she morphing into something as the movie goes on? We see other instances of her shaking as the trailer continues. 
5. At 2:14, what is shaking the shelter?
6. At 2:19, are we seeing helicopters being shot at?
7. In another trailer there is a news blip that millions of people have died and eastern Asia has been cut off from civilization... Is this an end of the world movie?",2016-08-19T21:44:28.000Z,0

This is why I hate when I see space movies with humans going to different planets. No human will exist when that happens. If they do they will be accompanied with supercomputers that can transform the language for them. 

Please make something logical...

Anything intellgent enough will know wtf a gun is. 

I mean every time they make fkin movies its like they are trying to communicate with HARAMBE... please stop..

When aliens come WE ARE THE IDIOTS NOT THEM... 

Also I am sick and fkin tired of these alien movies that say they come to earth for ""resources"" SO FKIN STUPID. 

We will NEVER NEED AN EARTH 2.0 in the future. 

The problem with these movies is that they persist with humans. No human will ever do intergalactic travel. Can we please stop this?

This being the same alien race that had the time and inclination to land multiple ships on Earth and wait there for someone they didn't know existed to come and decode their language while also planting some weird subliminal messages that cause her to dream in their language.

They would want to learn anything and possibly discover new things on our planet. 
For example we have a tiny creature on Earth called a Water Bear (If you haven't already these [cute] little things are worth researching). It can survive in drastically extreme conditions and radiations. The creatures who visit us might have evolved as such, and our respiratory system and other mammal systems may be new to them and could aid in creating new medicine or other things. Likely they would never waste such resources to eradicate humans for no reason, Rather they may actually help us. Unless....
 

They could be harbingers of destruction. Traveling from planet to planet, powered and fueled by their blood lust. The extremely efficient hunters would use us as livestock as they went in search of a new planet and victim. Their vast species to large for others things to exist where it is near.

2016-08-16T14:00:03.000Z,tFMo3UJ4B4g,Arrival Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"ProTip about movies adapted from books: Always watch the movie first.

If you read the book first, you will be disappointed with the movie. You will see all the things that were left out or cut, and you will hate it for those omissions. You will notice all of the parts that were changed, and you will be blinded by anger.

And in doing so, you could be missing out on a really good film.

Going the other way - start with movie and then read the book - results in you being able to appreciate both stories. You will like the movie (assuming it was good in the first place), but you will also like all of the extra and different stuff you get from the book.

So if you have already read the book, I am sorry, you probably won't be able to enjoy the movie. But if you haven't read the book, wait to see the film first.",2016-08-16T17:31:09.000Z,0
