No bashing of anyone politically I mean, no sjw feminist and not the good kind of feminism rubbish. This is how you make a good film, and Bat woman is so far removed from this it's not funny. Wonder woman is my favorite super hero after Batman, and Gal Gadot did an amazing job. In fact she has set the bar very high for any actresses trying to enact this role. And the actress her self is very humble, motivates young women to be the best they can be in all the right ways. Does a lot of charity work and embodies much of the virtues of Diana herself. Feminism when done right is about empowerment yes of women, but in seeing the whole picture it's about the betterment of everyone. Because equality is about all people, raising one sex up at the cost of another sex. Causes more problems than it fixes, so please lets have more of this and less of Bat woman and Brie.",2019-05-23T08:41:28.000Z,3

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"Back here after watching Captain Marvel. This is really what a hero is all about. Fighting for those you love , even if they may not be worthy. Inspiring action, empowering people to have the strength to rise up, to be a better version of themselves. Giving hope to the hopeless. 


While Captain Marvel was pretty awesome, I think it wasn't able to capture the humility and compassion of a hero like it was in Wonder Woman, due to the way it was filmed (flashback sequences, wiped out memory). It really made Captain Marvel bland and uninspired. It's not fault of the character or what she stands for, it just missed the mark. Patty really did a wonderful job with Diana.

It's because what we saw in theatres is the film Patty Jenkins intended to make. She confirmed so herself and that's why there won't be an extended cut. However, this is still rather troubling as the critics reward the MCU for placing the studio's vision as higher priority than the director's. Talk about hypocritical.",2018-02-28T18:36:15.000Z,0

In ""Salt"": the woman changes the political destiny of big nations. In my opinion the independence should not appear in violence and war: the woman is just fighting alone against herself, her 'I',  against the limit of her body's power and against the stabile anti-feminism of the sociaty where she is living. The real independence should be the skillfull of leadership, should be the mental influence to the rest of the world that the WOMEN practise. The independence should begin in heads and in the way of domino effect. An independent woman can lead men fight for her, she must not stay alone while all weapons are thrown to her.

Now they're supposed to be making a Wonder Woman part 2 ain't going to say it. Like I said I was very disappointed in Wonder Woman the movie. Well maybe if they did a better story line or put more to the story line maybe then I probably would have liked it.

On the theme side, comparing this movie to other superhero movies, Wonder Woman is the first female superhero movie, which is a clear example of females' rise in status in our society. It also has an anti-war theme which is rare in the action movie genre. These political-correct themes give a whole lot of meaning beyond just the movie.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"Finally went to see Wonder Woman in the dollar theater.

Out of ALL the reviews I read since this movie came out, not one of them‚Ä¶.NOT ONE‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ever, EVER mentioned that this is a COMEDY!  A laugh riot, farcical comedy!  OMG!!!!  I haven‚Äôt seen anything this hysterical since Liar Liar and Batman and Robin!!!  

All the ‚Äúgood‚Äù reviews out there make SO much sense now!!!  The BAD acting!  The screwed up Wonder Woman storyline!  The inaccuracies GALORE!!  The laughable and incorrect ‚Äúaccents‚Äù!!!!  The FLAT CHESTED, DWARF woman playing the Amazon!  The superlative BAD, BAD casting!  

OMG!  Patty Jenkins is a COMEDIC MASTER!!!  Besides the absolute brilliance at a hobbit Wonder Woman, David Thewlis as ‚ÄúAres‚Äù was divine comedy perfection!   To cast one of the best ‚ÄúC‚Äù grade actors in Britain as a ‚Äúgod‚Äù was indescribably the most brilliant comedic move to date!  I laughed so hard, I almost pee‚Äôd my pants!!

I think the ONLY actor in the whole movie who was trying to be serious, was the woman playing ‚ÄúEtta Candy‚Äù!  She was MARVELOUS!  She put everybody else to shame!

This movie isn‚Äôt billed as a comedy, so I fully expected some actual serious stuff.  But after almost cracking a few ribs after watching this enormously hysterical comedy of errors, I can see now why so many people liked it.

SUCH a good laugh!  

But I have to say, DC has destroyed Wonder Woman for me.  And after being such a long time fan and collector, this just completely destroyed everything Wonder Woman stands for and fights for.  

But alas, even after getting such a good laugh out of this ‚Äúmovie‚Äù, I still want my dollar back!",2017-09-24T22:36:43.000Z,1

What pissed me off about the plot was this whole thing that america likes to do very often which is repainting history in a different colour. the actress gal gadot wasn't really a help to  her own people by playing in this movie, she basically sold out big time. but here is what's going on apparently according to this b/s crappy story line the german soldiers are influenced by the side of evil, therefore they didn't do anything wrong. kind of bullshit yes. so now in hindsight germans never really hated the Jewish people during the actual world war but rather were influenced. its so wishy washy and smells of american b.s.",2017-07-02T15:44:30.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"this is disgusting, here's why: (first of all let's get something straight, I'm not a woman hater (how much u wanna bet u think i was based on my first scentance) I like the movie, what I find disgusting is the reaction.)
Now, I find this disgusting  because people are crying at the fact that wonder woman is saving WW1. 
Now you cry! How much you wanna bet you fell asleep during the memorial day assembly at your school which remembers the real people who sacrificed their lives, not a made up comic book character.
Seriously, millions of soldiers died in the trenches of WW1, but you don't care. However!, now that a woman is the one who saved the day you are crying. And it's not even a cry of sorrow it's a cry of joy. If you want something to cry about, watch saving private ryan, the most realistic war movie there is.
why would you cry about a fake magical girl from a magical island who came and saved the day with her magic rope, and magical shield,  but while watching the movie, while watching the scene where she climbs out of the trench on her own with her magical shield, you don't have any thought of the 38 million that died the exact same way she climbed out of that trench.
I'm saying this about the movie because it's the only super hero movie that takes place in a war (or the only one I know of), and also, I don't think anyone has ever cried watching any other super hero film. I'm not saying all this because I hate woman, (although I do think that's the only reason why people are crying is because it's a woman super hero), trust me, I would have said the exact same thing if it were a male super hero and people are crying. But I don't think anyone would have cried if it were a male super hero.",2017-06-29T04:03:30.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"Here's some interesting perspective. Cars 3 took the box office with 53 million this weekend. Wonder Woman made another 41 million in it's third weekend. 

That's amazing by anyone's standards even for Marvel. Having only dropped 30% on average is fantastic. 

Only Star Wars Rogue one had similar week on week earnings drop around 30% or so. While i don't think Wonder Woman will quite match The Dark Knight. 

It will certainly be among the best of the genre to date. A huge accomplishment and rightfully deserved. I will be seeing it again tomorrow with my bitches. :b",2017-06-19T02:38:40.000Z,2

Seriously my aesthetic was damaged after seeing her in Wonderwoman... As for the movie it's one of the worst i've seen in the theaters... Luck of screenplay and interest... The whole movie is a worship for a beautiful woman with silly dialogues and extra scenes with no point (aka the man who sells ice-cream in the train station during the war!). I don't even want to mention the scene where they drink their beers and she is replacing the cup on every second. Not even Scorsese does these mistakes in his movies.

The last fight scene was nice though.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"When I went to see Wonder Woman with my friend, I came out of the theatre babbling about how Diana is so strong and fierce and brave, and how she made me look forward to my next run, my next gym session, so I can work even harder and make myself stronger and faster and maybe, one day, I could be like her. I'm seventeen, and all I wanted in that moment was to *be* Wonder Woman. 
When I said all this to my dad, ending with, ""from now on, I'm training like Wonder Woman"", he told me that what I was feeling was how he used to feel about superheroes when he was four. And how my brother felt about superheroes when he was six. I've been watching Iron Man Armoured Adventures and Justice League and reading Spiderman and Captain America comics with my brothers since I was old enough to understand the stories, and it's taken me until I'm seventeen to feel the same way they felt from the very start. Because as a girl growing up with Spiderman and Captain America and Iron Man and The Flash and Superman and Batman and Green Lantern, I never had what they had - a character I could identify with.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"*SPOILERS*

Not a bad film. Certainly the best of the DCEU so far (I haven't seen Suicide Squad). Here's what I would change:

1. The Beginning needs to be better. It doesn't really get interesting until after they leave the island. It felt so cliched in the beginning with lines like, ""She's a child,"" and, ""She won't be a child forever.""

2. If Steve Trevor really is British (I don't recall him indicating he was American in any way like he is in the comics) then he should have a British accent.

3. Since war is a big theme in the film, it would've been good to see her accept having to make a Sophie's Choice in war. She goes around saying, ""This is wrong,"" a little too much in the film and it gets tired. And then, when confronted with a problem, she's able to solve it (like the trench warfare).

It would've been great if she was shown to be forced to have to make such a choice and weeps as a result. She then realizes that this is the truth of war that her mother warned her about.

4. I would've preferred she defeated Ares the same way WW defeated him in the George Perez reboot. That was so much more meaningful.

5. I don't mind Ares looking the way he does in human form, but in god form, why does he still look like that British Actor?",2017-06-04T01:55:02.000Z,1
2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"Just saw the film. Question (*SPOILERS*):

Is the film version of Steve Trevor American or British?

He's American in the comics.

He has an American accent in the film but identifies himself as working for British Intelligence (under the Lasso of Truth) and reports to British officers/officials in London.

I don't recall him bringing up the US once in the film yet I see him identified as American in the media.",2017-06-04T01:46:38.000Z,0

If their were bad guys in ww1 it would be Austria hungry possibly our Russia killing their own soldiers and Jews particularly our Britain propagandist the war like crazy to get help. Britain is always the bad guys and we believe they're the good guys because they taught us how to turn your enemy into a monster.  even Belgium attacked Germany and just wound up getting their asses kicked. the only country that didn't completely instigate Germany in ww1 was France. America got joined into the war based on a lie Britain told us. China didn't fall for it. ww2 happened because Germany was still pissed off about the way allies did them.,2017-06-03T22:39:39.000Z,0

All of the embodiment of that character was in fact portrayed by Lynda. The movie is so dark and fast with phony looking backgrounds and computer generated sequences that it reminds me of the kids video games.¬† Sadly enough too, the woman in the title role can't hold a candle to the natural beauty that Lynda Carter has always had then and now. Lynda had the most innocent but beautiful face ever to grace the screen. Her costumes were made of beautiful colors and the right materials to be flattering and sexy without adding sex to the show.¬†So I will not sit through and give this movie a chance or buy into it. Instead I will continue to watch the original tv Wonder Woman on my DVD set and go back to the time when quality was much better than quantity and when lessons could be learned and super powers were used with compassion.

So what? Wonder Woman has no armpit hair. Big freaking deal. IT'S A MOVIE BASED OFF A COMIC BOOK! IT IS NOT BASED OFF A REAL PERSON! There are bigger things going on in the World. Women getting killed in so called honour killings. A Dictator is wanting to build nukes. And all you bitch about is some fictional character who has no armpit hair. THIS IS WHY NO ONE TAKES ANY OF YOU SERIOUSLY! I would recommend that you just read the comics or maybe a book but you'll just find something to bitch about there. So please just kill yourselves and stop wasting precious oxygen that we all need. Have a nice day.,2017-03-21T20:11:43.000Z,73

Also, kinda worried Chris Pine might become more of a main character rather than Wonder Woman, but I don't think that'll be the case.

The trailer may be glossy and awesome (TBH it did look good) but that is judging a book by its cover (Example given: Suicide Squad), Zack Synder may not be directing the movie but he is helping write the story. If you ask me, that's just as bad.

There are 7 different popular movies being released in one year. Three of those are NEW movies, one of those is a movie that has not appeared in 12 years, and the other three are old popular movies.

In Captain America: The First Avenger somehow it didn't bother me, probably because i am used to the Hollywood clisches in ww2 themes. But addig the evil germans vs good americans (i mean citizens of the US) into ww1 is a little bit outdated. In the original relesae of the comic it was understable that they made a propaganda to the avereage people. But in the early 21 century it is silly and laughable to portray the us as the ultimate savior of the enetet counties. Seriously at the end of the trailer i was waiting for some schwastika, or something. There is a big secret to you: there weren't any good or evil sides in ww1, just selfish, greedy politicans, economic lobbies, ignorant militar leaders on both sides.",2017-03-06T07:41:56.000Z,0

We have only gotten vague information on the movie so far and the trailers have been awesome getting us excited and they look great but they also do not tell much. I've heard about the theory that Ares will be the main villain which fits the comics and the potential payoff could actually make this movie amazing. Especially since Ares is a god who becomes more powerful when men fight, which could tie so well with Diana who had begun to lose hope in humanity. But that is where the writing will make or break the movie. Everything looks great so this is a movie that I want so badly to work. Just please DC, get this movie right or I really may lose all hope in your franchise.",2017-02-08T18:12:05.000Z,0

You see people thinking the new Jurassic film, Independance day 2, Suicide Squad, BvS and many more are going to be good even though you can obviously tell from the trailer if it's going to be at least decent or bad.

This movie is going to end at 60% on RT, not good but also not bad. It's probably going to have good effects, some decent action scenes and soundtrack, but ultimately it's going to be a very mediocre action film that's forgotten 3 months after it comes out.",2017-02-03T18:54:54.000Z,0

She tanked a nuke with Superman partially covering her in the books.  She's the Goddess of War.  She carries a sword and shield forged by the greatest weapons maker in Greek pantheon  Hephaestus, blacksmith to the gods.

Wonder Woman could pretty much destroy the Avengers by herself with the exception of Thor.  She is the Goddess of War, he is the God of Thunder. War wins over Thunder no?  If Thor had happened to call in a sick day when that fight happened - she'd destroy all of them.  She's a combat master.  She'd go for Hulks head and end him quickly.

It's not dark and gritty (old DC) but neither it is heavily fun and adventure (Marvel). It's hopeful and optimistic first and gritty and fun second, something I haven't felt since the Dark Knight Trilogy. Honestly, when I see a Marvel film, it reminds me of the fun and adventure of Indiana Jones. I'm actually kind of glad that Joss Whedon did not took the helm of Wonder Woman or the DCEU.
Hopefully this film will be great and WB learned there lesson from Suicide Squad.",2016-11-24T06:23:58.000Z,20

$50 says this will fail harder than Ghost Busters, end the career of Gal Gadog? (look at that! I'm already forgetting her name) and collapse the film industry forever - because when Warner Brothers invoke a coitus interruptus on making films, because the salaries of actors is more than $1 billion per film, we are all doomed.

The only thing that can save this film is digitally removing Gal Forgone and replacing her wooden and stilted performance with someone like Mega Fox. yes, you heard me right. This film can be saved by putting Mega Fox in the lead role.

Those words will never be uttered by me ever again. Ever.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"This film does look good the action, visuals and even some of the acting, but I am skeptical because it's based during World War 1. I'm worried how they are portraying Germans and if they are going to portray them as villains just because they had weapons that caused such devastation. Not saying that one country or even an individual was responsible for why the war happened, it's debatable who started the war, but the way I see it is that some individuals in the war were just as bad as each other. In World War 1 there was no heroes or villains, just a pointless bloody war that only gave rise to a bigger, longer and ferocious war.",2016-11-13T13:59:39.000Z,11

Almost every Zach Snyder film is awful, whether he's directing, producing, or writing the film. Snyder is the Michael Bay of superhero movies. They both overuse special effects, too. Bay overuses explosions, while Snyder overuses slow-motion.

There is no such existential evil in the the WWI era. The whole international-capitalist system was responsible for the slaughter. If one had to choose the worst of the combatants, The Tsar's government was the most corrupt and repressive, followed by Wilson administration in the US. Yet she seems to be fighting on the side of the Allies. What would make more sense would be if the Amazons felt they had to conquer all of the warring powers and replace their governments with truly democratic regimes that would not fight each other.

1) I really don't want some super-duper advanced ""alien technology"" or whatever that requires 800 billion layers of cgi. Just some boots on the ground, sword and shield combat would be the best thing to do.
2) I was originally thinking that it was going to be entirely set in WW1, but if this is going to be a flashback movie [which it looks like the direction they're going in], I want as much time as possible in WW1. Which I honestly doubt will be a huge problem.

Wonder Woman said that she used to want to save the world and from what I can see she was trying to save the world during the World War 1 era but I am guessing that something horrible happened during that time which demoralized her will. Steve Trevor most likely ended up dying either from old age or due to the War itself, and maybe after witnessing the destruction and death caused by the second world war Diana believed that no matter how much good she did humans would end up killing themselves into extinction and decided to keep out of world affairs until the Kryptonian invasion.",2016-11-08T20:23:29.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"Did she really need a character arc based around reflecting a bullet? She has so many different backstories to choose from or draw inspiration from, but instead of leaving the island to see the glory that is the world and going from fry cook to (honorary) ambassador as she sees the best and worst of humanity, all while holding onto the ideals represented by the gifts bestowed upon her, we get invaders with guns as a 'call to adventure'. Sure, okay.

I'm entirely for a dark and dramatic storyline, but levity and pacing is needed for such stories lest you end up with Liefeld-esque narratives. In other words, all drama is depressing, but drama mixed with comedy or exciting action (requiring achievements and an overall sense of victory) is gripping and even more dramatic. To put it in another frame, if you are watching a fight, it's more gripping and heartbreaking when they both fight well then one loses/dies than it is when one guy mercilessly pounds someone much weaker.

I will say that the music in the trailer was amazing.",2016-11-07T05:06:26.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"I want this movie to be a hit because , One , Gal Gadot is amazing in the role of Princess Diana/ Diana Prince /Wonder Woman  and for me the reason I said she is amazing is because her take on Diana made me forget Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman while watching BVS and these trailers, her acting has been trashed by some but if you really take the time to watch it, you can see she is one amazing face actor and does does a Really good job talking acting IMO.  

Two , Both trailers for Wonder Woman  IMO show Patty Jenkins has really made a great Movie as long as the script is as good as the visual effects and attitude and no one can say this movie is too dark from the trailers. 

What I find funny is people want superhero movies to be masterpieces like gone with the wind . Take these movies for what they are, movies to watch your fav hero kick butt, not make you go home in awe and amazement 

BVS was no Masterpiece , the mathra part was pretty stupid but it's not gone with the wind.  Marvel is only better in they seem to avoid small dumb details like the martha but I got where that was going, they just rushed the movie and should had work the martha scene out better but for me that was the only part that was stupid, yes Wonder Woman could had killed doomsday by cutting his head off with her sword but forever reason, Superman had to die so it has to be that way and marvel movies are guilty of the same plot holes for ending a movie as above but critics seem to ignore that but I get it, one mistake vs too many mistakes. Well, I have a feeling that Wonder Woman will be more marvel friendly for critics

oh and let's stop making dire predictions of a movie on if it will fail before it has even been seen yet",2016-11-06T11:57:53.000Z,89

Suicide Squad was the last of his fruits. Wonder Woman is completely free from him and Justice League has him as advisory director who will be 100% gone by Justice League 2, with only a temporary return for Man of Steel as a writer; not director. His stink is over with, give the new DC phase a chance, it's literally being controlled by Geoff Johns now, the same person who made DC comics so great. Geoff is effectively a young, DC version of Stan Lee, it would be like Stan Lee controlling Marvel films.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"Some bits I've managed to spot and some observations:

Steve is being interrogated with the lasso of truth on him (can just barely be seen in the lower right corner of the screen).

The sword the guy is wielding near the end appears to be Diana's own sword, so she was likely disarmed at some point before that scene, and was now in the process of reacquiring it.  Certainly she has to have been on the short end of the stick at some point in the movie for proper audience anxiety and a situation to dig herself out of (78 Supes had the kryptonite necklace around his neck), and the sword being in the villains' possession hints at that.

99% certain she is not flying at the end, but has just reached the apogee of a huge jump and then the lightening may from that point contribute in suspending her

She's charging past/thru quite a bit of rapidly erupting/collapsing material before the big jump so perhaps the crossed bracers are in the process of trying to absorb the brunt of some massive energy outburst from below

Would love to see a scene in Justice League where she and the Flash are competing at bullet time reactions - he'd readily win but she would be seen to  be at a not-insignificant speed, and anyone else in the room would appear to be frozen",2016-11-06T04:29:29.000Z,0

Lots of grandiose landscape panning shots overlaid with a slightly eerie soundtrack whilst the main character and those close to them mutter attempts at 'deep' lines.

Although this one also has the added handicap of a lead actor who can't act.

Another thing, the movie looks alright. The best thing I like about it is that D.C. is doing it different from Marvel in the sense that they're not releasing each movie on its own. Based on how the title of the movie was shown, the movies are presented like chapters of a larger book; possibly that of the justice league. D.C. may have finally found they're way.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"""On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.
These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn‚Äôt handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced ‚Äúmissing‚Äù from the Pentagon‚Äôs coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.
Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI‚Äôs lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.
The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover up from start to finish. It was based on testimony extracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney‚Ä¶well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn‚Äôt bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of ‚Äúlittle practical significance‚Äú. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims‚Äô family members‚Äô questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were ‚Äúa failure of imagination‚Äù because ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ‚Äù except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.""",2016-11-05T06:14:58.000Z,1

So. Heroic? Check. Epic tone, and intense, and dramatic and cinematic without being overly dark or over-the-top campy/grim/depressing/hollywood cheesy action movie fest. It's serious yet also has that heroic, emotional punch that makes it intense. 

This looks like an actual 'superhero' film in the most intense literal sense. 

So tell me, if they could do this for Wonder Woman, why didn't they just axe Snyder and do this for Superman? The character who literally DEFINES the entire tone they're going for with the WW trailer (hence why WW And Superman make for good Justice League counterparts)?",2016-11-05T05:45:17.000Z,0

Could we be getting a Bruce Wayne cameo at the end where it's revealed that she's telling him her origin? Also, could they stop playing Wonder Woman's theme at the end of each trailer. I like the theme, but it sounds so out of place with the rest of the music in the trailer. Other than that, pretty good trailer.",2016-11-05T04:23:08.000Z,2

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"Why is everyone get angry about what she's wearing or lack there of? Honestly. She was raised in a strong female culture where you weren't judged for those sorts of things. She was taught confidence. Why are we judging her for that? Applaud confidence. Why is she not wearing full body armor? Because SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO. The tools she uses in battle is exactly what she needs. It's a good thing that she doesn't need full body armor. No, the movie doesn't go exactly with the comics, but if you know a movie that completely lines up with the book, please let me know. YOU CAN'T EXPECT EVERY MOVIE TO BE PERFECT. Don't you dare criticize this movie solely by the 2 minute trailer and the appearance of the actress. Wonder Woman is willing to sacrifice everything she knows in order to save everyone else's butts. ""Oh no, she's no Wonder Woman. She doesn't have blue eyes. Her accent is weird. She's not wearing enough clothes."" Or maybe, ""She's hot. I wanna hook up with her. Her legs are sexy."" There are comments on this video alone worse than that. Judging a woman or anyone else based on appearances is disgusting. She is a strong woman who loves everyone equally and also saved the entire world. Please accept the fact that yes she is a female superhero. NUFF SAID.",2016-11-05T03:22:20.000Z,1

To me as someone who read Greg Rucka Wonder Woman comics, it just seems unlike her to turn her back on the world. In those comics she never abandoned them no matter how bad the world was to her even when the Amazons were blamed for murderers and she blinded herself...
  Well at least not until Allen Heinberg's reboot, so I guess the movie is going with his version sadly, hopefully she'll still be similar to how Ruckalikes her. I just wish Gail Gadot had more Charisma. In this trailer, her lines sounded flat to me

I'm done with the Extended universe. I'm not going to watch Justice League Part 1, nor anything coming after it, if Wonder Woman sucks. I'm sick and tired of Zack Snyder banking on the cinematic universe reputation that Marvel garnered, but there is a reason why Marvel made it successful... They made actually universally accepted and good movies. Movies that know exactly what it wants to be, and not trying to be something it's not. After Man of Steel, Batman V Superman aka Pot vs Kettle, and Suicide Squad... I would really like an actually good movie out of DC for once. I don't go see DC, expecting it to be just like another Marvel movie. I go to see DC, to see DC films like The Dark Knight, or even the Christopher Reeves Superman Films. Back when DC did know how to make a good movie, and Marvel didn't have the Cinematic Universe to go on. So, if it turns out to be yet another polarizing movie with most people hating it, and since there will be feminists possibly defending it, people who actually like it and try to tell us you have to watch it multiple times to understand. If that's the case, then it really doesn't make sense. And how much do you want to bet that there's going to be an extended version that's only slightly better and the obligatory R rated cut? Cause Zack Snyder doesn't believe in the R rated theatrical release... Despite Deadpool being a huge success with it's R rating.",2016-11-04T19:45:14.000Z,0

Y'all are making it seem as if though yall are jealous that Warner Brothers and the dceu are finally getting it together. Jealous that this movie is going to work wonders at the box office. Jealous that this movie looks fucking insane. We aren't pulling a Captain America. If so show me where. This is set in WW1. WW1. DO YALL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WW1 AND WW2. SHE IS A DEMI GOD WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE A FUCKING SHIELD. HOW IS HER HAVING A SHIELD RELATE TO THE FACT THAT SHE'S COPYING CAP. YALL ARE JUST SOME CHEWED UP PIECE OF GUM STUCK ON A SHOE GETTING DRAGGED THROUGH SHIT AFTER WATCHING THIS TRAILER AND STILL MAKING A RETARTED ASS EXCUSE ON WHY IT SUCKS. I've gone to see if the same hate resonates on any other Marvel trailer and guess what? I don't see any DC fanboys calling your films shit without having seeing them. So please do us all a favor Marvel fanboys. FUCK OFF. I bet most of yall are probably 13. PATHETIC.,2016-11-04T17:24:00.000Z,1

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"U.S. imperialism launched the Korean War in order to deprive the Korean people of independence, permanently partition the country and occupy South Korea. This war was part of U.S. imperialism's post-World War II strategy to suppress communism and the movements for national liberation and to extend its own colonial empire to the four ends of the earth. To this day, the U.S. maintains its occupation of Korea just as it remains, on a world scale, the center of counter-revolution and main obstacle to the peoples' struggles for national liberation, progress and emancipation.

The struggle of the Korean people against U.S. occupation and for the reunification of their country ‚Äì a struggle which the people have persisted in for more than 60 years ‚Äì is an inseparable part of humanity's struggle for progress and peace. The struggle of the Korean people deserves the support of people everywhere.",2016-11-04T15:50:46.000Z,0

There were even thoughts that the brutality and savagery of the Great War would be so shocking that nobody would even want for war anymore.... and then WW2 happened.

1) It is still DC and their films have been horrid outside of Nolan's
B) No Zac Snyder is a major improvement
3rd) Gal Gadot does not look the part and her acting is going to be a big misfire
IV) Music is outstanding
Last) I'm already getting a sense from this trailer as to what has plagued other DC films, and that is a total focus on visuals with zero character development. Hopefully, DC has figured out how to make a decent film and maybe will flesh out their characters for once.",2016-11-04T12:38:24.000Z,0

If they really wanted to amp up the box office sales, they would get with the current trend of the return to the 70's-80's ultra-high on the hip, ala BayWatch, and watch sales soar through the roof.  Add in a few more Wonder Women from her planet wearing the same and it will become the summer blockbuster.  It's not rocket science.",2016-11-04T11:40:32.000Z,0

Well, it was never gritty in the first place...considering a film about villains was a PG-13 comedy, and BVS was just based mainly at night time, and MoS was just about a moody 30 yr old. If that's gritty, I'm laughing. Go watch Dredd if you want a comic book film that's both epic and gritty and dark. 

Anyways...hoping this is the turning point for DC, because if this is mediocre at best, or awful, like the previous 3 DCEU films, I doubt they have a huge future...",2016-11-04T09:37:25.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"everybody keeps saying this is similar to First Avenger...the only similarity is the fact that there's a war...and it's not even the same war...First Avenger is more of an underdog story. He WANTS to join the fight, goes from Zero to Hero, loses close friend, never gives up hope etc etc and his villain is essentially his opposite. 

WW is a citizen of ""kick your ass"" island and is completely unaware of the war, the only reason I'm guessing she wants to go is because it looks like they killed one of the other Amazon's (looks like she's not used to death for some reason) 

even had they decided to go the route of using ww2 here I still think there would be enough to differentiate the stories greatly; they're really different character driven narratives. 

also I feel like given the trailers introductory little blurb from her, that following the war she's gonna lose faith in humanity and possibly also be unable to return to her home island either.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"I think with this movie DC has a chance of coming back into a good position. Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman and Suicide sqaud all suffered from having the DC universe's story arc rushed through. I mean its like Man of Steel (SPOILERS) you have an origin to superman and then the very next movie BAM Superman dies. Where Marvel has been much better because they took nearly ten years to build up origins for all the major players before we have things like Avemgers and Civil war. With Wonder Woman it looks like they are trying to add meat to the rather skimpy bones of the DC cinematic universe and that can only be a good thing.",2016-11-04T07:50:59.000Z,0

DC knows better giving Wonder Woman her solo at their 4th movie unlike Marvel which couldn't even give a proper character to Black Widow and even no movie as Captain Marvel is still 2019.....,2016-11-04T06:31:04.000Z,5

My hope with Dc is long gone but it seems this one would actually be lifting my hopes. Though due to hype, I expected much more from this. But for me this seems better than BvS and SS. I hope crtics don't ruin this. But seriously DC needs to step up with this.  And also, eye color doesn't really matter, Gal is doing good job.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],I really do hope this lives up to the potential. DC as a whole if it lived up to it's potential would be beating Marvel right now and that isn't being said as a fanboy but an overall comic book fan. Warner Bros just take your time with this universe because patience will 1) create better movies narratively and 2) give the proper respect that these characters deserve. Marvel might be pulling all their stops now but it was built on years of sowing the seeds needed to accomplish a story of this scale. DC has plenty of epic stories to be told but for the layperson they will mean nothing if they aren't built up to have any meaning.,2016-11-04T04:35:43.000Z,1

The latest example is the exit of Flash Movie's director, Rick and this is the second time this has happened to that movie which is already I pre production and has already castes side supporting roles so what about those newly cast actors? Do you think about that? I bet not but we all are in a hurry to bash Zach when it is not his fault to begin with.

We must re elect the board of WB so they give the directors freedom of choice to do the film in their own way rather than buttfucking them.

Next time you complain, read the newspaper that focuses exclusively on film production.

Yeah, the camera following a bullet can look cool, but it's been done to death (The Matrix was almost 18 years ago). Surely the technology exists to make a great action movie look as natural as possible (allowing, of course, for the context of the narrative). Sigh!",2016-11-04T03:47:03.000Z,0

They really need to work on the green screen and cgi though but hey, this is just the second trailer. They'll sharpen things up soon. This was just to appease the fans.

Shailendra Daniels,

On 8/30/2016 lied on husband to the cops to steal their child to keep the child from the father Fabian. Shailendra went to the local magistrate and deceitfully lied without any proof to the magistrate James A. Ortte to have Fabian taken to get a mental exam, so she could steal the child while Fabian was taken away by police. Fabian was released 1 hour later after talking with therapist and was told sorry by the police, things like this happen!

Shailendra Daniels will not allow Fabian to know where the child is and Fabian has not seen the child that he cared for as a stay at home dad for 66 days as of 11-3-2016. And stole 100k from the family and tried to leave Fabian with ZERO so Fabian had no means to fight in court. Shailendra Daniels is the lowest type of devil from hell.

Fabian is working closely with the police to file charges for perjury in Manassas, Va on Shailendra Daniels

That comic relief lady is not funny, and I fear she will take this film down a few notches.
The film seems to be a little more colorful than Batman V Superman, and the action seems...fine, about the same level. 
I am impressed by no one's performances yet.
When I think of how this movie will end, it'll Probably end with a villain with computer effects making a doomsday device that shoots a blue laser in the sky.
Though I am happy to actually see them fight people, and not a faceless army of cyborg aliens with blue blood.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"after Batman V Superman and suicide squad this movie might help DC recover at the movies. and honestly right now if DC had to pick a superhero at DC right now to be the flagship character for their movies from what we've seen of them so far, it's Wonder Woman who's the strongest pick of the three main heroes. from what we've seen she seems to have kept more of the traits that make her a hero in the translation from comic to screen. Superman didn't, the character lost his optimism and hope. Batman didn't, he's lost his code and vulnerability. She'd also beat out Thor when it comes to the mythological superheroes, Thor's are marvel's weakest movies. it'd be a good step foreword and a smart move to Put Wonder Woman at the head of their cinematic universe.",2016-11-04T01:37:51.000Z,0

Also why is she not disabled? I mean really, it's 2016 people, and non people, we should be representing all abilities. Warner Bros is ablelist and that is utterly problematic.

This is satire. I am mocking Far-Left SJW rhetoric - playing on that fact that they are never pleased with anything, even if it helps their agenda. (This particular movie, it seem clear, will be all about 'Girl power' and other such nonsense, yet this certainly will not please the SJWs enough, which thoroughly explains why that group can not be taken seriously.)",2016-11-04T01:12:21.000Z,0

To my knowledge, there where many powers at play lurking in the background, not only the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, the archduke of Austria-Hungary. His death at the hands of Gavrilo Princip ‚Äì a Serbian nationalist with ties to the secretive military group known as the Black Hand ‚Äì propelled the major European military powers towards war.

If I said this once, I've said it more times than I care to count, Lynda Carter IS Wonder Woman & Wonder Woman IS Lynda Carter. Seeing this clip doesn't do her justice. No one can fill her boots, period, end of story. This reminds me of when they tried to have Coy & Vance fill the General Lee while Bo & Luke left the Dukes Of Hazard back in the day. Granted, that was the small screen, but you get the picture. Sometimes its better off to just leave well enough alone & that was one of em much like this is another. I can also remember when they had Burt Reynolds trying too play Boss Hogg on the Dukes, Willie Nelson as Uncle Jesse, & that skank Jessica Simpson as Daisy. Are you serious? And it bombed. You CAN'T replace legends of TV like the late Sorrell Booke aka Boss Hogg, the late Denver Pyle aka Uncle Jesse, & thank God she's still with us Catherine Bach aka Daisy Duke. And the SAME can be said with Lynda Carter. Not taking anything away from the woman in this clip, but its like I said, Lynda Carter IS Wonder Woman & Wonder Woman IS Lynda Carter. It BEGINS & it ENDS right there. Bottom line, end of story. Like I said, sometimes its better off to just leave well enough alone. Maybe someday, those Hollyweird Jackass's dressed in suites will get that. But I won't hold my breath on that either, the dumb Jackass's.",2016-11-04T00:20:57.000Z,0

There is no film in the DCEU that has stronger protagonists than Marvel's cast. It's just fact. Don't go wild on another franchise because the cinematography in this trailer is stunning-- which it is --because DC has found ways to make colossal shits out of their last films, who knows where this is going. Hopefully we see some improvements with this character given that she is the last of the Big Three to get movie treatment, and hopefully she can be done some justice.

Until the film is out, don't flock to the comment section to tell everyone how it's already better than Dr. Strange or Civil War, even. It's not right, you haven't even seen the final product, but neither have I.",2016-11-04T00:11:07.000Z,0

'oh hopefully this will be better then the previous instalments' 
'last hope before I quit dc'
lol you all need to shut the fuck up. I agree recent previous DC films have been bad. But all the studio cares about is MONEY, they made enough from bvs and SS (don't give me that 'they needed billion to break even', no they didn't all you 'fans' just hyped it beyond existence.)
but yea, all they care about is money, all you fanboys, and haters are still going to see the movie. Probably love it or dislike it, doesn't matter. you contributed, another dc instalment is happening. thanks",2016-11-03T22:41:16.000Z,42

What I love about the trailer is that it isn't pushing feminism with dumb lines like ""What makes you think I can't protect myself? Is it because I'm a woman?"" Right from the start, the soldier Chris Pine plays knows she's a badass and knows she can protect herself well enough in a fight. There is a level of understanding and respect between them regarding what the two of them can do and cannot do. One huge reason why I hated the tv show Supergirl is that they pushed feminism so hard that it was actually a huge turn off for me...and I'm a woman!",2016-11-03T22:39:13.000Z,0

I didn't like her much in batman v superman, but there wasn't much about that movie to like. She is a beautiful woman but I can't buy her as Wonder Woman. After Lynda Carter it's almost impossible to recreate that image of her character and with Lucy Lawless as Xena, I just can't buy this lady as the Great warrior she is portraying. But, I always give the movie a fair chance when I see it. I am really hoping this is gonna be new epic beginning for Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. But even some of the fx in this look a little cartoonish. The filming looks great, acting and scope look amazing, so am still holding out for a nice surprise.

In the end, all those jokes only cover the flaws of the movie, and win over fans and critics because the movies end up fun. 

I want to see some dark and gritty drama with amazing action accompanied by great acting, script, and directing. 

So long as all these jokes that we are getting in the trailers so far only happen during calm and relaxing scenes, and not during serious conversations or battles. It just takes me out of the moment. The trailer is great, but its flaw is balancing this levity with seriousness.
And why does every trailer now have to end withe witty one liner or a joke? Like set the tone for the movie and keep it.",2016-11-03T20:27:14.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"I have to say, I went into this trailer very abrasive. BVS and the first WW trailer didn't impress me, and I hadn't had my fill of seeing Gal on screen for me to be fully behind her casting. In fact, the whole DCEU as a whole has left a bad taste in my mouth (including the JL trailer).

Now, THIS TRAILER is the first where I was *squealing like an 11 year old girl seeing a dick for the first time.* XD. Seriously though, I couldn't contain my excitement when I saw the first shot of Diana on the cliff's edge seeing Steve Trevor's plane go down, I mean THE COLORS! And hearing WW proclaim her morals and beliefs about defending humankind, OH! Music to my ears! If that wasn't enough, the fanatic in me went BANANAS when I saw her blocking bullets with her bracelets,  MY GOD THE GLORY!!!

Now that I'm on this high from watching the trailer for what may be the first DCEU movie to finally do its characters justice, oh man, say it with me now:

I love Marvel and have never been as excited for DC but Harley and Wonder Woman have been my favorites for a long time. I personally think this movie is late coming because girls are sitting in the audience and they deserve a role model that is intelligent and kind and kicks butt. Can we all just talk about the good aspects of this movie rather than breaking everything down negatively? For those who talk about it positively, thank you, and those who criticize it, that's your opinion, and this is mine. Have a fantastic day!",2016-11-03T19:20:10.000Z,1

SQWAD was an all american action no brainer w a surprising amount of heart

WonderWoman will give us chills &make it cool to root for strong powerful women again


The only foot DC has or could ever step wrong is heeding the bitter seeds of doubt spread by lesser smaller insignificant malcontents &negativity spreading parasites

DCEU is only three films deep &the competition is so SCARED shitless desperate &delusional they will do &say ANYTHING to knock this fresh unique non conformist movement off balance

stay the course my friends.. believe.

I have no fucking idea who the main villain is yet, so thaaaank you for giving us just enough without telling us the whole movie like BVS trailers did with Doomsday!!!... So now, I see Doctor Poison for sure now but she is just a human, so who is WW grabbing with her lasso and smashing him/her to the ground full force like that??? She couldn¬¥t been fighting a human, so wtf??? And then... we see that bullet getting passed her and possibly killing that other amazon, why didn¬¥t she stop it if she is stopping bullets at other points of the trailer???? Then we see her riding a horse at some point, so at that moment she couldn¬¥t leap or fly cause why would she need a horse, but then I am almost 100% positive she was FLYING at the end of the trailer, it didn¬¥t look like a leap, so, maybe she CAN fly and that¬¥s how she got there in time to save Batman in BVS and we just didn¬¥t see it yet???... could we maybe get to see how the Gods grant her new abilities throughout the movie???

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"I know this has been said before, but screw it I'll say it myself:

I consider myself a fan of both Marvel and DC. However, I've found that Warner Bros' attempts to cash in on the success of the MCU have led to three complete messes of films due to bad writing and inconsistent editing, despite the admittedly decent cinematography and acting (most of the time). By and large, I think Marvel has been making superior movies for the past eight years with their own peaks and nadirs, but still more enjoyable to watch than the DC Extended Universe.

Batman v. Superman is a dead horse beaten to a bloody pulp already, but the fact remains that it still suffered from a dumb plot that utterly failed to capture the meaning behind the Bats/Supes fight in The Dark Knight Returns in any capacity, shoddy editing (especially in the theatrical cut, though the Ultimate Edition fixed this to an extent), weak performances by everyone who wasn't named Ben Affleck, Jeremy Irons or Gal Gadot, and a tacked on climax with Doomsday that was used FAR too early in the franchise for the Death of Superman storyline to have any kind of weight to it.

Suicide Squad, meanwhile, suffered from a plot with more holes in it than an everyday M. Night Shyamalan film, imbalanced characterization for the main characters (anyone who wasn't Deadshot, Rick Flagg, Harley Quinn, or Amanda Waller was almost completely sidelined), constant focus on probably THE worst Joker performance I've ever seen in any DC media, and the simple fact that it served no purpose than to give us that one scene at the very end where Bruce gets the files for Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash from Waller, which probably could have happened in a mid-credits scene in BvS if they wanted to. Oh wait, they don't do mid-credits scenes, because that would make them too similar to Marvel, AND WE CAN'T HAVE THAT NOW CAN WE!

However, this trailer has me legitimately hyped. Gadot was one of the best parts about BvS (despite her abysmal total screen time), and this trailer got me excited for her chance in the spotlight as Wonder Woman. It also seems like the writers might actually know how to treat this character, so I'm excited for that.

Overall, good trailer. Now WB, please don't screw this up again, or else I'm never going to bother with your DC movies ever again.",2016-11-03T18:36:07.000Z,0

I'm not sure how much this has to do with Gal Gadot playing the part (fell in love with her in Fast Five). But Superman has always been a boring superhero to me.... someone who's pretty much all-powerful and whose only weakness is a fictional glowing rock. And Batman is EVERYONE's favorite and has had more than 8 feature length films in my lifetime, so I'm kinda tired of him. I just love Wonder Woman's style of fighting and the way she kicks ass. I've also been a sucker for Greek Mythology since I was a little kid, so that adds even more to it. Plus, it's great to finally see a female superhero in a lead role of one of these blockbuster films. I'm hoping this movie will be sick as hell.",2016-11-03T18:32:01.000Z,210

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],Now Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice was a total train wreck... No offense to all train wrecks! And Justice League looks like an awkward mess from all i've seen of it. But this movie actually looks pretty darn compitent! And i'm actually hyped for this film. Looks interesting and fun. Wich in the end is what you want from this kind of film. So let's hope the trailers are an accurate representation of what we are getting. Because atleast we'll have something to prais the DCEU. Man of Steel in my opinion is the best Superman movie we have ever gotten. It's pretty good. Suicide Squad is also pretty darn good in my opinion. Atleast it was fun trough and trough. So far only shit with Batman in it has seemed poor... With Batman as a central character that is. Hmmm... It's odd since i like the new Batman.

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"The war was terrible, but the Germans were not the ultimate evil the entente made her in history.
While the next quote has it's fair share of propaganda, it's pointing out Germany's outlook of the war, which was silenced in the victory of the entente in 1918 and the treaty of Versailles: 
In order to appreciate what Germany has accomplished during two years of war, one must to recall to mind the great"" expectations which her enemies attached to this war, into which their powerful coalition for years of political scheming and thorough military preparations had enmeshed the prosperous empire at the outset, the avowed purpose of Germany's enemies  was to annihilate her,  her army, her fleet, commerce and her industry. France, hoped to regain Alsace-Lorrien, Russia hoped to conquer the provinces of east and west Prussia and Posen which were likely to recieve the ""Blessings of Russian Culture"" Austria-Hungary was to be dismembered, the Balkans States were to be rendered Tributary to the Czar, Constantinople and the Dardanelles were to be added to the Romanov's dominions. As for England, she deliberately entered this war because she thought she would run small risk. The world will remember the vain glorious way in which Germany's enemies foretold that before long their armies will meet at the Heart of Germany, where Cossacks were parading the streets in Berlin and Indian Lancers and Gurkhas would stroll through the parks of Potsdam, Germany would soon be Paralyzed, nay, would soon be passing away. Such were the expectations of the enemies attacking us from all sides, Germany was drawn into a war of self-defense. And today, how to Matters stand? Excepting one small corner of the empire, the only enemies on German soil are vast numbers of prisoners of war, the War is fought on enemy soil Germany and hr allies occupy 3 independent kingdoms, they hold vast areas of enemy territory, in east and west, they hold these territories firmly, without fear of losing them by force of arms. Consider the efforts our enemies made on the western front in their unsuccessful attempts at lusee and Chapmainge last autumn: suffered terrible losses and made no headway. In the spring, Germany took up the offensive against Verdun, step by step, we steadily gaining ground. The french positions are crumbling away one by one. Thanks to the genius of Hindenburg, east Germany is no longer threatened by Russians, Last year, with cooperation with our valiant ally, Austria Hungary, we drove back the Russians overwhelming their armies, for two months it is true that the Russians resumed offensive but have not succeeded in breaking through our lines. Our enemies obtain nothing but terrible losses, they achieve little but substantial gain, in no material way damaged our positions on the western front. Our enemies will probably realize in time that they are biting on Granite.... The allies have been rejoicing over the collapse of Germany, repeatedly it has been postponed Germany enters it's third year of war with unaltered confidence in in her final triumph, Germany is fighting against the greatest odds in history, she is not only fighting against the most powerful combination of enemies, but, with the world of prejudice skillful created against her.""

Considering the times we live in and how society is evolving, it couldn't be a better time for something like this. Gal Gadot is absolutely gorgeous and Patty Jenkins is a smart choice as the director.¬† 

This is DC's big chance to gain the upper hand in at least one segment and to be honest - the trailer doesn't look that good. It comes off like a female version of Thor combined with Captain America: The First Avenger. 

It just lacks a distinctive atmosphere and face, but maybe that's just me.

Anyway, I hope the movie delivers.¬†DC and WB¬†can't really¬†afford to fuck this up. If they do, DCU will positively remain and be remembered as the ""also-ran"" of this current generation of comic-book movies. Not¬†because Marvel's movies are lighter, or more family-friendly, but¬†simply because they're¬†better and because Marvel actually delivers what it sets out to deliver..",2016-11-03T17:52:54.000Z,3

This one scene makes me think why she didn't stop that bullet when obviously being fast enough to keep her eyes on it?
I know the whole scene is just eyecandy for the strong picture (with that bullet in the middle of them hitting the swinging archer). But if it becomes too illogical it can destroy immersion completely for me.
Please cut that right and don't make her head and eyes turn, for example. Far less slo mo there, please. Just a quick and dirty shot should be more ""shocking"".
Or if she's actually fast enough make her try to do sth. at least. Not just ""staring"". Looks kinda weird.",2016-11-03T17:50:14.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"""Oh man! Did you see the Batman vs Superman trailer? Supes looking all super and shit. Batman glaring at his Batsuit and Jeremy Irons  being all like ""you're consumed with rage"" and shit. It's going to be AWESOME!"" --- every DC fan 3 years ago. 

What I'm REALLY wanting to see is WB realizing that  letting the suits edit these films into slapdash theatrical cuts compacted to fit more screenings, ISN'T a good idea. It's seriously damaged the brand. 

How do you fuck up Superman and Batman first forging their legendary bond on the big screen, a bond upon which much of comic culture is BUILT in the shadow of? How do you fuck that up? With a weak script weakened even further with horrendous corporate editing and story direction that is driven by pie-chart graphs the studio put together.

Suicide Squad could have been the superhero genre's Silence of the Lambs but they played it safe and made the child murderers and domestic terrorists lovable rogues with hearts of gold when they should have been portrayed as pure evil scum who only a psycho in a Batsuit could bring down. 

I want WW to destroy the global box office. She's a trinity member. She deserves the best as it's the characters first big screen outing. I just know there was lots of cool shit in those B v S and SS trailers too. The unfairly bashed Man of Steel remains the best DCEU film.",2016-11-03T17:41:54.000Z,1

I'm not only a marvel fan or only a DC fan, I like both, but it's hard to enjoy DC movies when they aren't very good. BvS was garbage, never enjoyed the man of steel movies, the batman movies were amazing, and now there's suicide squad which I actually liked a fair bit, if not for the silliness of poor editing skills to make everything fit together better (More Jared Leto.)",2016-11-03T17:34:00.000Z,0

could it be that the Ghostbusters thing was simply because it was a shitty film and wasnt about sexism at all... well not from the fans anyway, the movies makers on the other hand.

but I digress, if the Feminist community really wanted a film to rally behind, to inspire both young girls and boys alike here it is.

Don't screw up your directors and never cut down the movie length. I supported you during Snyder because let's face it, he's dumb as an onion. I kinda supported you during Suicide squad because you gave me more deadshot in trade to more Joker, I mean , come on, deadshot was awesome! Will Smith killed it as deadshot. Also Margot Robbie, my crush. Anyway, Patty Jenkins is great and thank God, she left Thor movies. Please don't do injustice to Patty. Don't betray wonderwoman cuz she's bisexual. Do justice and a good justice league movie. Don't do injustice. The only injustice you are allowed to do is a movie with the same title. Who's up for crisis.?

Oh, well, I'm sure it will do just fine at the box office. Also, no offense mean, but her waist ought to be larger than her neck. Some of the publicity stills are kinda scary looking.",2016-11-03T16:50:46.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"This looks VERY good so far, but it's hard not to feel wary after the DCEU's past output. I was cautious about Batman v Superman from the start (which was proven entirely warranted once I saw that baffling disaster), but I was genuinely excited about Suicide Squad, only to find it a frustrating, sloppy and surprisingly dull mess. And to be clear I'm not going in wanting to hate on these movies- I LOVE these characters, I LOVE the DC Universe, and I desperately WANT to like these movies, but so far they just haven't managed to get it together. I've been wanting to see a Wonder Woman movie for ages now, and I'm willing to let myself get excited for this one in spite of those recent disappointments. But for me at least this is their last chance to get me on board- if they blow it again on this one, this absolute can't-miss project that has so much going for it, I'm calling it quits on the DCEU entirely.",2016-11-03T16:44:03.000Z,0

But is possible see that this trailer (and the first one) is way too different (and better) than was the Batman v Superman and Suicide Shit ones... The trailer really show us a lot of imporant things that will be on the movie, and looks like they are more focused in do an ACTION movie than mix a lot of things and possible ruin everything (like on Suicide Squad).

My faith is on that movie, i'm more hyped for it (not too much, of course, 'cause of the past experiences) than for the Justice League Part One movie.",2016-11-03T16:30:03.000Z,0

2016-11-03T16:00:54.000Z,1Q8fG0TtVAY,WONDER WOMAN - Official Trailer [HD],"Amazing. WB learned from their Doomsday trailer. Seeing it for the second time, we see Diana's sense of duty, the warrior, the compassion she feels for the world and at the start, the pain of walking away from it all. Etta Candy is funny, Steve will undoubtedly provide humour and some of the action. We see enough of Diana to know what she's like. We know Danny Huston's German officer is going to be an antagonist but we don't know WHO he is, nor what he plans to achieve, David Thewlis is still absent which means they are probably saving him for the movie. At this point Danny is either Ares/Steppenwolf and David is Zeus/Steppenwolf. 

We see brighter scenes with more colour, great action and what may be the new tone of the DCEU. This is the movie to make or break the DCEU and I cannot wait to see the final trailer and then the movie itself. June 2017 cannot come sooner.",2016-11-03T16:29:00.000Z,1
