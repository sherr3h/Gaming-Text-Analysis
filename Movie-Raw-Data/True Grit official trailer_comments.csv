That to say is, the Music is very important here, as in all Cohen films. They should stick to the filmmusicperson(forgot his name) they've got, he's GOOD!!!!

Look upon one of the best Westerns Ever: ""High noon""! Where would it be without the Music of Dimitrji Tiomkin!!!!!!!

Ah ain't got nothin' against JW, but making comparisons here gets plain immature!

2010-10-06T17:22:58.000Z,CUiCu-zuAgM,&#39;True Grit&#39; Trailer HD, i think it was a good interpretation of the film and it was different enough from the original to keep it interesting. it was also a little more for adults - the original was rated G and reminded me of the sound of music or something. it was a quality remake. it doesn't matter if the story is true - it is fiction. i think the subject matter is far more interesting than a bunch of rich kids and their exclusive harvard email addresses. john wayne's pistol will be up their ass in hell. ,2011-01-15T00:54:42.000Z,0

It was an okey movie overall if you buy it, i think the money would be well spent, but it¬¥s not a ""big hit"", it just gets a rental, a 7 out of 10. I could not predict the ending at all, it was really diffrent from the movies content itself. i enjyoed it but some parts just got boring, but as i said be4 it is an OKEY movie and it is worth seeing. I love other movies that makes you feel serentiy after you watch it like Avatar,The Town,public enemies etc. thumbs this up",2011-01-14T23:52:56.000Z,0

i agree the original scene was better with john wayne - rifle in one hand and pistol in the other. the filming and camera angle of that scene made it seem a little more epic in the original. 

i think the girl and john wayne were a little more persuasive in the original but matt damon definitely did a better job as the ranger. ",2011-01-14T19:50:41.000Z,0

2010-10-06T17:22:58.000Z,CUiCu-zuAgM,&#39;True Grit&#39; Trailer HD,I'm glad Hollywood is again making westerns (even if they are remakes).  Not as good as the original (of course) but worth watching especially if you have never seen The Duke in this role.  Weird speech tone and patterns so it felt a little forced.  The Girl did a GREAT job and deserves at least an Oscar nomination.  She is a wonderful actress.,2011-01-05T22:11:05.000Z,0

Yes I know it's VERY difficult to improve on an original.  I'm still glad to see Hollywood making a few westerns.  This one was just weird due to the way every actor seemed to speak their lines (i.e. voice tone and speech pattern).  Maybe it was just me though.,2011-01-05T22:08:15.000Z,0

so many scenes included, scenes which added nothing, and some real stupid action too.

Im sure hes great in this movie. But I have a problem with remakes for classic movies. Leave well enough alone. (not 4 all movies) ex- Titanic. And maybe a few more.  John Wayne got best actor award.
