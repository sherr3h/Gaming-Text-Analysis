2015-11-03T17:31:37.000Z,WQkHA3fHk_0,ANOMALISA - Trailer (2015) - Paramount Pictures,"SPOILER ALERT:
In my opinion, the meaning of this spectacular and very meaningful film, Anomalisa, is that the main protagonist, Michael, does not know true love. Everybody he speaks to (even women and children) has the same young male American voice and face, this is because he can't see their uniqueness in them and doesn't treat them like he would treat himself, he treats them in a rather hostile or negative way. He even acts this way to his wife and son, who both love him very much. But when he finds Lisa, she has a unique voice and he's drawn to her. They fall in love because Micheal realises the uniqueness in Lisa and is amazed and touched. However, Micheal starts to nitpick at anything she does that he doesn't like. He acts very controlling and manipulative towards her. He criticises the smallest details, for example, the way she taps her fork onto her bowl when she's eating. He almost takes the uniqueness out of her, almost making her another face in crowd, another person with that young male American voice. He decides to leave and go back home to his wife and son, truly alone as he still doesn't see the uniqueness out of them, and, in a way, doesn't love them....",2019-04-23T15:47:19.000Z,0

What is it to be alive?

Some bad

Each has a body 
Each body has aches 
Look for what is special about each individual 
Focus on that
