""In the transition from book to movie, many aspects get left on the cutting-room floor. Even so, these omissions proved particularly egregious, partially because they involved rewriting history.""

I'm getting sick and tired of this new and improved PC Hollywood. 

Now movies are saturated and infested with this ""race"" ""gender"" and ""diversity"" shit from the fascist left that has taken over our whole society. 

Read FrontPage Magazine's articles and Gatestone Institute for the truth you won't hear from the lamestream media. 

Just going back and forth with a couple of leftists. One of whom hyped this Cuban ""workers paradise"" bullshit. 

I simply referred him to Humberto Fontova for a reality check. ""Che"" and Fidel were sadistic mass murderers and torturers. This idiot after my suggestion read a single article about that ""Che"" movie they put out. Total, unadulterated, BullShit. Pure Propaganda. 

""Che"" wasn't a ""freedom fighter"". He wasn't an ""intellectual genius"". He wasn't anything the left or media said he was. He was the worst kind of murdering terrorist scumbag.

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"This movie seems like it will be heavily focused on the female cast members, which is fine so long as they make it enjoyable for everyone and not pull something like the new ghostbusters movie. With such a high budget and needing to make.. I think it was 210 million dollars in ticket sales, they need to make it enjoyable for everyone and not have it heavily relying on the support of a single demographic.. Though I have not read the book and cannot say if the book is like that, I just think that they need to atleast attempt to make this a movie for everyone and not heavily focused on a single race/gender/movement.. Like with ghostbusters for example.. They really only made that movie for feminists and then were shocked when people who are not a part of that movement didn't like it and gave it bad reviews. 

(for clarification when I say ""they"" I do not solely mean Disney. I mean the respective production company's. I think Columbia pictures was behind the new ghostbusters movie but don't quote me on that)",2018-03-11T20:30:18.000Z,0

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"The kids are supposed to be awkward and geeky, but they're way too uncharismatic in here. No wonder critics panned the film - they were sick of seeing the kids, who are a bit painful to look at. And all the white critics are uncomfortable with the black casting - though they won't admit it. That's part of being a Disingenuous White Liberal or libtard - which all film critics are. I've come not to trust critic reviews.

I bet L'Engle would've disapproved of the casting of Storm Reid for Meg. L'Engle may have been a YA fantasy writer, but she seemed to have lived in a very white world. Unspecified race means white in America, especially back then. The casting of Reid is odd - she looks mixed, but she's not the Rihanna-looking mixed that whites and others like so much - that's considered so attractive and cool. If Reid grew up and had some plastic surgery, then maybe she'd be more in line with what Euro-centric critics want to see. I doubt the film is as bad as critics say it is - they just don't like the characters, especially the casting of Reid.",2018-03-11T18:41:44.000Z,1

I am hoping within this year to see more movies that honor and respect this line of thinking because its a great line of thought.

I'll reserve judgement until I see it...but it does look as if they've changed a lot of the things in it that made it such a great read that I got it out of the library 4 times that first year!

I remember after we read the books and I saw the original movie, it wasn't very good... the movie was clearly on a low budget as the effects were awful, the acting was awful and overall the movie was awful. But so far from what I've seen from this trailer... it looks fantastic! The visuals are stunning, the acting seems half decent, and it looks like the movie is following the story pretty well!

No joke this was my absolute favorite book as a kid and recently did a senior art project on the book. Basically made concept art and character designs for what an animated film of it might look like. Seeing this trailer during Coco felt like a dream come true so much that I legit cried tears of joy. For me the celebrity casting or diverse ethnicities I could give less of a fuck about (I don't know if they ever said what color the characters were besides from the front covers so I'm fine with it). What's important is how well they actually stick to the original story, character personalities, and settings. Don't understand why they changed Ms.Whatsit's centaur form though. Guess it's to bring out the fantasy aspect or avoid children from seeing a half-naked hot dude. Will withhold major judgment till I see the movie for myself.",2017-12-18T02:59:10.000Z,0

I was a bit worried because she mostly does social dramas (which, to be fair, A Wrinkle In Time is by way of allegory, it was made in the 1950s and is very anti-conformity, pro-diversity, and anti-sexism in an era where everyone had to be the same or they were the enemy) but she appears to have adapted well. I hope the movie does well, it meant a lot to me as a kid to have a female scientist hero who couldn't conform but was a hero anyway, and I want other kids to have that too.",2017-08-18T09:33:13.000Z,0

  NO! Go preach your modern activism on some stupid video or book that promotes it. If you'd have read the book, you'd know that the casting sucks.
  Meg should be primarily unattractive with her glasses on. Also she should have MOUSE brown hair.
  They screwed up Calvin again, he should have freckles and orange hair.
  There is too much CGI, and in the other trailer they quoted ""the only thing faster than light is darkness."" 
  Stupid quote, BS, and there's so many better quotes that are actually IN THE BOOK!

I see Reese Witherspoon and I believe Mindy Kaling are in it.

Very little was shown about Charles Wallace or Calvin, you know.. Meg's co-stars? The book was more about finding Meg's father, not a fight between light an dark.

I'm re-reading the book so some of this is a little rusty on me, but they DEFINITELY nailed the scene with the houses and kids. Creepiest thing there was and actually seeing it, even for a second, sent a shiver down my spine. A tad bit excited, but this is probably gonna flop.

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"Some people (generally minorities) want to keep race in the discussion because racism affects their lives day in day out. Some other people (generally white) don't want to hear about it because they don't directly experience the pain of racism, so they don't feel it's a problem they caused or can resolve. In any case, pretty much everything in the USA is about race and it will continue to be until systemic racism in our society is addressed in a meaningful way.
Also, anyone saying that it matters what race these characters are needs to get real. Damn near every character in Game of Thrones was changed in various ways from the books, but people still love the show. Why? Because race, ethnicity, physical features, etc don't make a character, unless those traits are a central theme in the story. Typically, in my opinion, it's the acting makes a character believable, so if you're suggesting that white people are somehow being cheated or diminished by not being portrayed in this movie, just get real. Yes, it's true that there is FINALLY an effort in Hollywood to diversify film rolls and that is a good thing, given how lily white the best roles have been until recently (with some notable exceptions). Point is, if you're white and are crying because film roles are getting more ethnically diverse, well, too bad. Your privilege needs checked. There is room in the film industry for far more diversity and if your delicate sensibilities can't handle that, it's your problem. People of color go to movies too and they deserve to see more of themselves reflected on screen, in some of the top roles. If you have a problem with this, you may be biased in your preferences and may not have the self awareness to realize it. If this is you, don't make your problem everyone else's problem. Instead, just fix your problem.",2017-07-23T04:37:33.000Z,0

How dare they not stick to the book and cast someone with braces? Lmfao, while I was obviously being sarcastic, truthfully, that is exactly how all the racists sound on this comment section.  Meg's physical characteristics are described as her with unruly mousy hair, glasses and braces.  But PLEASE, someone tell me which page is it on where Meg is described as a white girl?  I'd love to know.  The only thing that could remotely establish Meg's character as white is her last name being Murry (an Irish last name), but then the casting is spot on with hiring a bi-racial actress since Chris Pine (a white man) is playing the dad -- problem solved!

Besides that, if you're seriously not watching the movie because there's too many Black people or you feel it's not ""sticking"" to the book.  Don't see it.  It's very simple.  But I can tell you one thing ... I'm pretty sure there will be a LOT of movies in the future you will not be seeing.  This will NOT be the last movie with POC (People of Color) casted based on a book.  America is a melting pot and as much as the racists would like for Us to ""go away,"" unfortunately, we're not.

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"I read the book in 1963 when it first was published. It was the Newbery  (spelling is correct) Award winner for Children's novels. It introduced the concept of time and space transcendence in an interesting format, along with the notion of individual exceptionalism. Race is irrelevant - the theme is love and faith penetrating through the smothering of conformity. Meg is every early teen wondering if they are special and if their life has meaning.

That's the story. Now the bad news: Disney has their hands on it. They have a stellar track record of taking the most beloved of stories and re-writing them to a point the original author could hardly recognize and certainly would not own. John Carter (aka A Princess of Mars) is an abomination I'll never get over. They wrecked it so badly that the two BEST books in the series, The Gods of Mars and The Warlord of Mars, cannot be screencast.

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,I don't even recognize half of these scenes from the book. Maybe it's the style they went with or maybe it's been too long since I read the book. And I'm not trying to be racist or anything but why do all these new movies make characters a different race than they should be. This includes making black roles white but recently it seems more movies are making white roles black. I just don't see the point and it's quite a disconnect from the people who read this book when they were kids and now have a movie where the protagonist is now black. It just seems a little strange to me.,2017-07-18T16:42:36.000Z,0

Also Calvin's family being super Irish is sort of important in later books (and since every studio is franchise crazy these days, I assume they'd like to make sequels) So yeah. Where my gingers at?

Also Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who, and Mrs. Which don't look ANYTHING like they do in the books, and I'm not talking about the fact that two of them  are black.

The only one that can save the one's you love, is You. And you will be put to the test, so it won't be easy. Well sounds a bit familiar lol.Isn't that what we're dealing with today? God said that ""we fight not against flesh and blood, but against wickedness in high places"" Now God truly wins in the end but you will be tested during the fight. The children in this movie represent us (children of God) and the spiritual torment we often experience, even when we don't know what it is. if we don't give up on the fight against good vs evil & our relationships with God, not only will God win..But you will win WITH HIM. just thought i'd make the connection lol but yea..#GodBless",2017-07-18T07:08:07.000Z,1

I have not seen any movie adaptation before, but I can also tell you that I'm glad that Disney is doing something that is, more or less, have not been adapted by them before, or adapted before by any company. Even though there was an adaptation made when I saw a trailer for it on the Spy Kids VHS, I have not seen it. Most, if not, almost all of Disney's slate for 2018 does not classify itself as a remake of one of their old animated films, and we're getting 3 of those in 2019. Mary Poppins Returns is a sequel I'm looking forward to. This movie has a more original flair than just being a remake, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms, while dealing with the Nutcracker ballet, has not been dealt with extensively before by Disney other than in Fantasia, Wreck it Ralph 2, Ralph Breaks the Internet is an animated sequel to an animated film and not a remake of an animated film, and Magic Camp is essentially an original comedy. I guess my worry is Disney not making interesting movies anymore because I saw the Nostalgia Critic's video of ""When Should Remakes Not Happen"", and he argued that Disney's live action remake of Beauty and the Beast did so much of the exact same thing that's been done better in an animated cartoon made 26 years ago, and that doing the exact same thing is a good reason not to do a remake. He also argues that the new Planet of the Apes trilogy qualifies as good remakes because it takes a familiar story in a different direction. Simply put, I don't want to quit being a Disney fan even if Disney no longer makes interesting movies.",2017-07-18T01:17:55.000Z,0

Honestly the three witches could be any race since in the book (spoilers) 

They are non gender specific celestial beings. They just take the form of women.

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"I have to admit that this particular trailer doesn't make the movie look very good. The dialog is very general so that you don't know what the movie is about. ""A darkness spreading"" isn't very exciting or original. 

And yeah, the girl from the book had like, red hair. It was actually an important setup for the plot. And also, yeah, the book is almost more about the brother, Charles Wallace, than about Meg (who though is important, isn't nearly as interesting as Charles). This is why the sequel, 'A Swiftly Tilting Planet', has Charles as the central protagonist, not Meg.

Look, I hope the movie is good, but this trailer isn't. I hope that people  who hate diversity won't be able to point to the diversity in this as to why the movie fails, but honestly, the casting choices here for these characters seem really, really off.

This reminds me of 'The Golden Compass' failure. 'A Wrinkle in Time' is actually a dark book, but Disney doesn't do dark. Not like this book, anyway",2017-07-17T06:49:04.000Z,0

Peopletend to like the movie to be accurate to the book. The idea that the main character was a nerdy science geek with dull brown hair and a pale complexion was fairly important to the book considering her mother was beautiful and it was the core of her insecurities the book focused on. Making her this beautiful black girl with perfect skin and amazing hair seems to undermine the plot of the book. Plus, if people were to have, say, a white jasmine, everyone would absolutely freak out. To hard core wrinkle in time fans, that's what it feels like.

I've never read the book and I understand wanting to keep the characters the same as the were in the book but it's not like Disney specifically said they wanted a black actress to portray this character. They had auditions and she happened to portray the character the best. If my favorite book series was being made into a movie, I'd rather have a good actor that may or may not look exactly like the character than a crappy actor that looks exactly like the character. And once again, I highly doubt the girl's race was important to the plot line so why does it matter?

That would have interested and compelled me far more than this stylish crap.",2017-07-16T21:28:29.000Z,0

Countless times, Hollywood has tried to recreate books into film and many times has failed and REALLY the only movies to ever capture a book(s) to the tee are the Lord of the Ring movies and Harry Potter. This movie is MOST LIKELY to be inaccurate, although who knows no one has seen it yet it could be accurate, but it has amazing visuals based on the trailer and even if it is inaccurate it could still be a great movie!",2017-07-16T10:15:23.000Z,0

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"I thought the Murrys lived in Connecticut.  And I thought Meg was an awkward, reluctant hero, rather than an eager ""warrior"" and the ""only one who can stop the darkness.""  And I thought the Mrs. W's looked like eccentric old women in their human forms, not beautiful, alien queens (I was about to add ""no offense,"" but I guess it's not offensive to say ""sorry ladies, you're too young and pretty for these roles""...)
Just based on the trailer, this adaptation seems to have taken quite a turn from the tone and themes of the source material.  I just hope the trailer was so badly spliced that it doesn't capture the whole movie, and I turn out to be wrong.  Some stories truly are best told in a single format, and so far, A Wrinkle In Time has proved to be best told in book form.",2017-07-16T07:25:45.000Z,85

oh, add onto the fact that this is a Disney Sci-Fi film and those never do well (I ca only really think of one exception) since sci-fi fans will never be caught dead watching anything from a company that makes ""kiddy films"" unless they are made by Lucas Films or Marvel, and Disney fans themselves have never been that receptive to Sci-Fi films, especially this film because doing a straight up adaption would be literally impossible without literally turning it into a David Lynch wet dream, and deep down inside ""fans"" of the original book know this you can deny it all you want and blame Disney or black people but you know full well that is what would happen.",2017-07-16T05:19:39.000Z,1

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"Why? Why why why why why?

Why Oprah making Mrs Which into something she's not? She's supposed to look like a stereotypical witch--when you can see her at all--not a washed up talk show host in a fright wig. Why isn't Mrs Whatsit bundled in her stolen clothes? What the hell happened to Mrs Who?

Why race-change? Why does everything have to get a fucking race change? Meg is described. Charles Wallace is described. 

And the stupid race change is NOT going to get black people to come and see the movie. The entire series is as whitey mcwhiterson as it can get--you can't just slap on some black skin and make it 'diverse'.

There are actual stories with actual black protagonists, why not make one of those if you want a movie with a black protagonist--we'd all actually like that instead of this endless shoehorning of fake diversity into stories that don't need it. 

God damn it, Disney--you're making Black Panther---why can't we finally get African fantasy stories? Anansi tales? Stories with REAL black people in them--instead of this endless parade of white characters in blackface--because make no mistake--that's what this actually is. Hollywood is AFRAID of making fantasy or science fiction stories about REAL black people so they keep attaching them to random properties in the hope that one will take. Make Magic Street--make Anansi Boys--Make Podkayne of Mars and really screw with peoples minds.

Or take a really huge step forwards and make a fantasy or science fiction movie with a real black protagonist that was written by a real black person!",2017-07-16T02:52:58.000Z,18

the story is a common complaint seen in response to movie trailers. So, I‚Äôm
glad, never having read the book, that things this trailer tells us are: Chris
Pine is involved in something like travelling near light speed (in the same realm
of possibility that Disney could remake 2001: A Space Odyssey), that Oprah‚Äôs
character is someone who can appreciate what Chris Pine‚Äôs character is involved
in and herself is knowledgeable about it, apparently a mentor archetype, that
Pine‚Äôs character‚Äôs daughter looks set up as the lead who must stop a faceless
darkness, which must be Chris Pine‚Äôs fault, a borderline family friendly/general
appeal affair, followed by a multitude of fantastic clips, which hopefully are
not even the coolest shit that will happen in this movie (but I‚Äôm trying to

Also, while I'm all for racial equality and all that, did they have to racebend characters that were specifically stated in the books to be gingers? Forced diversity just never sits well with me.

Also I really, really hope they don't try to water down the message of the books this time; that bothered me to no end with the 2004 movie.",2017-07-15T23:11:49.000Z,0

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"You have *GOT* to be kidding me. In the books, Charles Wallace is described to have *blond hair,* and *blue eyes.* This Charles Wallace does not match the description at all. 
Neither does Mrs. Whatsit. I mean- sure- she's a fucking centaur thing when she's in her true form, but usually, she appears as an old lady who got her clothes at a garage sale. I don't mean that to be rude, but its true. In the books she is described to have a very mismatched exterior. Underneath all that she is described as everyone's favorite grandma. That may have not been said word for word in the books, but its close enough. I can't quite tell exactly who each Mrs. is, but at 0:58 I'll guess that Mrs. Whatsit is the middle one. She does not fucking look like a sweet old grandma. Albeit she does look regal, but that's not how Mrs. Whatsit was really described, out of her usual form. 

Next, Mrs. Which. Now, I don't mind her design. She is the least material of the three in the books, but the most powerful. She is also the most distant from human reality, in the book, completely forgetting that human require 3 dimensions to live, and attempts to land them on a 2D planet. Her voice is represented through lots of douuble lletttterrrs, suggesting that her voice is like an echo. I can't truly find anything wrong with Mrs. Which, *YET.*

Now, Mrs. Who. She is the most unclear out of all of them. Partly because half of her words are not her own, she quotes writers and such. Her one major characteristic is her glasses, which can be viewed in the trailer. So really, nothing wrong with that. 

I mainly envisioned the Mrs's as a bunch elderly women. I'm unused to seeing them as young women. I will be seeming when it comes out, but I will have extreme doubts. In all, this seems like a major flop.",2017-07-15T22:54:16.000Z,1

2017-07-15T18:02:19.000Z,E4U3TeY2wtM,A Wrinkle In Time Official US Teaser Trailer,"Children, please, you have been brainwashed. If you call those who point out that none of the main characters were black in the novel, that's not being racist. It's about hypocrisy. Can you imagine if Disney used a novel written by a black author instead, and hired a white director who made some of the characters white? And for what reason? The director says she wanted Meg to look like one of the brown girls from her own childhood. True colorblindness is if your ethnicity is irrelevant. But she was very specific¬†about ethnicity and knew what she wanted.¬†Now, if Meg was black and a white director said he wanted her to look like one of the blonde girls from his childhood, people would go ballistic. One also gets the impression¬†the director is using the movie to promote some of her personal views. Yes, the trailer looks good, but it doesn't change the facts.",2017-07-15T21:08:49.000Z,0

Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, the Harry Potter movies, Hunger Games saga... there might be a handful of others but most attempts fail. Few can keep making blockbusters for the decade or so that it takes to finish a large saga. There are four books in this one. Six if you count the in between ones. The Gunslinger already lost my attention as the trailer looks like someone threw the first two books, a collection of the comics and an old Steven Seagal flick into a blender and hit pur√©e. Idris Elba, Matthew McConaughey... what a wasted opportunity for these two great actors. This looks rushed and so I fear that it will fail at transitioning the original source into film.
