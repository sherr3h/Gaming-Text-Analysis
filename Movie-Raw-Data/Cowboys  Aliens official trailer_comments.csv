I'm actually glad I got convinced to watch this movie, cause there's a 95% chance I'd pass on it on the very sight of the title. But the plot, the acting, the effects, the story, literally everything in it is more than decent. It combines perfectly the classy cowboy theme with something of a whimsical B-class movie dart toss of a writing decision. It proves you that you can even make ""mermaids vs vampires"" movie and it would deserve cinema screening ... If you execute it right.",2015-09-12T18:03:56.000Z,121

Bad points: the soundeffects and background music (it's from like the 50's). The acting was pretty bad in some characters too but the two main were really good. In terms of screenwriting and plot = many problems too. Ending not the best. The combat between the humans and aliens was terrible and gay. Premise of the movie was original. The aliens were alright (e.g. design). Verdict: 7/10. It was ""O.K.""",2012-05-18T15:26:54.000Z,0

1. The aliens are keeping them alive to experiment on them to find out their weaknesses, obviously they have to keep alot of live becasuse the cant experiment on everyone in one go.

2. The humans blew up part of the alien command tower with sticks of dynamite (the opening where the ships fly out from).

1. Why the aliens keep their prisoners alive and kill them
2. Why in the end the aliens dont fight with their aircraft . In that case they would be easilyfor them to  win

The storyline and plot is so simple a three year old could easily follow it .   The characters are all like paper thin cardboard cutouts,  there isn't anything to it.

Cons:
1. Terribly generic font for the opening credits
2. Olivia Wilde is introduced awkwardly, with a wierd 3 and 1/2 frame shot.
3. Olivia Wilde is actually an alien/firespirit thingie...not sure if it works or not.

Pros:
1. Harrison Ford is a BAMF
2. I like that Daniel Craig punches things when he's thinking/confused
3. Daniel Craig's behind looks great. (No homo)

yea i know its a movie, fiction. But that shouldn't mean the author doesn't have to give it a little thought. Besides, even in the realm of fiction, the story has to make sense within that world of fiction. It seems like today a lot of movies rely on graphics and effects rather than well structured and captivating storylines. This just sounds dumb, I am sorry.
