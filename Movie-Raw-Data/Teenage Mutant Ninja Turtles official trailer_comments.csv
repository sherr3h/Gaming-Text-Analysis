2014-06-24T15:56:39.000Z,OdgNSJiWJTo,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Official Trailer #2 (2014) - Whoopi Goldberg, Megan Fox Movie HD","I think you should stop complaining about Michael Bay ruining Transformers and Ninja Turtles, I'm not defending his movies, but here it is:

 - There are still some recent Transformers and Ninja Turtles cartoons that most people that watched, liked, even the long-time fans, go check Transformers Prime and Nickelodeon's TMNT cartoon. 

- Most of these live-action movies based on cartoons, anime, toys and video games suck anyway, and many of these franchises stayed strong after these failures and reverted to their roots.

- As I heard, The Ninja Turtles live-action movies from the 1990s aren't that good either, people love them today because of nostalgia, the first one is mixed, the second one is hated, the third one is considered one of the worst movies ever.

- The Ninja Turtles franchise was really whored in the 90s, go search for all the nonsensical licensed products they had back then, the live-action series, and the rock concert, if it wasn't ruining back then, why it's ruining only now?

 - The classic Ninja Turtles and Transformers versions you liked won't stop existing because of the new versions, Michael Bay is not sending people to your homes to destroy all the copies you have of these classic shows.

- Michael Bay is just a producer in this one, not a director,

- Your childhood is a lie, I'm not saying these shows were bad, they were cool for their time, but Ninja Turtles started as an indie comic book that was violent, dark, gritty and bloody, and was a parody of comics like these, the original cartoon that everyone loves, was made just to sell the toys, so they needed to make it childish, goofy, hip and full of slang, and tone down the violence, doesn't this sounds like ruining? Also the Transformers cartoon was created to sell the toys, and to this day Transformers is all this, check out the page ""To sell toys"" in the Transformers Wiki to see how the plot of all Transformers is written to sell as many toys as possible, all of you are overprotecting two long toy commercials.

Now, a counter argument I can agree, is that the main Transformers media became the movies, people know the Transformers more because of the movies than the cartoons, but it's ok, same goes with Marvel and DC superheroes that are more known  by movies and shows than with the comics.",2015-07-16T15:24:15.000Z,1

It filled me with lots of euphoria (not the kind from LSD) and got me really excited. If you are a passionate TMNT fan, this movie should satisfy you. It conjures up that TMNT nostalgia and has plenty of action. Initially, I detested such a movie because ""Michael Bay"", but this is one of his best movies so far. Some of the things I didn't like include the aesthetics of the turtles; it didn't really bother me but a few improvements would have been better. There is some drama but it is fairly low-key in terms of length. Also, if there was a deeper, more intricate plot, that would have helped a lot. It doesn't entirely follow the backstory of the original TMNT series but it still features some classic elements and killer action! I'm 21 and I thought this movie is very well done. By the way, expect explosions and decent amount of action and some nice humor. Overall, I'd give it 9/10. Better than Age of Extinction for sure and definitely Bay's best movie this year.

No matter how far CGI comes it just ends up looking like a cartoon when it isn't used sparingly, a really expensive cartoon. For those commenters who say it looks realistic, you are probably young. It looks realistic because it's all you know. When I was a very little kid Terminator 2 came out, and we thought the computer animations were so realistic, a few years later Jurassic Park came out, and those Terminator animations suddenly looked so bad and outdated. But Jurrasic Park used them sparingly, and when its sequel came out years later with lots more CGI scenes, those earlier Jurassic Park scenes now looked like crap, but the physical prop dinosaur scenes look better than ever. Same goes for Men in Black. And so on and so on until eventually you can't take rampant CGI seriously.

It just never looks right. No matter how much detail they add, how many different texture effects they use, how cutting edge and expensive they are, I just can't buy it. The lighting never exactly matches with their surroundings, the focus never matches either, and the actors never seem like they're actually talking to anybody.

Yes, these turtles definitely look edgier and slicker, but for a series that was never gritty and dangerous, I'd rather see bad suits than watch the world's most expensive cartoon... (besides ferngully uhh I mean Avatar)",2014-10-04T10:46:22.000Z,0

Michal Bay was the Producer of this film! Not the Director! TMNT are my childhood hero's. And I got to say, the film wasn't bad. I went into it with very low expectations. Now, I'm not saying: ""its a great film!"" But I went in thinking out of 10, it was gonna be about a 2 maybe a 3. But I went out giving it like a 5 or a 6. I like that each of the turtles were distinctly different. Even thought the story line was ""meh"" it was the personality of all four turtles that kept the film going. And just because Megan Fox is in it, she wasn't the star, the turtles were. And I have to say, the new Shredder armour was terrifying and OP (over powered). But you'd think you need that going against four powerful turtles. (Spoiler), although I wish we kinda saw more of Shredder. There were glimpses of him but nothing really more than him spitting cliche dialogue and actions. It was a great chance for them to build Shredder into something bigger other than throwing him in the story. (Another Spoiler) I kinda wish we saw a traditional or original armour that Shredder used before William F. character decided randomly to ""take it to the next level'. I liked his new ""transformer armour"" (once again, going against four powerful ninja turtles, I'd want that kinda armour too. But overall it wasn't a bad film. Not the best Comic book movie adaptation. But the next TMNT film coming out in 2016 I think they'll do it better. ",2014-09-06T03:24:59.000Z,0

This movie really isn't bad it is just really misguided and its basically whats wrong with everything Michael Bay produces. He does it on purpose, if he actually tried to make a good script and screenplay he could achieve hits that are not only critically acclaimed but visually stunning. Take The Avengers for example.

The Avengers is not only visually stunning and has expensive big budget special effects but it is smartly directed and scripted perfectly along with many other Marvel movies like Guardians of the Galaxy. Michael Bay literally doesn't try at all to develop a good script and instead ruins franchises like Transformers and TMNT by making sappy scatterbrained plots that are so absurd they are painful to watch and he somehow thinks mindless action is going to change the fact that his plotting is agonizingly bad and sinks the entire movie.

If it was up to him he would just make 4 hours of nothing but action but he knows damn well people expect at least some plot so he takes a bunch of bullshit ideas (mostly lame plots like love triangles, teenage issues, and annoying 1 dimensional characters) and blends them in with mindless 4 hour action and that is what he calls a movie and get paid a billion dollars every time he does that.

These movies are made by hollywood so if youre expecting an exact replica of the comic book storyline then dont watch it itll always be a dissapointment everytime. You go and you watch and try to enjoy it cuz youre a die hard fan. You love it regardless. Ppl need to get over this idea of comic book movies being made like the comic book. If they were it wouldnt sell and ppl wouldnt know whats going on. They have to relate to old and new audiences. For those who say if you like crappy movies like this then you got bad taste well have you ever thought to yourselves you might be the one with bad taste. Ppl who are die hard fans who still like hollywoods renditions of comic book movies like them cuz theyre die hard fans and they love all sorts of movies in different genres and want to be awwwd not become a critical asshole who complains about comic book movies but yet still goes and watches them whenever a new one comes out. Tmnt started as joke and ended up being what it is today. Id say theyve come along way and deserve a fresh start regardless. I bet most of these asshole comic book movie critics dont even know which turtle of the four started it all... It was mikey... Research... Cuz even the comic book storylines change its how the characters stay alive for so many years and years to come ,2014-08-11T03:59:28.000Z,0

In the 90's everyone loved martial arts in movies & tv shows etc, now people listen to music and surf social websites while they shuffle dance. 2. 80-90's surfer boy lingo WTF is up with that? Now and days celebrities such as Bieber & Miley cyrus act ""Urban"" so no, ""Radical and Cowabunga"" make no sense in a 2014 film. These turtles still eat pizza?, the only reason why the turtles eat pizza on the first film was because it was delivery and at the time (80's) delivery was something popular with companies like Domino's 30minutes or its free being one example, so the original movies thought it fit in well with the trends. Bottom line for a new teenage mutant ninja turtles version it sucked, it made no sense. For a remake it was horrible.

In those older movies we can see them 'real life' in movies, but this CG way makes it seem like they wanted a cheaper way to make this movie than to make the costumes to custom fit a person and to train each turtle actor different moves. in the trailers alone, it looks like something is wrong with them...like they got tumors growing every which way...they look straight up strange. big and bulky and still with their small voices, makes it seem like they fucked creating them and they didnt mature or something. second, shredder looks likes a damn transformer...wtf is with that? This movie is going to suck more like Starship troopers 2 or every movie will ferral comes out with. they really messed up this movie. makes me want to go buy the first 3 TMNT because i feel bad for how they look and they way this movie came out now...LEAVE OLDER MOVIES ALONE!

This film isn't directed by Michael Bay. Michael Bay is only a producer. Actually he's not even the only producer. He shares producer credits with 5 other people: Andrew Form, Bradley Fuller, Galen Walker, Scott Mednickm and Ian Bryce. Basically Michael Bay's involvement in this film is exactly 16.6666666667%. The only reason his name is plastered all over this film is because people know who Michael Bay is and what types of films are his. Basically his name is a marketing gimmick.

It's all about the story of this turtle jihadist converted under the name of Raphaïl al sulih'fat, who saw the light of islam after he found a funny shrimp on his pizza with spots that could be read as the shahada. He tried to convert his weaker fellow turtles, but they where too much on the path of sin, so he sliced their infidel throat during sleep (oriented toward meccah). There's a lot of humour, just like when they have to fix his shell to make it a suicide-one, or when the imam tries to circumcise his funny turtle dick !!!

[SPOILER ALERT] This shown here is the final scene, when Raphaïl arrives in paradise after he detonated himself in a jewish kindergarten, killing hundreds. There, as a reward, he's heavenly serviced by one the beautiful boys whose skin is white and soft like pearls and wearing silver jewelry, as narrated in the holy qu'ran : the perfect role for Princess Miley and her deliciously unfeminine body.",2014-08-02T09:06:46.000Z,1

2014-06-24T15:56:39.000Z,OdgNSJiWJTo,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Official Trailer #2 (2014) - Whoopi Goldberg, Megan Fox Movie HD","Okay, you know what I don't understand about all this?
Fans of the original cartoons: ""OMG they look hideous! I HATE this new design."" ""This is NOTHING like the old design! How creepy!"" ""They EXPECT us to pay to see THIS? Who would see those ugly monsters?""
Hideous. Creepy. Ugly. Monsters.

ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO YOURSELVES?
Since the very beginning, the turtles have established that they are indeed hideous creations to the human race, no matter how cartoony and cute they may have looked in the 80s, 90s, 2003 and 2012 series. To the other cartoon civilians, they were disturbing monsters, and had to hide using their ninja stealth and trenchcoats. Also, wasn't one of their BIGGEST LESSONS that they supposedly taught us as kids was that LOOKS. DO. NOT. MATTER???

I admit that I am fairly new to the franchise, and being a teenage girl I was much more drawn to their cuteness in the 2012 series. But after doing lengthy research on the franchise over the past 3 decades, from the comics up till now, I realized I didn't fall in love with their looks... but as an aspiring animator with a childlike heart, I fell in love with their unique story AND equally unique personalities. Also, they have to make difficult choices and learn lessons  through their adventures that help them grow as characters. I was mixed about it at first, but I might actually have to see this movie, even though I'm very aware it's nothing like the 2012 cartoon I currently adore. It looks much darker and more adult, but you know what? I am an adult and not a pink-and-doll-loving little girl anymore. Therefore, I think I can appreciate a good dark, adult action-comedy, if that what this turns out to be. And from the newer trailers I've seen, the turtles' personalities are VERY lively and true to the consistency of the franchise. True, they're not attractive, but this is 2014 PEOPLE. They can't look like the cuter 80s, 90s, or even 2012 cartoons if they want to get their emotions shown through facial expressions across in a live-action flick. They're not going to use cartoony puppets like the first one, because it's not DIFFERENT. Fresh and new is ESSENTIAL to any good film. The turtles have changed through SO many different interpretations over the years, and that should already be a lesson you've learned if you're over 13. Change happens. Life Happens. SERIOUSLY. I'm not even 20 yet, and I was able to figure that out. So please, people, enough with the butthurt'in and get over it. Nostalgia is a powerful emotion, I know that better than anyone. But it's just that, nostalgia. Time goes on. New memories are created. And with an open mind, you might find that the nostalgia can be found even in something like this.",2014-07-26T22:25:08.000Z,1

No, I don't hate Micheal Bay, I actually like the Transformers movies, but I do dislike how the Turtles look like Knuckles in the new Sonic Boom; completely hopped up on steroids.

I do, however, find it entertaining how they got most personality aspects of the Turtles into this. 

I will go out and see this movie with an open mind, unlike most people when they're faced with things that even mention Micheal Bay. I will judge it to see if it can stand up outside of the action scenes, which I know already from the trailer looks cool.",2014-07-26T21:56:38.000Z,0

1. Whether or not the turtles are actually Teenage, seeing as how they look like 40 year old MMA fighters
2. Whether or not the turtles are Samurai or (as the title implies) ninjas.
3.whether or not it is a Michael Bay film, he only produces it, but every once in a while, it has form of MB cliche in it, ie. Explpsions, slow motion, big towers falling over, and then it has other action film cliches such as corny humor, dumb music, pretty good CGI and guns,, lots of guns.

I grew up with the cartoons, comics, games, movies, etc. I've liked just about everything that's ever been TMNT (even a shout out to The Next Mutation, which was kinda dumb). I, personally, think that anyone that's already condemning this should just look at it this way: If the Ninja Turtles were a real thing, would they look like scary badass mutated turtles? Or would they look like silly cartoonish turtles? Exactly. So just ease up on being so negative on how they made them look in this. I think they look freaking bad ass! They look very similar to those ultra realistic drawings I found online before that someone had made to look really creepy authentic. Seriously, give it a shot. Go into it like it's a totally new thing, not like it's an abomination of something from your childhood. If you want to get technical about it, anyone that is on here complaining about this movie ruining your kids' cartoon, isn't really a true TMNT fan, because it's obvious you never read the original comics. Although they do look cartoon-ish there as well, the original comics are far more badass and violent than the cartoons or previous movies have even come close to.I'm stoked for it!

I like that this movie actually seems to be ABOUT the Turtles, unlike a good portion of the Transformers films, and I'm not completely turned off by their designs. On the other hand, the Shreddinator seems a bit much. Yes, the Shredder has had robotic armor in past incarnations for one reason or another (Mostly in the 2003 cartoon), but despite that he usually posed a big threat to the Turtles because he was just a REALLY good fighter, without a bunch of tricks and gadgets. Giving him powered armor just makes him seem much less impressive.

Take for example another reboot: Batman Begins. It really did justice to a reboot because it kept the series fresh with new ideas.

But the reason I stress that it did justice was because the fresh ideas were believable. Everything made sense in BB - the way Wayne got access to his gadgets, the reason why the Bat costume had ears, the reason why his suit had Kevlar, the way Batman has a cowl in the neck of his costume, but does away with it in the sequel, etc.

Over here, this just seems like the blueprint of the Transformers movie had sex with the blueprint of TMNT, and out came a pile of jumbled up trash. This seems like it is trying very hard to be a credible attempt at a reboot.

A real reboot, like Batman Begins, seems effortless.

This seems like they had the mandate to make a reboot first, and then brainstormed how they should reboot it, rather than a TMNT fan having a genuine epiphany of creative genius, and deciding that a reboot was in order.",2014-07-17T22:43:32.000Z,1

1. We already got a good live action TMNT with no CGI bullshit. This looks like they cranked the action to dangerously retarded levels and the rest will be one liner comic relief.
2. Unlike Transformers, TMNT isn't a dormant franchise that was in need of a modern spin or reboot. There's a TMNT series airing right now that's actually really good.  This movie was probably put into production shortly after the popularity of the turtles flared up when the previous TMNT series ended with that ""Turtles Forever"" special.

1.) Turtles that don't look like trolls
2.) Better visual effects and action sequences.
3.) The Foot Clan actually being Ninja Assassins (although uniting them with ex-military henchmen is not a bad idea)
4.) An Actual Japanese Actor playing Shredder (although I could see Fitchner playing a corporate villain would join forces with Shredder and The Foot along with his (Fitchner) gang of Ex-Special Forces Operatives)
5.) Michael Bay not being involved with the project at all.
6.) A Much better actress to play April 'O' Neil such as Emma Stone, Emma Watson, Jennifer Lawrence or Shailene Woodley.
7.) The mood of the film could've still been family-friendly but also have some Darkness and intensity to it. Something like The Avengers meets Batman Begins type of feel.
8.) A Much better soundtrack. Music that is just as slammin' as Technotronic's music from the original and second Turtle films soundtracks from the 90's. (Spin That Wheel, Awesome, Rocking Over The Beat, Turtle Power, This is How We Do.)",2014-07-01T21:47:25.000Z,0

To be honest not a single televised or silver screen iteration of the turtles has been true to the source material. Outside of season one of the original show which still was not nearly as dark as the comic there has not been a version of the turtles close to what I remember reading years ago. So, all of you are going to have to get over it just like I had to get over the terrible writing for the x-men franchise which completely ignored the source material. However the movies were ok.

I also think if everyone stopped complaining that Michael Bay ruined their childhood before the damn movie has even come out, then they would enjoy it more. We don't know what mutated turtles would look like, they could look like the original turtles from the 90's movies or they could look like Bay's concept or even completely different. Any new idea is interesting. Plus we all know what the original story was, a new story is just as interesting because we could get a new twist & we won't be expecting what happens. If they just redid the story of the 90's movie, we would ALL know what happens. I'm happy that the turtles are coming to the big screen again, they were a big part of my childhood & here they are again.

Also I don't agree with everyone saying that this movie ruins the Turtles they grew up with.

So I'm not going to look at this as a retelling of the original story. I'm going to look at this as its own universe with its own turtles.

I don't think they would give them plastic suits like in the old movies :P and they grasp their battle moves from what I see until now.  

My problems:
What I don't like is Megan Fox having another role on a comic book/cartoon franchise. Seriously? Are there any beautiful red hair girls in Hollywood? Only Megan Fox (brunette actually)? And another ''what a nice ass'' joke?
 I think producers and fans these days cannot understand that fan service, porn and softporn has specific sites and places :P Marketing shouldn't be all about sex. WE NEED SEX EVERYWHERE.....Not. Especially a Transformers or TMNT movie. 

Secondly I don't get the point behind Shredder wearing a hydraulic suit? Wouldn't it be badass to have an actual Asian actor playing Shredder as a powerful martial artist and criminal warlord? This is what Shredder is in the comics and cartoons. The hydraulic armor is just an excuse so that the final battle goes like this:
Shredder kicks everyone's ass until they find a way to deactivate his suit and/or throw him from somewhere or throw something heavy on him :P It is the classic Man vs Machine or Hero vs Stronger Opponent solution in most Hollywood films and it is completely generic that we will see this here too.

Finally I hate dubstep. It is an overestimated and mediocre at best music style. I believe franchises need their own soundtracks orcherstral, epic, rock e.t.c to prevail and be remembered. Dubstep does nothing. Just sells more to young audiences and nothing else, sooo it is another commercial strategy.

We will see. I hope the movie is good overall.   ",2014-06-25T07:55:39.000Z,0
