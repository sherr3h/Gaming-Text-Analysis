I've had them, they'll last easily well over 15 years, very comfortable and warm. In 15+ years I had one, I moved it once or twice, and changed a burned-out thermostat once. Even my dogs slept on them, you just use a lot of blankets. 

If they leak, it's not a big deal. I had one leak in all that time. Very minor. 

Overall, you're at next to zero chance of falling through the floor or putting all the water on the floor. Evenly distributed weight. Same reason a bathtub or a fridge doesn't go through the floor.

It's literally like watching someone's home movies from 1980.  Seriously, NOTHING HAPPENS in this movie that resembles any sort of plot or narrative.  It was offensively tedious.  Also, every character in the movie utterly hates every other character.  No one has anything nice to say about anyone else, insults fly left and right, and no one can do even the simplest of favors for their supposed friends.

Scenes have room to breathe. Characters are fleshed out and given ample screen time. The dialogue is on point, touching and effortlessly hilarious. The casting is perfect. The plot isn't subject to the demands of fanboys or producers. Rather, the film moves at its own casual pace, dipping in and out of parties, random conversations and romance, without much concern for it's final destination. The film is less a story, and more of an experience, one that moved me while also making me smile.",2016-08-12T10:18:46.000Z,1

It is the kind of situation where someone over the age of 50 is telling you about a memorable weekend he had at the age of 19 and then a bubble appears over his head playing this film. I thought it captured the spirit and the essence of the era very well, chemistry among the jocks was great and there is funny script here and there. 
But that is it. There is not much going on here in terms of story progression, you are just seeing faternity having a good time, drinking, cat calling, wanting to get their dicks wet everynight. It is about everybody and about nobody. 
Unfortunately there are too many characters that are lost in the shuffle, there is no Judd Nelson here people and after couple of days it fades away slowly.

Official Trailer #1 (2016) -  Glen Powell, Tyler Hoechlin Comedy HD","Film is a triumph and a considerable one, because its maker is an excellent film-maker. Take a comparison with frat house recent offering:bad Neighbors 2 . Bad Neighbors is ok, but it's not nuanced, it's for crude laughs and doesn't aim to do a lot more than that. However, Everybody Wants Some shows the fun, the babes, the horsing around, the jock oneupmanship and the drinking, but it offers a bit more. It shows an alternate way of living, eg the visit to the punks and the outing to their club. This movie shows the other ways of being. it celebrates the girl who picks out the 'quiet' boy, it shows a desperate wannabe pretender like Willoughby, who's not all that he seems. It shows the fun, with only a very slight message. Above all, there is nothing nasty: no-one breaks their neck when jumping in the lake, no-one knifes anyone in the bar brawl. Linklater doesn't spoil our show with accident, he keeps it a fun comedy. 1980 is reproduced successfully and realistically- the realism, right down to a jar of Kraft Miracle Whip in the fridge is absolutely amazing. Some say this is a very male movie, it's about lads, it's male interests, it's the male gaze. When you see an old woman in the canteen serving you realise you've only seen young fresh faces right throughout this film! Sport is taken a little too earnestly by the 'boys', I think this is an ironical little dig at sport obsessiveness. I liked the part where the blond dude was chatting up a chick with a view that he'd be a good father, only to be ridiculed by his pals: he says rightly that they talk about girls all the time when they play ball, but when they're with girls all they talk is baseball. Isn't that a wry and smart observance of young men, the way they bullshit and tease and endless vie and compete, over everything? Including a game of knuckles in one case here. Above all, the scenes are a pleasure to view: the viewer's comfort and ease are considered: the car trips, the ball practice on the extensive green, the clubbing, the psychedelic night at the house, the Alice in wonderland sequence (which I thought was truly great and showed improvisation, akin to a moment in the theatre, even). Everybody Wants Some has aspects of 1992's Wayne's World combined with That 70s Show. All fresh faces too, unfamiliar acting cast (I swear there is one Ashton Kutcher lookalike here!). Everybody wants to go see Everybody Wants Some!",2016-06-28T03:56:35.000Z,20
