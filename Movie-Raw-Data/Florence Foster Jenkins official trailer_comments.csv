You may not like the person but you have to be able to step back and see the bigger picture and what really matters. It's for this reason that I won't automatically boycott any movie she's in, if you do that you're falling in the same negativity trap that Meryl Streep did. If you miss a good film it's more your loss than anyone else's.

i saw this film few days ago. the film is nice..i experienced the same in my life recently....i think on Friday i catch the train to harries park while my journey i so pissed off and disturbed... you know about train everyone is busy with their cell phones... so i want to get rid of my disturbed mind and make myself happy so what i did is while i am listening to the songs at the same time i am singing... to be honest i am really bad at singing.... i am singing out loud and everyone is laughing the male and female who are sitting behind me she is laughing out loud and the male trying to stop me from singing..i know that everyone is laughing and its sound funny any way i don't care about  them but it changed my mood from some thing disgusting to happiness when i reached the station all i feel is happy by just recalling what i did in the train.... 

i am telling you this because when i saw this film i am laughing out loud by seeing the character and by remembering my what i did in train (i am laughing at myself as well as the character).....they are pretty much similar....",2016-06-04T05:34:33.000Z,0
