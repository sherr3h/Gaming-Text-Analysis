I often said to myself that I will stop looking for rating that film critics gave to particular movie. This film is breaking point, I shall no more check ratings of the movie cause I finally understand what they are. A lie. Their whole perception is distorted. For example this is perfect film. Yes Godfather is also and that is clear, so why it is not clear to them about this film is strange indeed. For example we have two man. First one eats the apple so he know what is apple. The second one is trying to describe apple but they never eat it. First person who is healthy in mind eats apple. The other who try his best to perfectly describe it but never eats is not healthy in mind and is like movie critics. At least most of them. So from now I will 100% ignore their opinion, its like concept about something you never have experience of. They watch movie, but their perception is distorted. Its quite good to ignore them.

Poirot is a character who knows who he is and what he can do, he is very humble, never arrogant. If he does not interfere, it is because he thinks its not worth his time or anyones time really. Not because he is lazy or wants to hide and read Dickens lol.. And he tries to avoid drama, he delivers justice and uncovers the truth in his own cold and grounded way.

The real Poirot is at a whole different level than the man in this movie who I think is made like this for the purpose of attracting the public views.

The cinematography was superb, and the actors were outstanding. The accents were very well done, and contrary to some people's opinions, I understood every word of it (maybe and most likely because I had help from subtitles). In conclusion, it's an amazing movie, but it is definitely only for those curious minds who don't mind too much dialogue, and who's satisfaction is not only brought by guns and explosions. 9.8/10",2018-08-05T11:46:03.000Z,70

The actors were a great choice I just hoped it would‚Äôve portrayed the novel a bit better considering it‚Äôs not a very big book. Anyways though cinematography was excellent and I‚Äôd still recommend for people to watch.",2018-02-25T11:51:59.000Z,41

So basically the passenger that died killed the daughter of mr. and mrs. Armstrong which caused mrs. Armstrong to go into shock which also caused her to go into labor and she died along with her baby. Mr Armstrong sent a letter to the detective but committed suicide before the detective received it. Everyone on the train had a connection to either the Armstrong family or the victim himself. Everyone had something against the victim. Basically every passenger killed him. Hence the 12 stabs he had.  The detective didn‚Äôt report them to the authorities though because he believes justice was served here.

2017-06-01T13:00:34.000Z,Mq4m3yAoW8E,Murder on the Orient Express | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"The movie ""Orient Express"" (all versions) was inspired by a real person, called Eugen Alimanescu, a romanian police commissioner. At the time it was called ""Justice"", ""The invincible"" or ""The Iron Commissioner"". In 1946, several crimes took place in the selection of the ""Orient Express"" train that traveled on the Paris - Bucharest - Istmabul route. These took place in the Romanian train sector, and the victims were, in turn, a Swiss diplomat and a Soviet diplomat. As cases risked taking other interpretations given the quality of the assassins, a quick resolution was required. Eugen AlimƒÉnescu, a romanian police commissar,  was responsible for solving it. He succeeded in detecting a few elements common to the two crimes, so he deduced that they were committed by the same murderer, perhaps a very stylish one considering the place where they were. Disguised as a businessman, Alimanescu managed to identify the killer and dragged him into a race. Without anything, the murderer tried to rob the ""businessman"" Alimanescu and at the same time to kill him. He was shot (injured), and at the hospital in Arad where he was taken to get his first aid, he died. Not before confessing the two crimes committed on the train.",2018-01-27T22:52:39.000Z,0

It's forced, not interesting, no suspence, simply boring. How can you compare the creations of Penelope with Ingrid Bergman? Bergman was remarkable. The version from the 70ties is a classic. Interesting, well played, the music is just amazing. When Branagh says: ""I'm Hercule Poirot, probably the most famous detective in the world"", I had enough. I was sitting and waiting for the movie to end. I don't recommend at all. The only scenes I liked was when the train was leaving Istanbul, we could see some great takes of the evening city and also at the end when the train was approaching Brod, we  could see some nice takes of the mountains covered in snow. Other than that, I didn't like the movie at all.

2017-06-01T13:00:34.000Z,Mq4m3yAoW8E,Murder on the Orient Express | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"The movie was good but somehow i think the audiences were made clueless to the murderer as compared to the 1974 version with albert finney, ingrid bergmam, sean connery, lauren bacall,etc. The old version had more character development, some of the characters here (spoiler) confessed as the murderer. In the 1974 version, Poirot figured out who the murderers are without any confession from the passengers. There were also more reasons as to why some things were said (the grease on Helena's passport, Why Mrs Hubbard kept saying 2nd Husband, ""Grunwald""), the face to face with Princess Dragomiroff was also incomplete and lacking information (the old version led Poirot into figuring out who Elena and Debenham were). Combining the doctor who did not murder with the colonel who did was a questionable idea, adding the fact that the colonel not only shot but confessed that he was one of the murdered....People who love this version should watch the old one too...",2017-12-01T03:06:02.000Z,0

Same as w/ Dark Tower and The Last Airbender, enjoyed both despite book fans trashing them. If you want to see this and arent familiar w/ the book don't tell anyone when you go so you can have a genuine ""oh ok... I didn't see that comin"" moment at the end. I'm usually ""decent"" at figuring out where a plot is going but impossible to get this one without prior knowledge.

Trust me, those beautiful train and mountains looks gorgeous on huge screen. This is the best movie of the year. 1934 is beautifully displayed in the movie. I really love those days. My grandfather and grandmother were young in those years. Anyway every actor is terrific, but the real hero is the story. The climax is really ""unthinkable"". Agatha Christie is really a mastermind. As for Hercule Poitor, he is a real competitor to Sherlock Holmes. And I am sure in future he will also return like SH. Overall I enjoy the movie. One last thing. The love, pain and agony of losing a loved one or see suffering of a loved one is very strong emotion. It can only a feel by a person who has gone through the experience in his\her real life. I wonder how many of our current young android generation will feel that strong emotion?",2017-11-26T18:17:49.000Z,0

There were few  unnecessary scenes that weren't in the book (which is not a bad thing it just shows director's creativity and all). The dialouges were somehow 
 awkward but maybe it's just me who feels that way. What made the film bad for me could be that in the book we have a lot more about interviews with the passengers and whole story was more humoristic when film is more concentrated around Daisy and Armstrong's tragedy.  Well it's just mine opinion. Everyone who's going to see the film should judge by their own. The whole realization was fantastic though. And the cast just briliant!",2017-11-25T23:23:25.000Z,0

Never in a million years would Agatha Christie's Poirot eat a cake off the same plate as someone, his manners weren't as they should be and what's with waking up as if he's had a rough night clubbing. Not to mention his tie wasn't even straightened most of the time and he was in general too loud and it didn't feel right. Speaking as someone who has read the books, this Poirot was a flop.

I would've loved it to be a box office smash. Yes, it is reasonably similar to every single other adaptation and it may distracting having so many big names in the film.
But I can see why Mr Branagh made this film. Christie become a niche forgotten figure in the 2010s and even though I wouldn't recommended her writing to very small children, I think that 13-14 year should read Murder on the Orient Express. It's a lesson in creativity, suspence, style and descriptive writing. In other words, it was made to make Christie fresh for today and to educate youngsters about great writing.",2017-11-19T22:45:52.000Z,0

2017-06-01T13:00:34.000Z,Mq4m3yAoW8E,Murder on the Orient Express | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"the movie is terribly disappointing. Firstly, I don't think the actor for Poirot really understands what he's like. It doesn't let anyone absorb inside the movie from Poirot's view. And he was also...not the Poirot type we Poirot fans know. Secondly, the actor for Macqueen is really most terrible at acting out his character--Josh Gad! Sure he's very good at Jolly characters, but not a rather serious character like Hector Macqueen. It's very different from the Macqueen I imagine. Thirdly, they changed too much from the book. I think they rather hurried through the part about interrogating the passengers, (which is actually the part for you to think)and they changed Monsieur Bouke too. I think a good suspense is to change when you must, but the key parts mustn't change. Overall, this is a good thriller, but it will never become a great suspense.",2017-11-16T14:18:53.000Z,1

Suchet went into great lengths to not make his accent sound that way. Plus he looks too good to look like a little Belgian detective in the shape of an egg. Sorry, but this is not how Poirot is supposed to look like. In a 1924 book a first drawing of Poirot was made and Christie herself said that it was pretty close to what she envisaged him. This drawing can be seen here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poirot_Investigates . Now compare it with how all the actors depicted Poirot and you'll easily see that this one is not really close and why Suchet's portrayal is so highly rated.",2017-11-13T13:40:07.000Z,0

I was skeptic all when I heard about Poirot being rebooted but (with the exception of that moustache) this film seems to know exactly what to update and exactly what to keep the same. I'm a huge fan of the David Suchet show and I didn't think I could really accept anyone else in the role; this felt like a much older and more jaded Poirot than we've seen before though, which fit very well with the themes of the book and the twist about who the murderer is.

I will always love both the classic original film version starring Albert Finney, Sean Connery, Anthony Perkins, Lauren Becall & Sir John Gielgud and the David Suchet version from the Poirot TV series but Branaugh as Hercule Poirot in MOTOE sounds like a serious match made in Heaven & I love the rest of the cast that they've assembled here :)

1. ratchet isn't this young.
2. Mrs Hubbard's voice should be irritating and she is more talkative
3. Not being racist but why did they make the doctor black?
Token black guy?why not stick to the book and make him Greek
3. Hercules mustache..oh god what's that mop on his face? It's suppose to be a bit morr thinner
4. The accent is wrong and what's with that last line?
He sounded more like Sherlock

The writer of the novel this film was based on, Agatha Christie, had an experience with the doctor. Explain. Explain! EXPLAIN!!!!!

Holly, the computer of the mining ship Red Dwarf, read everything in the ship's database. He asks Dave Lister, the last human being alive, to erase Agatha Christie from his memory banks so it'll be new to him. Of course it kinda backfires because he never heard of Agatha Christie. He never heard of Agatha Christie because his memory got erased. Why did Lister do that? Holly asked him too.

Let's set it to Imagine Dragons because every period piece (and this is a period piece) needs to be scored by Imagine Dragons.  Then let's put a really fake-looking moustache on Kenneth Branagh and call him Hercule Poirot. And by fake-looking? I mean his hair, which looks terribly messed-up and utterly unlike the prissy, appearance-conscious little Belgian, is overshadowed by a facial topiary that Salvador Dali would have found too outre'.",2017-07-16T04:46:39.000Z,0

There are so many Indians in England (as well as the rest of the world) and they could not find a man of Indian background to play the role of an British-Indian colonel? I thought that ""they"" were moving forward in the movie industry trying to bring in more Indians and people of other backgrounds onto the screen. I guess not.

I have nothing against African Americans but this is a movie about people of different backgrounds on a train. How many people are already playing an American character in that movie? I read the book years ago but I can still remember there being like 4 or 5 American characters on the train.

If they had put in a Bollywood actor in for the role of Arbuthnot, they could have attracted a whole lot more viewers to go see it in theater. Oh well.",2017-07-15T22:49:18.000Z,1

In the book there's a Dr. Constantine and a General Arthunbot, but in the movie he's essentially a mix of both. But the general was a suspect while the doctor helped Poirot investigate (well yeah he was technically a suspect too but u kno what I mean). Would Poirot let the guy he suspected from the beginning (along with Mary Debenham) investigate with him and hear all of his suspicions? Would he trust a fellow suspect to examine the body?

I absolutely adore the larger than life take that they're doing with this. I feel like most movies and adaptations these days have to be all dark and gritty, and though a lot of Madame's works are fairly dark, there's always a sorta lightness/colorfulness that I associate with them. I can tell this movie is definitely gonna play up the classic, idk how to word it, not ""goofiness"", and not even ""lightheartedness"" but...just take a look at the website for the movie, and you'll see what I mean by how it feels like they're portraying it as if it were a game. And thats a good thing! I love it and I can't wait for this to come out! Also, yeah, I'm not the BIGGEST fan of Branagh's Poirot, but we still have to see how he does.

The song gives this old story a new and exciting, contemporary feel especially with the electric beats that start when the detective begins walking through the train while everyone is introduced.

I only bring this up, because I'm a huge fan of David Suchet's rendition of the character, not only in his acting, but also in his manner of dress reflecting his instinctual need for things to be in the proper place. His Hercule Poirot is very groomed in his waxed moustache, managed hair, and clothing. Not to mention his very thick accent, showing that French is his first, and more preferred, language.
Now what do I see with this Hercule Poirot? Messy hair, bushy unkempt moustache, crooked tie, and an accent that is very 'light'. He looks like he's going to rob the train, not solve a murder.
Also the line ""I am probably the greatest detective in the world."" that is quite unlike Poirot's character. If anything he says ""I AM the greatest detective in the world!"" as he is proud of his intellect and has the accolades to attribute to it. He's vein, but that's just apart of his character, showing that even a brilliant mind can also have flaws such as pride.

I'm also a little skeptical of the inclusion of a black man.  I get it, they want to add a person of color to diversify the whiteout, but this story takes place in the 1930s aboard a First Class cabin car on a train heading from Istanbul to Venice.  Not many black men to be found in such a circumstance.  This is just a sop to modern PC sensibilities and it's out of place.",2017-06-02T12:34:06.000Z,0

2017-06-01T13:00:34.000Z,Mq4m3yAoW8E,Murder on the Orient Express | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"Murder on the orient express was one of my favorite episodes on the tv show Poirot. And David Suchet not only NAILED the part of Poirot but he executed this episode with the utmost finesse. Agatha Christie wrote this book to show the humane side of Poirot highlighting a major conflict of belief. And Suchet did it justice, by the end of the episode I was bawling and applauding because very few actors have left me in awe of their performance. Suchet is Poirot. There will never be another. Saying that, I won't dismiss this movie before watching it. A lot of effort goes into movie making. To discredit it after watching a trailer seems to be rather unfair. My first book was Agatha's and my childhood was filled with a lot of Poirot watching. Now, I'm not a fan of many people in the world. But I AM a fan of Mr. David Suchet!! Good luck to this movie.

True fans of Christie's books know this isn't just another murder mystery. This is the Queen of Crime - one of her gems: Poirot is one of the most complex, fascinating detectives ever written. Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov, and now Branagh have taken a crack at Poirot. But David Suchet is Hercule Poirot, hands down. Unfortunately, I automatically think Branagh pales in comparison, to Christie's Poirot, but that's just me. This looks too modern/2017-ish. The ambiance isn't here. Even if the plot sticks to the book perfectly, I don't sense Christie here, unlike the adaptations with Ustinov and Suchet, if that makes sense - not trying to insult Branagh/cast/writers etc. Though I do hope people viewers who watch this get excited, read her books, and watch Agatha Christie's Marple (Rutherford, Hickson, Lansbury, McEwan, and McKenzie , to decide which actress u like enjoy the most) and Poirot. Christie's daughter said she believed Suchet's Poirot - her mother would've been very proud of it.",2017-06-02T04:20:01.000Z,35

Kenneth Branagh not only will direct a new modern adaptation of this novel, but also he will portray Poirot himself. Yet the one thing that caught my attention was the mustache. I certainly have doubts of how this film is going to be when it gets the big screen, but I‚Äôm anxious to see it.",2017-06-01T13:46:30.000Z,1
