Cars 2 and Monster University are a direct result of that deal. I was about to say they also cancelled Newt because of that, but it seems the reason was plot similarities with Rio.

Still, two things need to be said:

1. Their movie for 2014 is an original, The Good Dinosaur.

I wanna see what boo looked like in the end of Monster's Inc when Sulley opened the door and saw her. It's been 11 years, I'm getting impatient, and I don't care about the prequel as much as I want a sequel to the first movie. I know why you trashed the first idea but you should have taken it into consideration. Also, consider making an incredibles 2 that cliffhanger was just as bad. I mean you made a Cars 2, just take what I said into consideration. :)

thanks,

In Monsters Inc at the end he sees her again and everyone must have there own imagination on what happens after that, maybe they don't want to ruin that, they want everyone to have there own thought of what happens, so they decide to go back and make how they became friends, the plot is how they over come there differences and become best friends, I think it's going to be really good :)",2012-06-23T15:37:18.000Z,0

Often times they'll change the title names to gain a broader audience just like Disney did with Tangled. Instead of calling it Rapunzel and having it aim just towards little girls, they named it Tangled so it might also appeal to little boys.

Of course i'm not saying it's a bad film it's still a good film from Pixar, just the weakest out of them all. Also, that's all honestly your own opinion on Cars. I didn't find the storyline predictable or anything and it didn't feel lazy, it felt like a lot of work was put into it such as any other Pixar film. Cars 2 is still up there in my favorite Pixar films. :3",2012-06-21T06:19:39.000Z,0

Just ignore that. Also, while I agree Pixar has never made a bad film Brave just doesn't look like the type of movie I would be into, which is surprising since it's made by Pixar. I probably won't be seeing it in theaters, but i'll definately check it out when it comes out on DVD. Also, if you can tell me if it's good or not? That would help me. :3",2012-06-21T06:17:18.000Z,0

So in fourth or fifth grade.  But this movie takes place FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE Monsters Inc., meaning that Boo won't be born for another twelve years.

Obviously, Monsters Inc. is set around 2005.  One clue is that Boo has a stuffed Nemo, which would not have existed until 2003.  And if Boo is four or five in 2007, she must have have been two or three in 2005.
