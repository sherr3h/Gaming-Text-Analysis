2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Despite the hype this is fairy ok movie. The problem here is bad casting.  The female lead characters should be a strong feminist. AV did her best in this movie. she is a very good method actress. Best suited for innocent,fragile characters such as Light between Oceans, Royal affair. She doesn't has the strong feminist look or frame. Imagine Iron Man played by someone other than Robert J or Wolverine played by some one other than Huge J or Thanos. Casting does miracles. If found the right match it shines. Unfortunately they made a bad casting. And movie is also has lot of plot holes. Though Anjelina is bad actress she is best suited for feminism. If this is a movie a girl lost a father at young age and again find him and with some adventure this could have been acceptable. For a Tomb Raider movie this plot is horrible. Being a countess the female lead can't speak multi languages and does learn combat skills in a cheap dojo doesn't add up with a girl with such a rich lineage. And who the hell wan't to remove a mummy from a tomb. Because it is the most valuable part of the treasure. Usually tomb robbers take the tomb. And father lived there for years with out seen by any one with out food is also incredible.",2019-07-02T14:49:15.000Z,0

She just pawned something her father gave her, so she can fund her trip.  All suspension of belief is gone at this point.  I can already see it...they sat around a table, and said, ""No, we can't have her sign the papers and suddenly be wealthy, to fund her trip, which may be the sane choice that literally what every last real human would do...no, let's have her pawn something her father gave her...but to make it more interesting, let's make it seem like she is now going to be operating on a shoestring budget.  That way her accomplishments aren't because of her daddy's money...because daddy's are evil and bad and stuff...and so is their money...unless we want new shoes, or a new car.""


Movies such now.  Technology is such that all movies should pretty dang good, but they can't resist the feminist, SJW bs, and so they literally ruin every movie they make now.",2019-07-01T04:34:57.000Z,0

Credit where it's due: The games are very well made.
But it's not Tomb Raider, on principle.
Tomb Raider was like the Legend of Zelda with guns, and a badass female lead;
 ALSO FIGHTING A T-REX.
Tomb Raider 2013 would be like making Pokemon into a super edgy, hyper violent monster summoning anime where the Poke-balls are magical artifacts and the Pokemon kill each other.
Or like turning Grand Theft Auto into a ""Street Gangsta works undercover for the police to overthrow an illegal network of car-thieves and chop-shops"".
Or like if they remade Devil May Cry's Dante into a hard-boiled detective who has to stop a secret demon invasion when he learns that his father, who taught him the trade of being a Private Investigator, was actually a demon spy who betrayed the armies of Hell and discovers he has super powers.
That'd be like if Resident Evil swapped out Umbrella and the B.O.W.s for a Necromancer Cult and supernatural zombies and demons.
The 2013 remake completely took the game and turned it upside down and removed everything that made Tomb Raider an individual compared to other games.",2018-12-01T21:33:16.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,Hey guys.... so. This should have got 4 stars easily. Watched it twice. Well thought out.  Clever. I approve as a tomb raider fan. If I had to say anything about this movie it would be.....  thank you. You nailed Lara in her early days. First tomb etc. First time I saw this I thought once she  got to the island the villain was a lil over the top. Like a cliche of most villains. But. as it went on I got it.... so it may be cliche or is it??? Yes... no.... wait..... huh??? I can't be quite sure. It was well done and I love it. Guys.... keep it going your on to something that will reverberate through the years. Yes you got inspiration from the games. But. I think you have interpreted gameplay to cinematic emotional reaction or something like that perfectly or as close to perfectly and acceptable for most of us. You captured Lara's bravery and everything we( Okay maybe just me) love about Lara.  Haters will hate.. but whatever. You have something and I hope you keep it going. I would give this 4 n a half to five stars. Looking forward to more from you guys,2018-11-27T03:32:07.000Z,0

Warner Brothers is so Petty and Vindictive they wouldn't allow the Fans of the show to hold Conventions and Sell T-Shirts, they also wouldn't put out any Posters of the Cast either. Then to really stick it to the Fans of the TV Series, they did a ""Re-Make of the Series and called it ""Nikita"". They always told the Fans of LFN they couldn't give Nikita a Happy Ending, but in their Make over of the show where they even used the same names for their characters. They not only gave the charater of Nikita her Freedom, but a Happy Ending to boot. Leaving LFN Fans with an Open Ending. Yeah you could say I'm ""Miffed"" at ""WB"".",2018-10-05T20:32:38.000Z,0

Se muy bien que los fans de Tomb Raider entenderan, es una lastima que peliculas como esta, tan perdidas de contexto, sean expuestas en cine, con razon esta clase de peliculas termina fracasando y al publico no le termina gustando. Tan solo nombrare 3 aspectos fundamentales que estan fuera de todo contexto con la verdadera historia: 1 lara no  es y nunca ha sido una empleada,  repartidora ni nada por el estilo, mucho menos se  comporta asi menos teniendo 21 a√±os, ese comportamiento ni siquiera se da a los 15, pero que les pasa a los productores y/o escritores?  2 Lara nunca en su vida encuentra a su padre vivo, menos lo encuentra como un vil andrajoso y casi loco, tan solo lo ve en visiones y con ayuda de artefactos extra√±os. 3 La princesa himiko nunca habia estado enferma ni es portadora de ninguna enfermedad, pero que le pasa a esta gente que escribe??  Estamos viendo otra repeticion en la cual encuentran otro tipo de caja de pandora, la cual tambien tiene una plaga o enfermedad que afecta a la humanidad tipo tomb raider la cuna de la vida??? Himiko era la reina del sol, controlaba sol y la lluvia, por eso no se podia ir a esa isla tan facil ni salir. Que desepcion de historia, en cuanto a lo demas pues esta bien, efectos y eso pues comun, pero historia, cero, para nada, que lastima que da√±en las cosas asi......",2018-10-03T03:27:09.000Z,0

 Maybe she packed a razor (not gonna throw that out), but Croft isn't really known for being the girly girl who packs makeup or toiletries.

The new 2 Tomb raider games were perfect that came out, I cant wait for the third. I was a little skeptical at first, but I finally watched this last night and I have to say 10/10. I watched it twice. I'm not understanding all the hate,  because if you didn't really like this, then you would have not really like the first game because I would say about 45 to 50% of the movie was the game, The ones who played know what I'm talking about. Alicia Vikander kicked ass in this movie, I really dont think anyone else would have done the same. I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie. The budget was 90 million and it did 273 million at the box office, so I know there will be another one. People have to realize this is Laura Croft before the tomb raider thats why this movie was not like the old ones,  this is a different story",2018-06-17T15:25:52.000Z,5

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"It sucked. Just because it showed some suspence with the airplane and the followup parachute flight and a drop in the river, well, those were the only references to the game that was full of locations and adventure. Mathias sucked as compared to the game Mathias , Himiko was nothing similar to the game Himiko, the whole story was shortened and altered to death. Other somewhat similar points were Mathias trying to act ruthless and his sadistic followers who would  kill a beautiful girl rather than having fun with her, they haven't gotten laid in forever as it is. I loved killing them in the game. Ruthless assholes need killing. I found also very odd in the game, that there were no other women around, except Samantha and Lara. Guess they are all gay then, both in the game and the movie. And where the hell were the other crew members, not to mention that the Endurance in the movie is just a rusty fishing boat. The one in the game was a modern big ship. In the movie they act the same as in the game, mindless zombies with assault rifles. At least in the game had pistols, bows, machetes,makeshift armor, etc, survival mode. In the movie, they are well equipped. And what the hell was that with the father ? In the game the father is maybe dead, maybe not, he does not show up in the game whatsoever. All in all, the game was immensely enjoyable, she is a lot tougher in the game, in the movie she is getting bitch slapped by everyone.So much for her kickboxing skills. The movie is full of huge holes and nowhere near the game. The game is far superior.",2018-06-02T19:38:34.000Z,0

I also really wanted to see the rest of the team but.. .. Um...It was still good but could have been better

You know what, I'd also prefer Himiko coming back to life to make things even more difficult and interesting",2018-05-31T02:07:54.000Z,3

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,I like all of the Tomb Raider movies.  But I especially like the actress that plays Lara Croft in this newest story.   Dominic West is always good. Walton Goggins too.  But the main character really does a great job making Lara Croft seem a bit more down to earth.    Not to imply that Angelina Jolie is not an incredible actress.    There is no comparison.    Really good new story.........,2018-05-30T22:11:38.000Z,4

Actors did quite a good job, and the cinematics were pretty too, but this movie just lacked the tomb raider spirit. Counting the fact that they relied on 2013 tomb raider game's plot they should've just stuck to it rather than turning himiko into ebola spreading mummy or making lara's and her father's reunion the only magical moment in the entire movie. It's like creators knew nothing of the franchise. They completely wasted all the potential that tomb raider world could have offered, and created another soulless hollywood ""action"" movie.

Watched the movie, which was one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Above all the rest, here is what bothered me:
1) A corpse, dead for, what, millennia, can still transmit a DISEASE that kills in few SECONDS? I would have largely preferred the supernatural side.
2) So, a woman can transmit a disease with her touch and what do the japanese do according to the movie? They freaking build a huge tomb inside a mountain! Fucking burn the body, problem solved!
3) Why is it that in every fucking movie where there's a tomb conceived to prevent someone or something to escape there's always also a fucking door that can be easily opened?
4) Why the fuck did Lara Croft's father ask Lara to burn the Himiko Project papers? If he was so worried that the bad guys could find them, what was the point of having Lara do it instead of himself?? That didn't make any sort of sense.
5) What kind of stupid evil company which does illegal things puts its own logo on the equipment used to do the above mentioned illegal things?
6) What kind of human being goes from working as a deliveroo in London to killing people without even flinching?",2018-03-24T20:14:11.000Z,0

SPOILERS.                                           First off the girl who plays her is a crapy  actress who needs to eat a hamburger. I mean in the game they lowered her bra size not make her a double for a UFC fighter. Second she's annoying and stupid. Her father is missing 7 years but she won't sign papers saying he's dead because that will make him dead. Hello stupid sign the papers and now you have the resources to go looking for him and then if you find him you can just give him back his stuff. Instead she risks losing his house, company, and everthing he worked for, as well try to pawan the necklace that was her mothers and the last thing he gave her.In the game she newly graduated as archeologist, movie... never went to collage. Because all this knowledge is like magically in her head? Game has friends who go with her to island, some who don't make it back, which is one of the reasons she had such a hard time in the second game.  Movie she meets some radom dude they become very close so they will risk their lives for each other. There is no Jonah, no captain, no anyone from the actual crew of the endurance. Game Hemeko was and evil witch type creature whose existence made lara believe in myths and legends. Movie she was a queen who sacrificed herself so the world would survive a disease that she carried. Those proving There is no magic, and myths are just that, myths. Second movie, you meet Ana, you think she is on your side so shock when you find out otherwise. Movie you find out at the end that she is working for them. Sorry had to get this off my chest. So if you don't mind that, or haven't played the game maybe you'll like it.",2018-03-16T23:30:20.000Z,3

What happened to innovation? What happened to making good movies just based on the character instead of copying a game? It just says LAZY DIRECTING and PRODUCTION to me.Yeah this will probably run in the theaters for about a month and then disappear to later come out in iTunes or HULU.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Well technically you could almost count Jumanji as a success. As it was based within a game story format. That probably is going to be as close as we're ever going to get to any kind of true success story here. 

As far as Tomb Raider goes it sounds like it's a hit and miss.  For starters Alicia as good as she is was completely miscast here. 

Not nearly as painful as her husband in Assassin's Creed. But bad enough to pretty much guarantee another 10 years in the crypt vault lol. 

I was really hoping it was going to be different this time but it seems that directors just can't help themselves. 

Always thinking they can do a better job than what the original source material had given us. 

Seriously I was expecting something with a little bit more effort put forth here. Instead of just cheery picking scenes. 

Then copy and pasting a script on top of it as that's just lazy writing. Hollywood needs to do us a favor and just stop embarrassing themselves. R.I.P. Tomb Raider",2018-03-15T00:00:11.000Z,0

*superhero posture* ""I'll take two.""

Um... okay? Thanks for coming by the shop. I'll phone you in about a week while your background check goes through... crazy lady. Lol.

I'm sorry but this just gets way too cringy for me. The game was wonderful because it showed how human Lara Croft is. How she perseveres DESPITE the fact that she gets impaled by a rusty spike, or gets shot by bloodthirsty men who want to skin her.

She takes the scars and gets dished some serious punishment, but always licks her wounds, and by the overwhelming will to survive, manages to succeed in spite of those injuries.

If they turn her into some sort of crazy superhero, they've broken the new Lara into a cheap action motif. It's boring. There's no humanity to it.

Sorry, but I'm going to have to pass on this movie. Hollywood dropped the ball yet again.

Lara Croft has been notoriously known as an emotionless, fearless, arrogant and pissed off treasure hunter.
It must be this ""modern cinema"", that wants to make original ""cartoonish"" characters into more ""everyday people""
Huge boobs has been a distinct part of Lara Croft, sure you can say ""SEXIST PIG, normal women dont have such boobs and arent supposed to be that pretty or slutty. But THIS IS, how Lara Crofts character was ORIGINALLY thought up.
Lara Croft IS A CHARACTER, Duke Nukem IS A CHARACTER, Urkel IS A CHARACTER.

In the game queen himiko is a dangerous sorceress and the undead samurais were awesome. The movie has no samurais, and it seems queen himiko buried herself coz she was carrying some disease. The only thing they have copied from the game is the plane sequence, where Lara falls down from a waterfall. The story is utter shit and lacks imagination. The stunts look good in trailer, but in the movie, by the time the stunt scenes arrive, you feel like killing yourself. The game, tomb raider 2013, was a revolutionary cult classic. The movie is utter fucking shit that does not even utilise the plot points of the game. And Alicia looks like a starving puny model, rather than the muscular and well structured Lara we love.",2018-03-10T12:26:05.000Z,0

The character had big tits and sexy as hell what we have here is a masculinised version. Anjelina Jolie hit the mark as a good recreation of Croft. Its Lara Croft in name only & just another poor feminist action movie attempt to promote women.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Games that turn out in movies never did go so well
Take it as Angelina Jolie who played Tomb Raider. It was an icon but it sucked dick.
Same goes for the Assassins Creed with Michael Fassbender. Again, it sucked dick.
Warcraft 2016, sucked dick, i didn't even watch it due to predictions that i knew it was going to be bad, and funny thing is it did turn out bad.
Need for speed 2014, again a shit movie, didn't even watch it. (took it based on ratings)

At the end of the day, I'm not certain that tomb raider would be a good film. The trailer has given the plot away and already it sounds so generic. Father dies, gives his life's work to son/daughter and now the world is on someone's hand to save it. Then chuck in some John Wick/007 action, but in a jungle with a bow to stop some evil conspiracy.

All I'm saying is, there is a high chance that film will go out badly, because the previous movies that originated from games sucked dick.

And let's admit it, boys played the game so they can have something to stare at during their jerk-off session when the parents aren't home.

When you wake up and think what have you done with your life since the original. When you find out Eidos Interactive is no more and never heard of Square Enix... Square What?  When you remember skipping College to play Tomb Raider on the PS1 then returning the next day to find everyone hooked up to the LAN playing Quake 1... When you think you prefer the original with Angelina Jolie, I mean really can you really make it any better than the first, but when you have an interest in the new film... When you watch the trailer and then hope for so much more then think again of the original.... When you have watched the first one so many times you know all the words.... When you realise you won't remember any of the words of the new version and probably not watch it hundreds of times but just a few.... When you hope Angelina will do a Sean Connery and come back as Lara in 'Tomb Raider: Never Say Never'....When Dr Who becomes a lady and hear rumours about the next James Bond being a female and wonder where it will stop. Will the next Lara be a man? Hang on that is Indiana Jones. When you wonder if Chris Barrie from Red Dwarf will make a special guest appearance as the Butler in slippers and shotgun... When you really enjoyed the amazing cars bikes and guns of the original watch the trailer for the new one and find out Lara is now riding a bicycle and firing arrows...  When you work out that there is so much CGI in films these days is any of it real... When you know you will watch it anyway... When you appreciate a new Tomb Raider film but can't help but wonder how Time Flies...",2018-01-25T12:53:51.000Z,1

becuse she needs to know about her father ...
thats exactly 2013 reboot saga.

I DO THINK 
that the casting of her is a match becuse the 2k13 version
is not that sexistic as Angies version and 90's tale.

i remember Lara Croft has allways had jungle and puzzles ,
creatures since playstation 1

So basicly what we are going to see in this movie is depth ,

I REALLY HOPE
they carry out the depth of he origin as TDK TRIOLOGY

Keep Alicia
Hire

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"This looks like its based heavily on the 2013 tomb raider (game). And if that is true (im 97% sure of this), then they are trying to make Lara Croft into what she is in her later adventures: experienced. And in the game they made sure to make her afraid, uncertain and hurt (a lot) to make her a dynamic character, and to make her more relatable. And i believe they did a great job in that factor in the game. But here they are trying to make it out that shes done all this before and all like she knows what to do. And thats an awful idea. Stop trying to make it out that all main characters have to be strong from the getgo to make them good. Id rather watch an actor hide in fear at the start and then become a confident, badass who could conquer the world later on. Do research Hollywood, its called character development. Or more specifically its dynamic characters vs static characters.",2017-12-29T19:44:38.000Z,0

I hate the fact that there is no Jonha, no Sam, no Reyes, no Grimaldi, no Alex and no Roth. Only 2 characters are there from the actual game and comic. Also, in the game and comic Lara's father is made to look like a suicide when she's 7 years old. She also doesn't know anything about Trinity until ROTR. This version of Lara is also not at all athletic looking like Lara Croft actually is. She doesn't look to have the stamina or strength Lara has to have to defeat a island of over zealous religious psychos. Of course, that might not even be the case in this movie as much as it's changed. For some reason it looks like Mathias is the head of Trinity? What is happening here? What about Himiko? There HAS to be a Sun Queen, and if there is a Sun Queen then Sam has to be in the movie. What is happening? Why did they butcher this story?!",2017-12-20T05:16:15.000Z,0

--
 Lara Croft, the fiercely independent daughter of a missing adventurer, must push herself beyond her limits when she finds herself on the island where her father disappeared.
 
From Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, Tomb Raider is the story that will set a young and resolute Lara Croft on a path toward becoming a global hero.  The film stars Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina, The Danish Girl) in the lead role, under the direction of Roar Uthaug (The Wave), with Oscar-winner Graham King (The Departed) producing under his GK Films banner.  The film¬πs production begins on the heels of the 20th anniversary of the wildly popular videogame franchise from Square Enix, Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal.

Tomb Raider also stars Dominic West (Money Monster, 300), Walton Goggins (The Hateful Eight, Django Unchained) and Daniel Wu (AMC¬πs Into the Badlands).

Now a days, movies (especially from fucking hollywood), i am NOT impressed in the slightest. Now when a movie is first announced in trailer form, usually, the trailer can explain how a movie is COMPLETELY going to play out. And as far as im looking at? This trailer for tomb raider is utterly- unsurprisingly- TRASH. mark my words... i FIRMLY belive this movie, when it comes out, will suck, like the new assassins creed movie. Because ya know, all game related movies suck right? I could be wrong, or i could be proven right. Either way, ill pass. Im not falling for this hollywood bullshit.",2017-10-08T05:04:15.000Z,0

And if you think the film wont be good, and the actress isnt, then go and become a director and do your own movie. Just deal with it, they already filmed the movie and it will premiere in March.

I'll spit it out here:
She is not fierce enough.

With the rebooted Lara, she is a young woman in a journey of solving her obsession: her father. She is still the green and terribly smart Lara with high survival instinct but still preserving her fear in most actions. The actress just can't captured that aspects, from what portrayed in this trailer anyway.

Still will watch it though.",2017-10-07T14:28:54.000Z,0

Lara was freaking scared and she evolved in time. She went through so much of pain before she actually got strong. She needs to  be seen as vulnerable first. Alicia is a splendid actress but IMO, she doesn't fit to play as Lara because she looks so darn serious. The Lara Croft i was hoping for was a curious openminded and innocent adolescent.

Especially in ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"", when i completed it i felt a great connection with the story line and the characters, the tasks were just hard enough to merit a feeling of accomplishment. That being said, video game reboots flounder the most because the whole point of a video game is self immersion and choice making... This looks entertaining but it looks like we are just watching a play through of the most recent two games. The story has so much potential and the voice acting in the game was surprisingly well done. I would recommend anyone with 10 dollars and a decent computer to play Rise of the Tomb Raider now while its less than 10 dollars on steam, just to get a little more immersed in the story line.",2017-10-05T22:11:59.000Z,0

She was always skinny and very agile. A lot of trailers do not throw in the best parts of the movie. Why would anyone wanna watch a movie when the best parts have already been shown?  The actress looks pretty accurate to the video games typical Lara Croft. You are all being shallow when it comes to tits. In Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara is very petite and her tits are average size. This by far looks more interesting and better then the original movies which did not remotely highlight Laras ability to climb and dodge as well as she can in the games.

I had high hopes for the franchise after Underworld but after Square Enix took over the franchise feels like it lost its heart and soul.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,Okay time to make an actual contribution here... When I saw a picture of the new tomb raider movie with Lara in her tank top and pick axe my entitial thoughts were oh cool maybe this will be good because they seem to understand that the rebooted game did super well and that they should have the same focus. However after seeing more from the trailer it looks like they don't understand why the game did so well because it has none of the meat and just the bare bones. They reduce all of the key characters from the game like Lara's mentor to one character who will likely be a love interest. Boo. The games did so well because of the story not purely because of the action which they seemed to fall back on yet again. Next time you make another game movie or reboot of something popular try doing some damn research into what made it so popular. Find some fans and ask them instead of presuming you understand when you don't. At best chances are that this will be just an okay movie but a giant missed opportunity because of people who can't relate to the fan base.,2017-09-27T15:51:12.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Well, as a big fan of the Tomb Raider series (both games and movies) I'd say this is mediocre. We all knew Angelina wouldn't play Lara again because she got older, and directors won't cast her again. 
I mean, I grew up on her movies, and Tomb Raider was the one that left the most impact and influence on me. Now let me tell you why. 

Lara Croft is a person that every female should look up to. She's independent, strong, fearless, smart, extremely attractive and capable. We've seen her fighting demi-gods, animals, humans, robots etc. We've seen her driving all sorts of vehicles. We've seen her solving every problem she got caught up in. Well, at least judging by all games I've played. I think Angelina was the perfect choice for Lara's character. She completely nailed her personality and she trained for months to get her physique. That's why audience LOVED Angelina, for completely taking down her character. 

That's the Lara Croft we expect this actress to portray. 

Sadly, I think that producers focused on the game that came out couple years ago, the only Tomb Raider game I disliked. Because it shows Lara before she became badass. She was trapped on that island, fighting for her dear life. It was cringe worthy for me to play the game, it's not the Lara I was used to. So making a movie based on that plot is just going to be bad. Everyone is used to Lara the way she was back when Angelina shot the two movies. 

I'll watch this nonetheless, but I'm ready to be disappointed. Also the main actress looks very lifeless, where are her badass facial expressions? Like, who am I watching? Lara Croft or some random scared chick? üòß",2017-09-27T14:55:26.000Z,1

its just another action movie trying to over cap on the success of the games and that makes me sad to think that they dont have enough materiel to make another rotr game. 

sorry that isnt lara croft. tomb raider 2 was the first game i played through and through then #1 
i wouldnt follow this lara into combat and that was an aspect of her character not only a bad ass but beautiful and confidant and i also understand this goes along with the remake of the story but seriously this actor isnt going to change into the lara of well the past or her future. 

i am pissed that we have to w8 for #3 to be made because they are wasting there time on this shit. this isnt ff7 and certainly isnt for the gamers, they got it right with ff7 ac because its a movie made from a game for the gamers. if i try to show anyone ff7 ac they just dont understand and thats what makes it perfect.

you will never make a good movie adapted from a game if it isnt for the gamers. make an action movie for the film buffs and keep making great games or at least trying",2017-09-27T11:05:39.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"wow...what a disaster of a movie this one ""looks"" like from the trailer. I hope it is a crappy trailer and not crappy movie? There is no point in saying ""don't compare it to prev movies or her to AJ"". Its human nature...its going to happen, deal with it. If you do a reboot, you should know that going in. 

The action shots IN THE TRAILER look crappy, the cast looks unfamiliar as well. AV also looks more like a tourist lost in jungle trying to survive instead of badass treasure hunter. The movie itself better have amazing action sequences otherwise this will be a waste of time.

Can't believe they didn't do simplest of things correctly. Could have gone with better clothes, heck better make up. How can you not have black eyeliner to make her look a bit more amazonian? 

Alicia Vikander is a great actress but not sure if she can fit in to Lara Croft character. She was amazing in latest Jason Bourne movie but this... Sophia Butella, Adrianne Palicki, Chloe Benette, Gina Carrano.....all better options as Lara Croft. AV's voice is also not suitable for this role. The prob we all have is that we have been spoilt by AJ playing the role previously which was right on the mark so to follow her was gonna be a tough act.",2017-09-27T09:14:07.000Z,0

Lara was meant to be brave but she's a human too. C'mon guys. I like tits too but let's not make it all about that. It's a movie and its not like you're gunna see them anyway.

I mean even the 35 year olds look like kids (Valerian, et al). My only other grievance with this is that it seems to be making the same mistake as other movies based on video games... they're trying to be just like the game. Game mechanics are fun to play, less fun to watch. Watching requires a rock solid story, something else the Croft games have.

I'll be skipping this in the cinema for sure - but how about we at least get a Blu-Ray feature that blurs out her face, and has Camilla dub the lines over, throughout the movie? Then I might give it a whirl. I can get past her body not matching that of Lara; but her face being so utterly off, and her attempt at not sounding like Lara, I cannot ignore. As a big Tomb Raider fan I truly wanted this to be good. As a fanboy I would even be willing to put up with a lot of shit like a bad script and cringy directing. I was not prepared for this let down.

WB, this is not how we win friends on the internet.)

PS: and aside from the crude elements in the comments below, this really is a bad casting choice.

Comet i-son had been come out.
it had gone to the sun.

 It is announced Comet i-son is killed in many institutes.
 But it is said i-son is live now.
and it is coming to the obit of the earth.
It has a debris of rock.
 Astronomer say,it will be passing by the earth.
I-son is coming to earth by unknown speed.

  A old famous astronomer said if it is true that the monster comet is coming to the earth, all of thing that we can do is only prayer.
The earth may be broken, because of debris of rock.
Someone say it is the day of disaster in BiBLE

Nobody know what it did for other stars and the Sun.
We don't know what accident could happen coming next day.

If God drop the diaster or we want God to defend the diaster,
We must throw the evil(killing an embryo
, a abortion, fighting ,battle, war, violence ,

killing a fertilized egg(an embryo egg=before implantation to womb) by Loop and mirena,implanon,emergency contraceptive,
long taking a general oral contraceptive pill)
 

Please Stop all of evil of nation just now by announcing of emergency situation of stopping a abortion and a killing a fertilized egg from this........

This is under.....



I'm one that in anxious about evil thing

emergency contraceptive pill is murder medicine.
loop and all of device in womb is murder device.
That pilland device have a high failure rates(implantation can be, so pregnancy can be)
When is pregnant, birth the important yourself baby certainly through single mother care center and bring up or adopt
Never kill the important yourself baby!
Who kills the own baby!!!


An embryo is a human.
A fertilized egg(an embryo bud=before implantation to womb) is a human.
The other name of a fertilized egg (an embryo bud=before implantation to womb) is a fertilized child.

An embryo of rape must be birthed.
An embryo of deformed must be birthed.
It is innocence
Don't kill it

Emergency contraceptive pill disturb the implantation to womb of a fertilized egg.
Loop and all of device in womb disturb the implantation to womb of a fertilized egg.

Long taking an general oral contraceptive pill could disturb the implantation to womb of a fertilized egg.
Of course, not disturbing the implantation is.in that time pregnancy could be.
---> about this , look: http://www.prolife.com and Read all of writings certainly)

After only taking above six months Apporoximately, an general oral contraceptive pill have a effect(stopping ovulation)
Apporoximately ,when taking over three years,by increased dosage, an general oral contraceptive pill could disturb the implantation to womb of a fertilized egg.
and an general oral contraceptive pill have a high failure rates(ovulation can be so pregnancy can be)

When being pregnant, birth the important yourself baby certainly through single mother care center and bring up or adopt
Never kill the important yourself baby!
Who kills the own baby!!!

among the six months and three years in taking of an general oral contraceptive pill,
NO ability of disturbing the implantation to womb of a fertilized egg don't be proved.
I warn intake prohibition all kind of an general oral contraceptive pill to you

Thus. the best policy of contraception is using the natural cycle of ovulation monthly of womb in long time of the abstinence and moderation from front and rear of ovulation cycle.

but, one that don't keep the abstinence and moderation must use the ""condom"" in last policy.

it is said Condom have a wrong in artipicial participation of birth of life and flowing the semen(thus. use it carefully,it must be used(put) before insertion and
Don't put off among the coitus, about this , look: http://www.prolife.com and Read all of writings certainly)

Thus, the best policy is using the natural cycle of ovulation monthly of womb in long time of the abstinence and moderation from front and rear of ovulation cycle.



Disorder of sexual life is devil life.
 Never do it.
 Never watch the obscence piture,video,lechery in internet, in Youtube, in facebook.

That behavior must be punished eternally in the hell.
Stop now! All of man and woman in adultery must live like monk and non without adultery and sex,

Peoples and children in the world are being killed of starvation every per three seconds.
We have to help them by donation.
Onlooking of starvation is devil behavior.
Onlooking must be punished in eternal time in the hell.
If we don't want to go to the hell, we must give the food,drug to them.
Right now without putting off, Let's donate through the donation company.



We have to donate for the starvation to stop malaria,to help painful child.

Ater doing this(self-examination, We have to hope the mercy of God about comet i- son(coming to earth now ) and what diaster it could happen in coming next day

It is order.

When  she does the stunts it looks more like she's running from something and has no choice rather than facing the danger head on. When it comes to sexuality, I suppose you expect the fiery character to translate into that in some way, and it has nothing to do with 'tits' and 'butts'. Also, in the scene where she's picking a gun the mannerisms seem really fake when she's trying to look cocky. I honestly think Jennifer Lawrence could do a better part here, let alone Charlize Theron. Alicia is just the wrong temperament no matter how much training hours she'd spend.",2017-09-24T15:59:42.000Z,0

Takes away from who Lara is, she was a normal girl who found her self in a very bad spot and dug deep pushing beyond her limits. Now the muscle can help me actually see her being able to do all this, but being ripped takes away from her digging deep, like Lara had to do. The fact she use to watch other people play tells me she doesn't fully know the character. But no real risk of overplaying her part. The save the world plot that was over done and was so bad that any shitty spy kids movie would know not to touch that again. The scenes here that are taken from the game, might harm it. Some things are just best left in video games, because seeing them play out rather then being a part of it are way different. This just feels like a cash grab, that no one will enjoy aside from little kids and feminist, sjw's. All that said if I see enough evidence to hint other wise I will see this.

No, she is not untalented. She has won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in The Danish Girl and she was absolutely amazing in Ex Machina.
No, her boobs aren't too small. Tits don't help you run, or jump, or solve puzzles. Tom Holland didn't fill out the crotch of his Spiderman suit. Did anyone complain? Men still thinking this need to be redirect to Pornhub.
No, she is not too small, or too ripped. Watch videos of her working out and TELL ME she doesn't look badass.
No, she is not too young. She is 28.

This whole cliche 'Please save the world for me, Laura... I'm a bit too dead right now to do it myself'.. comes off as yawn inducing, cookie cutter, action movie crap. That's NOT what the Tomb Raider franchise is today (the game franchise) or what it ever really was in the past (pre-reboot). 
The actress is good, but really not particularly good for this role. It seems the producers were trying to play identity politics again by using an actress who can make Laura look non-white, yet still retain her original British ancestry from the games.
Typical sjw stupidity that only serves to add ruin to every movie they do this to.

I grew up playing the Tomb Raider games and nothing against the actress, she is very pretty, but she does not suit the role. The only thing I liked about her was the voice. I feel like Lara's face had drastically changed in the past years and this just throws it off even more. I heard someone say they should have chose a cross fit woman or someone who has a comparable physic to the actual character and I completely agree. Lara is not just a voice, she is the body, voice, attitude, etc which I feel was not represented. Other than that, parts looked extremely cheesy and too posed along with the dialogue as people were saying. Hopefully they'll do better in the future",2017-09-23T16:41:41.000Z,0

Secondly, wtf has been size got to do with how well someone can play Lara Croft? Game accuracy? You do realize in the early games her boobs were like arrow heads and to make them true to life you'd have to almost be able to cut glass with them. Or did you want her to look like she accidentally wandered on set from the Lego Movie? Lastly, there is nothing wrong with the casting. She looks the part, has the accent down and tbh it's unfair not to give her a chance before actually seeing how well she does in the movie. This could be awesome. We don't know. It at least looks like it's trying to follow the 2013 remake in some way (though I know it won't be completely the same), which is better than what they have done in the past.

I'm excited to see Alicia Vikander play her! Besides, it's Lara's beginning. Her upper half probably won't grow in until later.

Also, c'mon let's be realistic. I'm sure big boobs wouldn't be on the plus side if you are running away from wild animals, a sinking ship and bad guys.

I grew up with classic badass Lara so the sensitive shit bothers me and the over all revamp of the story about her I've always known. why not keep her story and revamp her look and add emotions to her old character? but I guess because she was dying out with the newer generation, they felt they had no choice. personally, this movie seems good but I will never claim her as a croft, I will only call her Lara. she is no croft. the movie itself seems like it may be ok, but again, I grew up with the classics so I prefer the legendary Angelina Jolie forever, she's a better actress and played her role well. who is to say though that this girl does fit the NEW character Lara, although, she doesn't have the same emotions as the new Lara and her story is seeming to change as well in the movie. just remember people, it can't be perfect and they can only do so much with a movie.",2017-09-22T06:39:49.000Z,0

The whole point of the newer Tomb Raider games (which this looks to be based off of) is that Lara finds inner strength to continue on.  Sure, she knows how to shoot guns and stuff, but she doesn't go to the island expecting to use any, and her first time killing someone comes as quite a shock to her.  She shouldn't be billy bad ass at the beginning of the movie, but instead be an intelligent, normal young woman.  This is all speculation at this point, but the trailer, rather than encouraging me to see the movie, actually discourages me from watching it.",2017-09-22T06:06:48.000Z,16

It looks just like the game, but.. not. You'd think that'd be good, but it isn't. Looks boring. Should have just went with Uncharted, it was more than gameplay. It had good gameplay, voice actors, action, characters and chemistry. Nathan is a character I can like, and want to live. He's witty and likable, Lara, not so much. Tomb raider is just a game, and that will not translate well, especially with this robot. She looks like she's still playing one in EX machina. Lara Croft was mans character, that was her audience. The action, the body, and that was it. I can see they wanted more, and for her to be real by getting rid of the invincible and sexy babe aspect, but it still feels fake and not authentic.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Whats the point of creating a movie based off a game which was already extremely cinematic? I dont understand how they are trying to mix ""Badass"" 90's Laura with ""Human"" and ""Vulnerable"" modern Laura. You cant combine them because theyre both complete opposites with no middle ground. When I see this trailer I see elements of a Laura that is trying to find her start but when it comes to the action and danger she isn't scared. She's focused and tactile which is not modern Laura but classic Laura. There is no sense of urgency when the heroine literally can do anything. In the Tomb Raider reboot a lot of the victories were due to pure luck. That's what made it seem so real because Laura was constantly scared and surviving instead of being monotoned and thriving.",2017-09-22T05:01:03.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"To be brutally honest (please dont kill me) I like Alicia Vikander, but I dont like her as Lara Croft. I feel Camilla Luddington would've been a better choice. She is Lara's actor in the recent videogames. Her face (mocap), body, and voice are Lara and a large part of what made the recent video games great is what Camilla brought to the table and made her version of Lara such a likable character. I mean she acted her out already for the games why couldnt they just get her. Also dont hurt me for saying this but Alicia just looks like she's doing a really bad cosplay of Lara.¬†

Also this is just my bias but she's not that beautiful for Lara in my opinion. I'm not asking for busty oversexualized triangle tits Lara I'm just asking for someone more prettier (dont hurt me please). Alicia to me just reminds me of like somene's sister. When i visualize her i picture someone like Camilla for the newer younger Lara, but if it was older Lara like in the old games, I would've casted Kate Beckingsale.",2017-09-22T00:48:02.000Z,0

The whole trailer seemed like everyone spoke in excruciatingly bad one-liners, the special effects looked laughable, and the whole plot seems painfully predictable. Love the games and the character, but if the previous two movies have taught us anything, it's that Lara Croft should stay within the realms of video games.
Hopefully I'm wrong and this movie will wind up being a hit. I mean, at least the casting is decent (Alicia Vikander & Walter Goggins are excellent casting choices). I suppose only time will tell.",2017-09-21T23:42:32.000Z,4

I don't see the problem with the trailer at all so why the hate? Half of the people complaining about ""no boobs"" which is a stupid thing to complain about. Also, as much as I like the character in movie to resemble the game one I think for movies you need talent over appearance. Nobody said shit when Peter Dinklage played bolivar trask in the xmen movie, mostly because he did a great job with the role. So why not give this movie the benefit of the doubt for now? While the trinity storyline is not the one I would have started with at least it looks like they are trying to be a bit more faithful to the game (well, the reboot) so that is always a step in the right direction.

#1 thing i don't like is that she looks BARELY anything like her AND she barely sound British in some scenes 

#2 the Costumes look like it was just some Halloween Getup or Cosplay, it looks too Fake imo

#3 ...really....the ''ill have 2'' part when she holds up two guns? in the 2013 Tomb raider Lara was this petite little girl wanting adventure, and this basically shows ""BLOOD! FIGHTING!! BOWS!! PUZZLES!! GUNS!!!"" i want my Little Petite Lara back from the game.

#4 some of the actors are cringy, (not Alicia Vikander tho shes just cute) but the new ones are just weird...

She doesn't need to have fucking tits and turn guys on during the movie, so complaining about that for something other than a joke/nostalgia is perverted.
And yeah, she doesn't _look_ like Lara Croft, but hell if I'm not gonna go see this movie. Besides, you guys are being such asses to her- she is not ugly. If THAT'S ugly, then I'd have to imagine half of the people on earth are grotesque to you people :/

Doesn't matter if she doesn't have the video-game body that Lara has it's a movie perspective. Big breasts and hips only get in the way for the stunts IRL. She's actually a slim fit woman which is pretty attractive by itself instead of being overly bulky. Yes, trailer shows a lot.. but I played the games and it just traced over what all us gamers know about Lara. We won't know til it comes out. Seriously, if you can find a woman with big tits and hips that is fit enough to do the stunts like Lara.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Am I the only one that sees this as a movie of the NEW Tomb Raider Lara Croft?  As in the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot game by Crystal Dynamics simply named ""Tomb Raider"".  To me this isn't the fully mature adult Lara, this is the archaeological student who was raised as a survivalist that begins taking after her father in examining such dangerous and powerful things that eventually leads her to become the legend.  Hell, the trailer even says ""HER LEGEND BEGINS"".  It also references an island in some dangerous zone(the Devil's Sea here whereas in the game it was called the Dragon's Triangle) where she gets shipwrecked and taken prisoner by the locals.  It seems to blend the first reboot and its sequel ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"" because the villain is an organization known as ""Trinity"" which is the primary antagonist of said game.   To me, Alicia Vikander pulls of that depiction of Lara wonderfully.  I'm excited for this movie, but apprehensive, as a lot of video game movies are garbage.  Here's hoping this one breaks the mold.",2017-09-21T20:55:03.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"So... Let me get this straight. People in here aren't complaining about the quality of the trailer, or the story... But about her TITS??? What the hell is wrong with you? Here you have a trailer about a movie with decent cinematography, decent pre-production effects and an Oscar-Nominated actress, yet all you can point out is the bust size?

Newsflash: Women in real life do not have big busts like Mary Jane Watson/Sue Storm/Lara Croft. Maybe Hollywood was more interested in someone who could actually emote and give you a decent performance. Sure, the plot looks a bit thin, but the games were like that too. As long the main characters are great (one of them is being played by Walton Goggins, come on), the movie will be fine.

THIS is why we never get good video game adaptations. Because we complain about useless stuff and because we have the maturity of a 13 year old kid. No wonder studio executives do not take us seriously.",2017-09-21T20:13:48.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"I will just put here comment of Gergely Gyurics becouse i think he  gets the main problem of this movie but its lost in answers of the other comment.

Actually it is nothing like the reboot game, that they promised. In the Square-Enix 2013 Tomb Raider Lara was not an action hero, nor a genious. She was a smart girl well versed in history and survival craft, but apart from that, she had a normal, real, actually relatable human psyche. She was afraid of going through wrecks over waterfalls, she had to talk to herself to calm down, she cried because of stress. Here, she is showed as the oldschool genious action hero she was in the Angelina Jolie movies, making hero poses with pistols and solving age old mysteries during her onboarding sessions.

It just... losts the whole birth of a hero feeling. Lara in the game was NOT ready. She had to constantly search and find new sources of inner strength, she had to face situations, where your only choices where terrible and dangerous, and had to grow up to it before your very eyes. You could see her in a situation where you know you WOULD have given up, because you could not do it, but she had no choice! Now she just goes in to kick ass while being sexy. And while that is fun to an extent - like for five minutes -, it does'nt make a good plot.

The story lost the... actually, what it lost was the story. From the trailer it looks just a sequence of poses, action and clich√© dialogues.",2017-09-21T17:24:12.000Z,0

The Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector

To some who were confident of their own 
righteousness and 
looked down on everyone else, 
Jesus told this parable:

‚ÄúTwo men went up to the temple to pray, one a 
Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 
The Pharisee stood 
by himself and prayed: ‚ÄòGod, I thank you 
that I am not like
 other people‚Äîrobbers, evildoers, 
adulterers‚Äîor even like
 this tax collector. I fast twice a week 
and give a tenth of all I get.‚Äô

‚ÄúBut the tax collector stood at a distance. 
He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his 
breast and said, ‚ÄòGod, have mercy on me, a sinner.‚Äô

‚ÄúI tell you that this man, rather than the other, 
went home justified before God. For all those who 
exalt themselves will be humbled, and those 
who humble themselves will be exalted.‚Äù",2017-09-21T16:17:12.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Matthew 24

The Destruction of the Temple and Signs of
the End Times

Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his
disciples came up to him to call his attention 
to its buildings.‚ÄúDo you see all these things?‚Äù
he asked. ‚ÄúTruly I tell you, not one stone here
will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.‚Äù

As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, 
the disciples came to him privately. ‚ÄúTell us,‚Äù
they said, ‚Äúwhen will this happen, and what 
will be the sign of your coming and of the end 
of the age?‚Äù

Jesus answered: ‚ÄúWatch out that no one deceives 
you.For many will come in my name, claiming, ‚ÄòI am
the Messiah,‚Äô and will deceive many.You will
hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it 
that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen,
but the end is still to come. Nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
All these are the beginning of birth pains.

‚ÄúThen you will be handed over to be persecuted and put
to death, and you will be hated by all nations because
of me. At that time many will turn away from the faith
and will betray and hate each other, and many false
prophets will appear and deceive many people.
Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of
most will grow cold,  but the one who stands firm to
the end will be saved.  And this gospel of the kingdom
will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to 
all nations, and then the end will come.

‚ÄúSo when you see standing in the holy place ‚Äòthe 
abomination that causes desolation,‚Äô spoken of through
the prophet Daniel‚Äîlet the reader understand‚Äî 
then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 
Let no one on the housetop go down to take anything out
of the house. Let no one in the field go back to
get their cloak. How dreadful it will be in 
those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers!
Pray that your flight will not take place in winter
or on the Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great
distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world
until now‚Äîand never to be equaled again.

‚ÄúIf those days had not been cut short, no one would
survive, but for the sake of the elect those days
will be shortened. At that time if anyone says
to you, ‚ÄòLook, here is the Messiah!‚Äô or, ‚ÄòThere he is!‚Äô
do not believe it.  For false messiahs and false
prophets will appear and perform great signs and wonders
to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See,
I have told you ahead of time.

‚ÄúSo if anyone tells you, ‚ÄòThere he is, out in the wilderness,‚Äô
do not go out; or, ‚ÄòHere he is, in the inner rooms,‚Äô do not 
believe it.For as lightning that comes from the east is
visible even in the west, so will be the coming of the 
Son of Man.  Wherever there is a carcass, 
there the vultures will gather.

‚ÄúImmediately after the distress of those days

‚Äú‚Äòthe sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not give its light;
the stars will fall from the sky,
and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.‚Äô

‚ÄúThen will appear the sign of the Son of Man in 
heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn
 when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of 
heaven, with power and great glory. And he will
 send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will
 gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of
 the heavens to the other.

‚ÄúNow learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon
as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out,
you know that summer is near. Even so, when
you see all these things, you know that it is near, right
 at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will
 certainly not pass away until all these things have
 happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, 
but my words will never pass away.

The Day and Hour Unknown

‚ÄúBut about that day or hour no one knows, not even
the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.
As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the
coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before
the flood, people were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day
Noah entered the ark; 39 and they knew nothing
about what would happen until the flood came
and took them all away. That is how it wil be 
at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in
the field; one will be taken and the other left.
Two women will be grinding with a hand mill; 
one will be taken and the other left.

‚ÄúTherefore keep watch, because you do not know
on what day your Lord will come. But understand this:
If the owner of the house had known at what time of
night the thief was coming, he would have kept watch
and would not have let his house be broken into. 
So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man
will come at an hour when you do not expect him.

‚ÄúWho then is the faithful and wise servant, 
whom the master has put in charge of the servants
in his household to give them their food at 
the proper time? It will be good for that
servant whose master finds him doing so when he 
returns. Truly I tell you, he will put him in charge
of all his possessions.But suppose that servant
is wicked and says to himself, ‚ÄòMy master is staying
away a long time,‚Äô and he then begins to beat his 
fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards.
The master of that servant will come on a day when 
he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware
of.He will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with
the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and
gnashing of teeth.

So then, this is 
how you should pray:

‚ÄòOur Father in heaven,
hallowed be Your name,
Your kingdom come,
Your will be done,
on earth as it is in 
heaven.
Give us this day our daily 
bread,
And forgive us our debts,
as we also have forgiven 
our debtors;
And lead us not into 
temptation,
but deliver us from 
the evil one.

For if you forgive men their 
trespasses, your
Heavenly Father will also
forgive you. 
But if you do not forgive men their 
trespasses, neither will your

Sermon on the Mount
Jesus:
‚ÄúBlessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are those who mourn,
for they will be comforted.

Blessed are the meek,
for they will inherit the earth.

Blessed are those who hunger and 
thirst for righteousness,
for they will be filled.

Blessed are the merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.

Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they will see God.

Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they will be called children of God.

Blessed are those who are persecuted 
because of righteousness,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

‚ÄúBlessed are you when people insult you,
persecute you and falsely
say all kinds of evil against you because
of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great 
is your reward in heaven, for in the same 
way they persecuted the prophets who 
were before you.

Matthew 5:13-16

Salt and Light
‚ÄúYou are the salt of the earth. But if the salt 
loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty 
again? It is no longer good for anything, 
except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.


‚ÄúYou are the light of the world. A town 
built on a hill cannot be hidden. 
Neither do people light a lamp and put it 
under
a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, 
and it gives light to everyone in the house. 
In the same way, let your light shine before
others, that they may see your good deeds
and glorify your Father in heaven.

Matthew5:17-20-47

The Fulfillment of the Law
‚ÄúDo not think that I have come to abolish the Law
or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but
to fulfill them. 18 For truly I tell you, until
heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest 
letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will
by any means disappear from the Law until 
everything is accomplished. Therefore 
anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands
and teaches others accordingly will be called least in
the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and 
teaches these commands will be called great in 
the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless
your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees
and the teachers of the law, you will certainly 
not enter the kingdom of heaven.

Murder
‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 
‚ÄòYou shall not murder,
and anyone who murders will be
subject to judgment.‚Äô
But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother
or sister
will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to
a brother or sister, ‚ÄòRaca,‚Äô is answerable to the
court. And anyone who says, ‚ÄòYou fool!‚Äô will be in
danger of the fire of hell.

‚ÄúTherefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar
and there remember that your brother or sister has
something against you, leave your gift there in
front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them;
 then come and offer your gift.

‚ÄúSettle matters quickly with your adversary who
is taking you to court. Do it while you are
still together on the way, or your adversary
may hand you over to the judge, and the judge
may hand you over to the officer, and you may
be thrown into prison. 26 Truly I tell you, you
will not get out until you have paid the last penny.

Adultery
‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòYou shall not commit 
adultery.
But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully 
has already
committed adultery with her in his heart. If your 
right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and 
throw it away. It is better for you to lose one 
part of your body than for your whole body to be 
thrown into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes
 you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. 
It is better for you to lose one part of your 
body than for your whole body to go into hell.

Divorce
‚ÄúIt has been said, ‚ÄòAnyone who divorces his 
wife must give her a certificate of divorce.‚Äô 
But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife,
except for sexual immorality, makes her the victim of adultery,
 and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery.

Oaths
‚ÄúAgain, you have heard that it was said to the people long ago,
‚ÄòDo not break your oath, but fulfill to the Lord the vows you
have made.‚Äô But I tell you, do not swear an oath at all:
either by heaven, for it is God‚Äôs throne;or by the earth,
for it is his footstool; or by Jerusalem, for it is the city
of the Great King. 36 And do not swear by your head, for you
cannot make even one hair white or black. All you need to say
is simply ‚ÄòYes‚Äô or ‚ÄòNo‚Äô; anything beyond this comes from the
evil one.


Eye for Eye
‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòEye for eye, and tooth for
tooth.‚Äô But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.
If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the
other cheek also. 40 And if anyone wants to sue you and
take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. 
If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with
them two miles.Give to the one who asks
you, and do not turn away from the one who 
wants to borrow from you.

Love for Enemies
‚ÄúYou have heard that it was said, ‚ÄòLove your neighborand
 hate your enemy.‚Äô
But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who
persecute you, that you may be children of your Father
in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and 
the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.
If you love those who love you, what reward will you 
get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you 
greet only your own people, what are you doing more than 
others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, 
therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.",2017-09-21T16:14:33.000Z,0
2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"2 Chronicles 7:14

If my people, who are called by my name, will 
humble themselves and pray and seek my face and 
turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear 
from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and
will heal their land.

EZEKIEL 18:24-31
‚ÄúBut if a righteous person turns
from their righteousness and commits
sin and does the same detestable things
the wicked person does, will they live?
None of the righteous things that person
has done will be remembered. Because of
the unfaithfulness they are guilty of 
and because of the sins they have committed,
they will die.
‚ÄúYet you say, ‚ÄòThe way of the Lord is not
just.‚Äô Hear, you Israelites: Is my way unjust?
Is it not your ways that are unjust? If a
righteous person turns from their righteousness
and commits sin, they will die for it; because
of the sin they have committed they will die.
But if a wicked person turns away from the 
wickedness they have committed and does what
is just and right, they will save their life.
Because they consider all the offenses they have
committed and turn away from them, that person 
will surely live; they will not die.  Yet the
Israelites say, ‚ÄòThe way of the Lord is not just.‚Äô
Are my ways unjust, people of Israel? Is it not
your ways that are unjust?
‚ÄúTherefore, you Israelites, I will judge each 
of you according to your own ways, declares the 
Sovereign Lord. Repent! Turn away from all your
offenses; then sin will not be your downfall.
Rid yourselves of all the offenses you 
have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit.
Why will you die, people of Israel?  
For I take no pleasure in the death of
anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. 
Repent and live!

And from the people saying that, ""the movie gives you the lara you wanted"", yes it did gave us the lara we wanted... during the 90's and from the earlier movie versions of her, what we want now is a version of the character that reflects the growth of the industry and be the version that the reboot has done right.",2017-09-21T15:06:09.000Z,0

They have literally cobbled together scenes from the 2 Jolie movies and tried to re-invent the wheel. And what happened to Lara Croft's boobs and bodacious body? I say this as a woman - who's not a lesbian! That was part of the charm of the original movies. That a woman that gorgeous could be so badass. Now Lara Croft looks like a 14 year-old girl. I will give Vikander this though - her British accent is equally as bad as Jolie's was. Otherwise - I'll pass. She's not believable as an action hero and I really can't get over the fact that she looks like a teenager girl and the characters supposed to be 21 and she's 27 in real life.

(I.S.o.B.P. - International School of Biblical Prophecy - Youtube.com/ISOBP )

Accept This Gift: Pray to Jesus and Ask for Your sins to be Covered then Seek Water Baptism.

GOD LOVES YOU. However, God does not Condone your sins. ‚ÄúGood‚Äù people Have Committed Sins as well. As You have not lived a Perfect life. Nor has Anyone else. Your sins have Made you a Sinner before God. The Penalty for Your sins is the Curse of Death.
However there Is Good news: Someone who never Committed a sin, Can be Your Substitution, such a Person May Carry Your Judgment for Your sins, In Your place.
God‚Äôs Love for You Inspired Him to send His son, Who‚Äôs capable of Living a Life Without Sin, and made him undergo the curse of Death in your place.
This is How Eternal Life becomes Accessible to you. As Jesus, Gods son, Never Committed A sin during His Earthly Life, so By the Law of Sin and Death, God was obligated to resurrect Him, Rightfully, as that Law Only Applies to Sinners.
Eternal life Cannot be Obtained by means of Money, Nor is there a way to ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù the right that God Pardons you from the Curse of Death with your Own Efforts of Recompense for Your Sins. You are unable to ‚ÄúDeserve‚Äù it, It‚Äôs a Gift from God.
Its Up to You to Choose if you Accept this Gift, and When You do so, God Arranged the Forgiveness of your sins and Will Choose to Forget that You ever Committed Them.
Those Who Accept this Gift will Become Sons and Daughters of God, and No Longer be Separated From Him. Such will Receive Access to the Holy Spirit and Will Dwell in Heaven with God in the Afterlife.
After your reunition with GOD, the Holy Spirit Will Help You To Not Return to that old Lifestyle of Committing Sins, Lest You Become Separated from God Again, Nor should You Desire To Be found Abusing God‚Äô Grace Upon You.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"The trailer looks bomb! 

Few things from me though,

I hope we get to see more of the emotional side of Lara, so we can empathize with her character even more. That was a huge theme of the first game too, to humanize her. If she gets too bad ass (even though it's awesome) most of the audience wouldn't even flinch everytime she get's hurt or in a pickle situation. This is just a trailer so I'm not too worried.

I also don't like how they just narrates what lara supposed to do from what it seems like in this trailer. In the game she was never litteraly told by her father to ""destroy the tomb blabla"". She was given clues and a naturally curious person, and when she finds the problem she actually learns to solve it by herself. So it almost feels like they were watering down lara's father figure to me. But I hope the actual movie is not as straight forward as I thought it would be.

I know this is the movie and that was the game and those two were completely different media of story telling, but since they were tied I thought it would make sense to point out few things that's important to the story telling aspect to me. Still excited for the movie though! I thought it was never gonna happen",2017-09-21T14:00:54.000Z,1

At least in the game Lara jumps off the sinking boat to reach the hand of a friend trying to save her. This movie she just grabs a huge ass bag and jumps into the middle of nowhere. How logical. 
And don't get me started on the jump stunts. For a movie basing itself on the more realistic latter games, she jumps abnormally high. The old Lara used to do that. I prefer the old Lara, she was incredibly smart, tougher than most men and yet more feminine than most women and feared no obstacle. The new Lara is fairly feminine, physically weaker than most men she encounters, and isn't really that clever, she just gets lucky. I really don't get how the new Lara is a statement to female rights given the old Lara was more competent. So she had huge boobs. Big deal. So sexist, right? IMO mixing old Lara with the new is simply put, Stupid. It's a cash grab to silence both fans of the old and new. But we all know how things turn out when you try to please everyone. You end up pleasing no one.",2017-09-21T13:35:06.000Z,0

She's obviously put a lot of work into this, she looks like Lara, no she is not *too sweet*. They cast her and they obviously did so for a fucking reason. There's nothing you can do about it.

Still, the characters from the game seemed to fit the situation better. They should have definitely brought in Conrad Roth, as he was a great mentor and crucial to her transformation from a college student to a relentless adventurer. He also served to pass the torch from Laura's father to Laura.

If you think it's generic and not Tomb Raider, I DARE you to watch the trailer to the Tomb Raider game reboot (2013). I pre-ordered the reboot for the PS3, and finished it. I also bought and played through the graphically enhanced PS4 version. Because of that, I remember the storyline, characters, and scenes in the game.

If I have one criticism, is that the trailer feels like a shot for shot live action translation of the game. Go and watch the trailer and try to tell me that I am wrong. At least a third of it is 100% identical to what you see in the game. 

I'm not sure how I feel about it yet, but I give them a lot of credit to sticking to the source material better than the MCU does.",2017-09-21T06:52:30.000Z,0

This looks terrible lmao I knew from the second the announced who they had cast as Lara that this was gonna be a mess. I know this is based off the reboots, but Angelina Jolie had classic Lara DOWN TO THE T. She had the face, the body, the intelligence and confidence!! That is the Lara I was hoping to see more of, not some shitty cosplay version. Plus the special effects on this film look like absolute garbage???? What the fuck. They could have stripped this down and made it super gritty, minimal cg, but instead we got this ""I'll take two"", green-screened fanservice-y piece of trash. And to top it of, her hair looks bad.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"It looks so stupid. I‚Äôm very much a fan and was excited for another movie, but when a video game seems more realistic than a life action movie I just have no interest in seeing it. It looks like it should be fanmade for YouTube rather than a box office movie.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong with this movie based off the trailer: 

1. I don‚Äôt remember precisely, but I don‚Äôt think her parents wanted her to have any part in these dangerous adventures, specifically her mother. Who also died when she was younger. 

2. The shots they tried to recreate from the game lead to her being cut and bruised, leave it to a movie adaptation to leave out all of that so the actress can remain ‚Äúpretty‚Äù.

3. The actress just doesn‚Äôt have it at all, nothing other than her being brunette and British is that of Lara.

4. The very end of the trailer was the final nail in the coffin when she looks absolutely nothing like any adaptation of Lara Croft ever.",2017-09-21T00:59:36.000Z,0

What do I want? I want a game-movie, that exceeds the very game it's based on by doing the same exact job as the newest God of War game did on its predecessors - it has a completely different story, an immensely unexpected world that it throws us into. And it's far more realistic than those basic Hollywood movies. A whole lot more expansive. Tomb Raider movie series, and all the other movies that want to blindly follow games they're based on, should listen to what I said. Or else die of natural causes, exactly as this movie will. Trust me, I write scenarios. This is pure stock-shit. I'm truly ashamed of the directors and producers.
Dude, what happened to Hollywood? Why doesn't it hire people like me anymore? Does everything have to be so void of mental nutrients and hugely caloric like a Heart Attack Grill's burger these days?",2017-09-21T00:19:19.000Z,0

I found it a bit bland and it didn't really show much of Lara. But aside from not being used to her and her face as Lara Croft, the actress fits the profil, deal with it.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Tbh better actress choice. Angelina Jolie was great for the old tomb raiders but the new tomb raiders have a younger Lara. This new actress represents Lara in the 2010-17 games better, even though it wasn't the actress I'd choose. But maybe she'd be good. Idk but you guys shouldn't be expecting Lara of the old tomb raiders but Lara of the new. The new ones have been less about lara being a hot slut with guns, and more about a survival coming of age story about a young ""strong"" British girl. Seems like they did the same with the actress. Mind you, actresses are not only chosen on looks reminiscent to the character but how they play that character. Don't think the movie will be bad because ""Alicia Vikander"" doesn't look like her. Regardless, I'd still pay $15 to see it in the movie theater, and I'm kinda hyped.",2017-09-21T03:14:55.000Z,16

But it also feels like they're doing the same they did with Baywatch. Using the name of a classic TV show/video game, as an excuse for an action movie just to make more money. For me, they've totally ruined this by casting Alicia Vikander as Lara Croat. I'm not saying she isn't a talented actress. I'm just saying she's not a good Lara Croft, and I think the problem with her is that her features aren't very feminine. Lara Croft is supposed to be a femme fatale. Elegant and badass at the same time. Curvy and delicate, but intimidating. That's why people fell in love with Angelina Jolie.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"This is not Tomb Raider this should just be called Survivor because its always about her surviving not living out to do her fathers searches or her own tomb raiding. They have changed Tomb Raider into a killer and not a Tomb Raider. Her first story when she was young in the legend game is when  she visits an island that is cursed. Basically they used that idea to start of this new remake of Tomb raider. But this is taking it too far. She doesn't even raid tombs in the games.
She just Survives. 
I like the idea but don't call it tomb raider when she doesn't even act like Lara. 
The games are fun but they should of been called something else. 
Also thumbs down on the trailer. A definite no from me.",2017-09-20T21:45:56.000Z,0

The thing that made the original game so special was the solitude and atmosphere . It was just you and lara exploring tombs with no shitty characters or dialogue. Just you and lara versus the wilds and the wildlife. Plus lara was totally kick ass with a killer ass and awesome jugs, which was nice.

Many, so called ""Tomb Raider"" says that it's terrible  because Alicia Vikander looks weak, she's not hot at all, She's a bitch because no one can touch Angelina jolie, oh I can make a better movie, a Uncharted movie will be better then this. Their all invalid points, *first* of all: you should be exicted that the reboot of Tomb Raider 2013 and Rise of the Tomb Raider is getting a movie based version, *Second*: This is a Trailer not a finished version of the movie, ""Third*: their is are no rating or reviews we have seen bassd on this movie yet, *Fourth*: don't call it terrible when it's not out yet and predict it that it will be tied up garbage, based of your though of being sexist, *Fifth*: (""I don't know why but""), we don't even have a good glimpse if Uncharted will be a good movie or even a movie at all because Sony Financially is not doing well but their Electronic Portable music and PlayStation division is doing fine, *Sixth*: if you think you can make a better movie, what's your actors and actresses, your knowledge and research on how you will do it, what locations will you use the scenes out of, how many computer you need to make the movie scenes, and what's you budget and investment in this movie because it's quite expensive You guys don't explain point you just give biased brain dead conclusion that the movies is already a dumbster fire when we don't know at all what the movie will be like until we get a full understanding once we watch. Stop lying without coming out with things you know and give a very logical valid opinion about your thoughts on this trailer, not bash it entirely from one preview trailer seriously nothing but, console peasents and retardness of their fanboys.

Father also died while hiding big secrets about humanity, ship also got wrecked and a young Lara also trapped on an island with crazy cult people, the vallian's organization's also called""Trinity"", the whole structure of the story is a little bit too similar, not only to the gamers but also to brand new audience ,the story itself is very predictable and full of ""Deja-vu"". The trailer basically already told us most of the plotline.Even Jolie's TR movies were also based on the old games,but the story themselves were built separately and they felt more refreshing .Maybe because of the reboot  games were too big a success, they are following the story a little too tightly .This whole trailer feels kinda like a fan made trailer or a cosplay show.",2017-09-20T19:33:17.000Z,0

And she fit that role well, because that robot required the actress to possess innately bland and innocent facial features. The issue here is wholly different. The problem here isn't only that women aren't good fighters, which makes female action characters inherently unbelievable, but that 99% of the actresses out there look cringey just pretending to be fighting, running and jumping. Actresses need to have a very tailored skillset/talent/personality to pull it off, like Angelina Jolie (raw/aggressive facial features), Gal Gadot (tall/ex-military), Milla Jovovich (slavic facial features/soviet vibe) etc...

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"since everyone has to hate here, let me state my opinion in a nice way: WARNING THIS IS AN OPINION
-lara croft has to be super sexy thats what the games were about, otherwise the unrealistic plot of ""the only human on the planet to safe mankind"" would be in the center of interest, which is kinda dumb
-the ecxiting part of watching/playing lara as a superhero was to see her finding a way out and turning the tables in the end whilst playing the tough girl, not the untouchable one, which her gracile way of acting in this trailer suggests
example: she pulls the arrow only halfway through, which looks unrealistic and somewhat weak, and her overall expression in combat suggests that shes playing a choreography, not playing like shes ripping through her enemies like real lara
-1:52 insert sexy moaning while jumping for your life for... reasons. no but seriously NOW they are trying put sexy lara back on the screen? wtf... 
- why is it called tomb raider when the trailer suggests its about ""lara vs a group of guys with guns while shes trying to be tomb raider""... im so sad they took out the mysteries of the japanese-styled fantasy on the islands
+i like the CGI, it doesnt look too shabby
now this sounds like hell of a trashy movie, but i have only seen the trailer yet and honestly think it should be well watchable, tho i dont know where they are trying to go with it... at first she decided to become a hero, and then they have her be as much of a ""regular"" woman as possible... these movies should be and have been about lara the sexy hero to raid tombs right?",2017-09-20T19:18:46.000Z,2

Every time we are given a trailer for a video game based film that shows potential or promise proves to be a complete disaster. Even video game that should prove the easiest to adapt to the big screen like Max Payne turn out to be steaming piles of shit. Why does Hollywood bother to continue trying to adapt games to film?

But gonna stugle to take the villain seriously sine i can't get the image of him with titts out of my head. But what i don't get is the casting... I don't mind the actress they've got in the role of Lara. Shes good. But they're taking so much from the new games. A lil taste of the classic games at the end there. But the actress playing Lara in the games is one hll of a hotie and clearly knows how to act. Why not just cast her? I allways wondered why they didn't just go that rout. She honestly looks more like a Lara to me then Alicia does.... But again, don't mind her. Shes great! But yeah. It's gonna be fun to see if this becomes another train wreck or if it'll be a passable movie. My expectations are very low. There's honestly just one video game movie i think stands any chance of being good. And that's the Metal Gear Solid movie. Mostly because the director seems to understand the source material he is working with. And his ready to break every rule in the book of film making to ensure the movie stays true to the games. But yet adding his own flavor to it all. And he seems to have Mr. Kojima's blessing so if any movie based on games is set up for success it's that.

Get real, dickheads. Even Lara's in-game boobs have been scaled down for the reboot, so the fact that the actress' ones are smaller doesn't matter. And it wouldn't have mattered anyway, you don't cast a role for boobs (unless you're Michael Bay), you cast a role for authenticity. It isn't the best trailer I've ever seen, and video game films do tend to flop, but perhaps this will turn the tide. I'm gonna go see it, and more than anything I hope to find that Vikander was cast for her ability to play a convincing Lara Croft rather than just because she's a lookalike.

Besides, who needs boobs in a film when it's got Nick Frost? I'm still looking forward to this, and if you just came here for boobs, jog on, we don't want you.",2017-09-20T17:26:37.000Z,0

It follows the current TR content/aesthetic and that's not really a bad thing in my opinion.

 I have been a tomb raider fan since day one when i installed the original Tomb Raider demo on my brand new 200 mhz Pentium pro in 1996. I really don't think Lara's breast size (however nice to look at) defines her character or the games, and if you are a TR fan just for that then you are not really a fan of the games, which would explain why so many are condemning this movie just for that fact alone, and after only one trailer.

This... Looks generic, boring, filled with bad FX, and just not good enough. Maybe I'm too old for this shit, or maybe they should have stick to their material, the grimy 2013 reboot of the series.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Part of the appeal of Tomb Raider, the games, is that you play AS Laura and are an ACTIVE participant to what she does and what happens to her. A Tomb Raider movie, on the other hand, makes you a PASSIVE participant‚Äîpretty much a prisoner to the script, dialogue and choices. 

This franchise, and any other where the original source is a video game are doomed to be crappy. I think you can make a successful game based on a movie, but not a successful movie based on a game.

A movie turned into a game EXPANDS the universe and possibilities and can provide dozens of hours of entertainment, with hundreds of choices of how the story unfolds.

A game turned into a movie CONSTRICTS the universe, diminishes possibilities and usually fails to provide the same level of entertainment because the (usually disconnected filmmakers) rush/condense/homogenize the story/characters/locations due to a usual 2-hour constraint. 

Also, because of the simple fact that REAL people need to perform UNREAL acts in UNREAL situations, usually with the heavy use of unrealistic CG, the suspension of disbelief is harder to achieve.

In other words, movies based on video games are usually going to suck.",2017-09-20T17:00:30.000Z,0

When they filmed this were all the actors told they should be as emotionless and uncommitted as humanly possible. Everyone and I mean everyone just seems to be going through the motions here. Of course it's only a trailer so who can say?! But I think we  can say lol. I really like the Tomb Raider reboots, and I think with the right filmakers, perhaps ones that actually give a *** about making something awesome out of this franchise, it could really be a fun movie. I don't know how to do Tomb Raider in a way that makes it more good than fun. It's just modern day Indiana Jones with boobs, at least I felt that way playing it as a kid. Even that is giving it too much credit somehow. But these recent games are a lot more complex. I don't think Lara is that interesting of a character, her story is told over and over with nothing really new brought to the table. Just rehash. Almost like the plot to this film (it seems) with the TOMB RAIDER game reboot. Man, it has its moments. Maybe as a TV show or something. Stop trying to do a summer blockbuster apporach, Hollywood. And maybe get an actress who can emote. This chick was just like the exact same throughout the whole trailer lol. If thats what she was going for then well done. Videogame movies still suck I guess?

Laura Croft as a character, her badassness and drive to never give up while raiding these epic Tombs continuing her fathers legacy is what inspired me as a young girl to want to kick ass. I braided my hair and wore it just like her. I wanted to explore and discover the world around me unafraid, just like her. Thats what really makes her great, not her tits or her ass.

Not saying the movie is shit, because this is just a trailer, the first one at that, HOWEVER, I do not like this trailer and it gives me the IMPRESSION that this movie will have bland dialogue, a story that was slopped together lazily, all possibly under the excuse that the source material would have accepted this kind of generic quality in its cutscenes. However, the reason videogames can get away with substandard dialogue and/or story is because they can make up for it with what their audience really craves: a fun game. This is a movie. You fail at dialogue and storytelling and you've already lost 50% of the money you could have made otherwise because that is exactly half of what movie audiences want from you. When it comes to videogames, dialogue and story (while they have grown in importance since) were more like 5% of what was needed back in Tomb Raider's heyday.",2017-09-20T16:52:25.000Z,0

I have nothing against the reboot games, as they are better than the later 'original' games, but they could have put in enough original stuff to fill at least a trailer. That worsened by all the scenes not stolen from the game being stolen from any other action movie.
The actress seems to fit the image of the reboot Lara though, I haven't seen anything she's been in, so I cannot comment on her acting. But the comments about needing big breasts is ridiculous given that it is obviously 'based' off of the reboot games.",2017-09-20T16:41:10.000Z,0

Other directors have went down that path, and nearly all of them failed miserably. Furthermore, if you absolutely have to make a game-based movie, at least understand the game first. The original Tomb Raider movies(with Angelina Jolie) were, in my opinion, fucking terrible. Angelina Jolie certainly had the Lara Croft look at the time, but it was ruined by the director's focus on the spectacle rather than substance. I could understand that since the original Tomb Raider games were heavily gameplay-oriented, but since this movie is based on the 2013 reboot(which was criticized for focusing too much on cinematics instead of actual exploration), it's going to be even more embarrassing if you fail to appeal to even that game.",2017-09-20T16:19:16.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Frankly I don't get the hate on Alicia Vikander. She looks just wonderful and I'm excited to see her take this role. My only concern is how the story is going to play out. For those who played the 2013 reboot would know, the story wasn't a ""Save the world"" scenario. It started out as a group of explorers who washed up on an island, suddenly trying to get off said island, and then it got into the whole world resurrection of a evil Deity that would possibly destroy the world.

I wish it would go a bit that route, but it looks like they are telling the tale of Lara Croft trying to stop and save the world from impending doom, not the adventurers who washed up on an island. It would make for some greater suspense and horror angles I feel. 

Lastly, is she already comfortable killing? Her first kill in the game made her break down, it was hard to do, and it was just to hunt and survive. Her first human kill was out of necessity to survive. I want to see this, but it looks like she was already comfortable beating up and killing bad guys.",2017-09-20T15:36:42.000Z,36
2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Actress doesn't fit (too thin, can't act, very little facial range). Cinematography looks amateurish. CGI looks low budget. Using Trinity/the father in the first of a reboot series is a silly idea - gives too much away at the start and detracts from Lara's personal development and goals. 

This looks more like a B movie than a reboot of a TR franchise.",2017-09-20T15:36:33.000Z,0

I'm aware that giving an old concept a new lick of paint isn't exactly talentless, but creating a new concept is something that used to be done _as well as_ all the work that's required to give something a new paint job - the story, acting, design, production and editing, as well as creating a concept. Not just pulling an old idea out the draw of other people's work and saying 'new millenniumify it.'

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,I'm a little confused. Is this a movie adaptation of the new games? The boat scene seems very similar and Trinity and her father were pretty central to the rise of the tomb raider. Is it shared cannon with the new games like assassins creed was? Lara is obviously recast. Is it just a remake of the films with Angelina Jolie or are we supposed to forget they ever existed? Guess i'm overthinking this.,2017-09-20T15:19:22.000Z,3

She is a great actress and I feel she could actually pull Lara Croft off but everything in this trailer feels wrong from the writing to the directing. Such a shame because we haven't had a good treasure hunter movie since the Nicolas Cage National treasure films and oh can't forget Sahara! This just looks sloppy and lazy and I'm betting it will be full of cringe.

 For the ""I watched a two minute debut trailer and I already know for a fact that this actor will ruin it"" group. It amazes me that you all have not learned your lesson. Yes, not all casting choices work, but at least wait until you have seen the film before you make ignorant statements.
This is coming from someone who admits that they aren't wowed by the trailer either. I have both games (they are amazing) so I'm not blind to the fact that it looks like it was lifted straight from the games, but it is a trailer. Trailers are edited to show you want they want you to see. Look at her wrapped hand and leg and her bound wrists: a lot of that shit is out of order, so I would bet it isn't filmed shot for shot from the game.

The new Tomb Raider games are fine and I did really enjoy the first one, but I found the second one to be kinda tedious. And the story is fairly boring to me. For a treasure hunter story it really lacks something the charm that the great ones have. Such as Indiana Jones and the old Mummy films. And especially from the leading character. The new Lara is just way too serious for my tastes and she seems to be the same in this movie. That is why I prefer Uncharted over Tomb Raider because Nathan Drake is just a way more fun character.

But at least this movie seem to have dual pistols, something the new games lacks. I will probably give it a chance at least, but then again it is a movie based on a game. Very few of those are good.",2017-09-20T14:33:42.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"I'm really disappointed with the negative reactions here, Lara Croft is an idol of mine and will forever be one of my favorite video game franchises and character. I personally don't care about her physical traits, as long as they at least get the accent, hair, and eye color right. Which they did. Boobs should be entirely irrelevant. Lara was much more than that, she was intelligent, fierce, brave, and a complete badass who was willing to stop whoever or whatever was in the way of her objective. My only complaint with Tomb Raider was the rebooted game itself because it took a lot away from why we all loved playing as Lara. The classic Lara will forever be my favorite. At least for me, and she was iconic with her dual pistols- which made me so sad to see them stripped away in the reboot. So the last scene here had such an impact because the director here saw an opportunity to bridge a gap between the original we know and love with the reboot, which wasn't bad but could have been better. This is just an opinion, and everyone is entitled to their own of course, I am just choosing to be optimistic about this as a fan. So fingers crossed that this film breaks the curse of video game based films.

She doesn't look British enough. She looks more American. She doesn't have that English face. Also too skinny. Not as big a deal as with Wonder Woman, but still off. I mean, when you're so skinny you're skinnier than the rebooted Lara, you gotta put on some skin. Old Lara=thicc hot toned lady. New Lara=normal body, toned and pretty. This Lara=skinny almost lanky body, toned, and okay looking. I just think the casting was off. Hopefully, the acting is good. I mean, the suspension of disbelief is already there but it's fine because it's a video game and it's Lara Croft, but when you make her even skinnier than the reboot, and seemingly less muscle mass, how am I to believe she won't just die when she falls from a ledge? And based on what little footage we've seen, she doesn't really seem to act like the new or old Lara. Maybe it'll turn out fine, but she just seems kinda bland.

2. Playing the same two strings from black betty over and over and over

3. Revolving your trailer around said repetitive music, rather than having the music flow and match your trailer

4. Noticed some realllly bad cgi

5. Its already lacking an identity, looking more like a generic action film rather than a tomb raider movie, hell even Jolies‚Äô film had more fun to it

6. Generic bad guy slowly touching the good guys face cliche

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"It looks like it'll make the mistakes that Assassin Creed did.  Every video game to movie translation is the same: ""We need huge action sequences!  The bigger, the better!  Character development? Protagonist charisma? Pfft!  Who has time for that!!!!""  These writers and directors hear 'video game origin' and instantly forget the reason people like/love certain characters is because of their personalities and charm, ie: Nathan Drake, Lara Croft, etc.; it's not JUST about the jumping and shooting that draws in the fan base.  Game adaptations always seem to ignore that little fact and only focus on the action and explosions... thus they're always doomed to mediocrity.  They just 'insert XYZ' actor who is hot atm and figure that will entice people into the theater.  I guess we'll have to wait and see, but the ""I have to SAVE THE WORLD!"" trope doesn't give me much hope.",2017-09-20T13:34:15.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"It's unbelievable how nitpicky and spoiled people are. It's actually rather hilarious. Big whoop it has a couple of corny lines, that doesn't make the movie. I mean, if it does for you, I feel really bad for you if one little flaw can make or break an entire piece of entertainment. Idk, audiences these days seemed to have very restricted and narrow minds, very little room for anything else besides ridiculously high standards, or just a very very specific thing they want, that if they don't get it's terrible right off the bat. Haters act like a bunch of children in a candy shop, but they don't get the exact candy they want. There's a variation of it, in the same flavor, but since it's not the EXACT candy they want, it's terrible... even without trying it. They just look at it and go, ""Well, it's not the candy I want, so it's terrible. WAAAAHHH!! I WANT MY CANDY!!!!! *draws a shitty picture* THIS ONE!!!! GIVE IT TO ME NOW!!!! *stomps feet*"" <--- That's what all the haters in this comment section sound like. I mean, really... if you actually listen to yourselves rofl. It's rather amusing. Anyway, you guys can enjoy NOT enjoying anything in your lives due to Nitpick Syndrome, meanwhile I'm going to enjoy life and the epic-looking movies that come out throughout, such as this one (and no, I don't think it's perfect, but nothing is perfect and nothing has to be perfect to be enjoyable, I know that's a very new concept for most of you, but that's the truth).",2017-09-20T13:19:41.000Z,0

2. No original ideas
3. Shot for shot scenes from game, the plane, the boat, the parachute, the waterfalls
4.The whole world is in trouble plot (its cool in games, but make it a personal story for the movie)
5. The asian (sorry) guy seems like fun addition, as well as dude from hot fuzz
6. Walter goggins seems like odd choice for villain but he is a good actor
7. Just looks uninspired, its cash grab based of well recieved game. No love AT ALL

Huge disapointment, when they approach game movies with love, then we can expect something actually good. Untill then, more of the same. Fuck. Had my hopes up high

P.S. She doesnt look the part, but neither did Ledger and he made for best joker, but seems like she will be shallow as fuck as character.",2017-09-20T12:26:23.000Z,0

No lessons learned from Deadpool. Unles your action hero is a super human from out of space, you don't need them saving the World every five minutes to up the stakes.

Sigh.

I'm sick and tired of the ""the fate of the world is in your hands"" schtick. It would make an excellent adventure movie if it was more like the game and less.. hollywood.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"I would describe myself as more of an old-school _Tomb Raider_ player, for the most part, as I simply prefer the vastness and openness of the original four games.   What had always been my primary interest in the series was its brutally-non-linear approach to level design.  

It was because of this that, when I began to see trailers for TR 2013, my initial reaction was:  ""Hmmm.  Yeah.  It seems they were more interested in making a film than a video game"".  

Now, perhaps it is simply a side-effect of old age, but I am not the biggest supporter of the idea that video games and movies should begin to homogenize the differences between the two.  In fact, I find it disheartening to so often hear and read that ""video games are _art_, now"".  Why only now, though?  Because they're trying to be something that they're not?  

Video games were _always_ art.  Simply adopting the tenets of another art form for the apparent purpose of validating itself to a broader demographic does not change that fact.

TR 2013 was not really a video game.  It was an interactive test-screening for what you see in this trailer.  

I love Alicia Vikander as an actor, and I love the iterations of _Tomb Raider_ which actually qualify as video games; but, this just looks bland.  Some of the CGI is _Resident Evil_ levels of bad.  You couldn't put that through another render, just to get it looking like it actually belongs in reality?

Everyone seems so bored in this.  Bah.  I'm ranting, at this point.  

tl;dr:  I'm old.",2017-09-20T11:57:48.000Z,0

-fighting to save the world, and at our heart we know that the world won't end in this movie, destroying the tension; this also takes away from character development  throughout the movie
-too many setpieces: just seeing this trailer sliced up of a ton of giant setpieces means that this movie will probably just be another Transformers; a big action movie that relies more on fake special effects than on character development/storytelling
-she has no partner or anybody to talk to, so she'll either be guided by many others along her path making her seem like a passive protagonist or she'll talk out loud very often to herself making the movie awkward",2017-09-20T11:41:34.000Z,0

> I already noticed two separate Action shots were the same scene, but different perspective. Which might mean that there isn't that much action for a full trailer or they don't want to give to much away.

Also I know it's an adaptation of the Square Enix games, but they don't have to copy and paste the whole game into this. Be creative, hint at the game, make it almost a third game where it's in the same universe but different look and outcome.",2017-09-20T11:12:24.000Z,1

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"0:12 fake bow string pull sounds. It would be nice if these studios stop using such generic action music and generic action scenes. Why could they have not made this rendition more quiet, slow paced. Give tomb exploring a more intense feel, gives us anticipation of an intricate deadly traps setting off. Make that the focus of Tomb Raider, then on the second or third act play up a bit of action with the rival raiders or big bad.

This film just looks like something I've seen a dozen times already, but minus any iconic characters for the dead brain side of me to point at and go ""Oh. Look. That. Is. A. Thing. I. Recognize. From. My. Easily. Abused. Nostalgia."" while I slurp up my cola and not have the brain function to wipe the steady line of drool coming from my mouth.

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,I think its hilarious that people are moaning about this before seeing it! ¬† Firstly stop asking for Jolie to come back.. her (very average) films were dead and buried long ago! Plus she's in her 40s. ¬†Also those asking for Camila Luddington are also out of their minds.. Don't get me wrong she was perfect for the games.. but lets be honest she is a B-rate actor who's biggest role outside of Tomb raider was on grey's anatomy.. ¬†Alicia is an Oscar winning actress who is not only incredible in every role she's taken on but she also looks a lot like the Lara from the games this film is modelled after. This could shape up to be a great (video game) movie! ¬†If people just give it a chance and get their heads out of their asses!!,2017-09-20T12:12:28.000Z,88

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"Ok I know how it will sound but hear me out: This version looks a lot like a Mary Sue.
Let me explain.

A Mary Sue character most important feature is that everything in the world revolves around her (or him, if it is a Gary Stu, aka male).
Everything about the story and the plot is build around the character. She is good at everything she does and everybody is admiring her even if there is no noticable reason for it. Just her name is causing a reaction although she never did anything to earn that reaction. Never breaking a sweat despite doing things an actual athlete might fail and she beeing a skinny teenager. And she is doing all that while looking pretty.

Even if all of that wouldn't be true the trailer is still very generic, showing mostly the highlights of the action scenes (which are most likely 90% of all the good action scenes in the movie. Because trailers..) and bulletpoints of the story. if there is any good action in the movie you don't see it in this trailer. Most of the acting here is staring in the distance like so many other young female actresses in the last years..

TL;DR: not impressed. It looks a lot like any other lazy franchise adaptation of the last decades. If it isn't the trailer didn't show that.
I expect a run to the mill action movie that will do good enough at the box-office but not that many liked all that much.",2017-09-20T10:22:17.000Z,0

Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me, fool me three times and you're officially *that* guy. Yeah this shit looks worse than Assassin's Creed which also had a great big star actor who had no right to be in a video game ""adaption"". That CGI is god awful too, this is considered decent enough to show to the public for a multimillion dollar movie? For fucks sake they couldn't even get a poster right by making the environment and clothing look fake as well as her tool but looked like she elongated her neck.
Plus she looks nothing close to either the original or the reboot. You can not say that she has the lack of a figure and still say she looks like either of the two sources.
And I'm sensing a complete tonal shift near the end of the trailer. That's the ending scene. 100%. It's a bullshit cliffhanger ""look at her lookin all badass ready to go on another wacky adventure. Look she even has her guns, wow wee"".
Does it want to be the reboot or does it want to be like the original. Because if they keep trying to do both the movie is just going to be an incoherent mess with an identity problem.
Plus it looks like every other video game movie. It looks nearly identical to the likes of Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed.",2017-09-20T10:18:34.000Z,40

I've play almost all the games and i'm a bog fan of the games! I think this movie look awesome :D Remember this is BEFORE she is the badass we know her as. I agree the Angelina jolie movies sucked but this i tihnk is going to be awesome :) I agree whit one comment that Camilla should play Lara Croft. But i think Alicia Vikander is a perfect choice for the role :) Give it a chance and after you seen it you can naggin about it. I hate when people complain way before the movies or games realses. This is what i think and i'm going to see this at the cinima and give it a chance. Take care!,2017-09-20T09:32:11.000Z,0

I mean why would I watch that movie if I already played the game? or watch it over playing the game? usually movies based on video games offer a lesser experience than playing the actual game, that doesn't always have to be the case but unfortunately it's the truth, and since the video game and the movie both seem to offer the exact same thing with very very tiny variations between the two it seems, and if I have access to a computer and can actually play the game why would I go for the lesser experience?
I'm not bashing the movie but for me movie adaptation of the game shouldn't be near carbon copy of the game, it should offer me something interesting or relatively new, while of course staying true to the source material, the way they went about this movie just feels lazy to me.",2017-09-20T08:11:32.000Z,0

I'd like to use Logan here as an example. At its heart, it was a great drama film with some X and adamantium sprinkled in the mix. It wasn't your basic superhero movie with CGI etc. Someone should take similar action with video game movies and break the cycle. I know creating something new might seem difficult and daunting as we saw with Assassin's Creed. But they lost their way with the 85% modern day stuff. Find the aspect which makes the game amazing and build on that. Just don't rehash the story from the game because most of us have already spent tens of hours experiencing it.

TL;DR Pls break teh cycle and git gud.",2017-09-20T13:19:47.000Z,41

To me, this lacks soul. I don't get the adventure vibe, I don't get the feeling that she is in danger, afraid, emotional, vulnerable, alive. 

It looks not as fun as the Indy movies, the National Treasure movies, the Fraser Mummy movies, and not even as the Jolie Lara Croft movies, as they all left me with intrigue and excitement, even the trailers. It's also not as cool as the Fast movies or as witty as the Kingsmen. It looks almost more like another boring Far Cry movie, even though it hits so much TR beats.

This has such a generic by the numbers feel to it and looks like a 6-7/10 netflix adaptation where I tell my friends that I was surprised the effects looked not as cheap as expected, but only watch it because it's part of the subscription and when you got nothing else to do. 

The music and voiceover doesn't help either, it has a fanmade trailer vibe to it. 

Only Nick Frosts appearance made me go ""ooooh"" and I smiled. It is the only positive reaction I had watching this trailer. Not the pun, just him being there. When this is the best part of the trailer, I feel worried for the movie.",2017-09-20T06:45:54.000Z,0

2017-09-20T04:56:28.000Z,8ndhidEmUbI,TOMB RAIDER - Official Trailer #1,"You had me until ""save the world"". That's not what Tomb Raider's about. What Lara does means something to her personally, that's what drives the games, and since people not only play as her but come to care about her as a character, then what's important to her becomes important to the audience. The whole ""save the world"" thing has become far too overplayed and impersonal. Look at Civil War for example. The world wasn't at stake, everything that was at stake was personal to the characters and people cared about them so much, that their personal struggles came to mean something to audiences, people connected with the characters. This feels generic and impersonal right from the get go. If I wanted this and wanted to feel some personal gravity about the situation, I'd play the reboot game. You tried, but not hard enough.

Also, when you make the stakes ""Save the world"" you put yourself into a situation where there's only one possible outcome, so you already know how this ends. Spoiler alert: She saves the world, sequel teaser, end.",2017-09-20T06:02:39.000Z,43

Why does it need to put the whole world in peril? I'm not entirely sold on Alicia from a physical standpoint. Her running doesn't look entirely believable. However I will say some of the visuals and sequences look pretty legit. Like her grunt/yell, and her falling into the river looks pretty legit and believable.
