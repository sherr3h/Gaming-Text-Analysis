Yes, anyone should have the right to live the way they want, but ultimately people seeing that as the point of this movie seem to be ignoring what a selfish fucking asshole the father is.   Yes, I get that he has PTSD and that must be a fucking shitty hand to be dealt, but even in the face of it, if you can't pull it together for the sake of your own daughter then you should at least have the courage to know you can't be a good parent when you first recognize that's not the life she wants, and make sure she is taken care of by someone else.  Instead he keeps dragging her into his own misery and nearly gets her killed.  I personally don't find the character very sympathetic.   Great movie though.",2019-09-30T15:09:46.000Z,0

Too many beautiful, warm and worthy hearts, come back to home soil and gradually, silently withdraw...feeling like there is no place for them.  Unattended to, misunderstood, or if they ""fail to adapt,"" the fire of each lonely heart is scattered like embers and eventually goes cold and still.  Some numb the pain of unbelonging with spirits or pills or needles. Others are made to feel so broken or dangerous that they spiral into patterns of homelessness.  Our nation is sick in so many ways and our priorities are drastically out of whack.  But as long as we have been on this earth, nature has been the ONE place of healing for the broken.  Now those sacred places are blocked off and patrolled.  The message to those who come home is not: ""Welcome home,"" but rather ""No trespassing.""",2019-01-06T04:55:38.000Z,0

This is when I first saw the trailer for this amazing movie, and the first time I heard The Maze, by Manchester Orchestra. After a little digging, I found out who was singing the song in this trailer, and I immediately became a fan. Eight months later, I listen to the music on their album A Black Mile To The Surface on a daily basis. I can't thank this movie enough for giving me a band that has changed my life. Click the link below, if you want to listen to the album as well. 

The link below that one is for the song I Know How To Speak, released a year later, by itself. They wanted it to be on the album, but didn't feel it was ready. It's a beautiful song, that begs to be listened to, again and again.

I haven't seen this movie and I probably will even though I've got an inkling that it will leave a bone in my throat because it will portray a fiercely individualistic family as the product of mental imbalance and psychological injury -rather than portraying raising a family in that manner as a choice as authentic and legitimate as any other.",2018-07-25T21:50:59.000Z,1

It reflects the reality than Individuality is lost as part of the system of putting people in boxes ran by burocrats. The one scene that probably makes her reconsider being normal is in the bus, the fact that you are at the mercy of the system that is supposed  in the first farm to help them is impossible to ignored. Being surrounded by people who are so full of themselves or ignored others unlike her freewheeling forest life is contrasting. In the end, her father cannot escape his PSTD Ghosts, so he stays to help him.

see jim over there, he come into town once a week to sell his furs. he has a camp just out side of Carson city up the hills away. he is happy and gets along.

100 years latter.

see jim, he has no skills because modern society frowns on self reliance and will mock him or call him a crazy prepper. it's illegal to hunt with out a permit, he cannot live off the land or live on PUBLIC LAND and stands on the road side with a sign begging for food, and money for drugs and alcohol because his life is hell.

this movie seems to be about a vet with a bad case of PDSD. and i feel for my brothers and sisters who live that hell. but this movie is also about the freedom we had, and gave up to the asshats who we voted in to make the rules. we did not lose the freedom. we gave it away.

Update: I had to go to a boutique theater to watch this. I guess it's only playing in very select few places. The movie was quite good. Superb performance by Ben Foster, he's becoming one of my new favorite actors. The actress for the daughter was also very convincing. I was pleasantly suprised to find very little stereotypes which was refreshing. I recommend that anyone curious about this movie go watch and enjoy.",2018-07-10T06:16:39.000Z,561
