But, the story just falls flat for me. The film wasn't actually centred on trying to find George Clooney's character. In the end they just stumble upon him by accident.

It doesn't have a very satisfying story or conclusion but it's great as a period piece. You do actually immersed in the golden era of filmmaking. It reminds me of the film Inherent Vice, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. The story isn't very important in that film either but you can enjoy just hanging out in this world with these characters.",2017-10-17T15:09:38.000Z,0

If anything, the central ransom plot is minor and inconsequential and there are several characters who have nothing to do with the plot that get loads of screen time. In lieu of plot, the movie focuses dialogue, style, aesthetic and romantic depiction of another way of life.  It isn't funny but it isn't trying to be.  It was sort of like a Big Lebowski, in that the entire movie is a mess of characters and places, but minus the hilarity and plus more mid-century optimism.

""The Big Lebowski""has tons of plot filler that adds nothing to the plot, and ""No Country For Old Men"" just ends on a confusing note. The biggest difference I guess is that those  movies had compelling characters and still had a some form of resolution. 'The Dude abides' somehow became a cult religion. Here, the characters are too simple, but the performances are fun. George Clooney is playing an pompous, air-headed actor; who better for that role than him? There resolution may not be much and definitely not enough to leave an impact, but does that really make it a bad film? No, it's a just standard Coen stuff.

I don't think their films are particularly funny , in fact most of the time i don't even get them . It's as if i should be laughing but i'm not in on their private joke. 
Hail , Caesar is about a fixer in Hollywood ( Josh Brolin) who is paid by the studio to keep the actors in line. 
There are some interesting performances from George Clooney and Alden Ehrenreich and a very camp but hypnotic musical scene lead by Channing Tatum .
The critics really liked this , i think , because it's about the industry they critic on but for me it was just another oddly entertaining Coen brothers film that i have many times before. MY RATING - 6 out of 10",2016-04-21T21:21:58.000Z,0

Acting is good and plot is interesting. Its also not SciFi don't let those trailers fool you. Its a film set in the fifties centred around the fifties film industry amongst other things which I wont divulge as I don't want to spoil the film. I give it 3 out of 5 stars and that's due to the film feeling as though it was filmed in the fifties. The experience was like watching an old Saturday matinee. The ending was a non event.

A jumble of elements that all fall into place principally through Brolin's character - he's really the center in terms of understanding the big theme here, which is one I get perfectly.  You feel overworked, stressed, unsure from the constant demands of your job  - roping in people, problems, crazy challenges, idiocies, betrayals, endless details...  You want to quit and find a door opens to an easy and lucrative opportunity, but... you know you'll never quit because you love the crazy - in this case Hollywood film making.  Josh Brolin plays this perfectly.  George Clooney is a brainless actor - also brilliantly done.  Everyone else has modest parts but they all add up:  the suits, the director (Fiennes) the religious folk, the communists, the cowboy, singers, dancers, bit part players, gossip columnists - all of them.  The film they are making, about ""The Christ"" suggests that insult to the Person or the event will occur, but it never does, and isn't meant to.  It nearly becomes saintly at the end (that faith scene here is the last one), but the Coen brothers' unique wit steps in before it gets either too noble or too mocking.  It's a well put together movie and I'll see it again.  Oh, see it on big screen while you can, by the way - there's a lot in the scenery you don't want to miss.",2016-02-07T03:39:52.000Z,1

The reason is this:  the Cohen's have been on a roll and in the past, this means they divert into areas that of artist interest to them but are not cinematic hits.  On the former point, 'artist interest' can be interpreted into just about anything.  Oh, but what the heck, am I going to see it opening night?  You bet!  Because even the films that have garnered less praise and attention have been the stuff of great movie moments for me.
