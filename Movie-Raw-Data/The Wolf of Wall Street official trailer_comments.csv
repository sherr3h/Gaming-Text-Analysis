2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"In 1987, Jordan Belfort procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for L.F. Rothschild, employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker's only goal is to make money for himself.

Jordan soon finds his career terminated following Black Monday and takes a job at a boiler room brokerage firm on Long Island that specializes in penny stocks.

Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.

Jordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company.

They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the ""hard sell"".

The basic method of the firm is a pump and dump scam.

To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of Stratton Oakmont.

After an expos√© in Forbes, hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company.

Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs.

He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia.

When his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi.

Meanwhile, the SEC and the FBI begin investigating Stratton Oakmont.

Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the IPO of Steve Madden.

This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI.

To hide his money, Jordan opens a Swiss bank account with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities.

He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.

Donnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested.

Brad does not say a word about Donnie or Jordan to the police.

Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones.

Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison.

Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech.

Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. 

Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account.

To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm.

After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine.

Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.

Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan.

Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency.

Now fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children.

After Naomi slaps Jordan when he calls her a ""cunt"", Jordan hits her, snorts cocaine, and then hits Naomi again when she tries to physically stop him from taking their daughter, Skylar; he gets into the car with her but crashes into a brick pillar while pulling out of the garage.

The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work, but slips a note to Donnie, warning him.

Donnie keeps the note and rats out Jordan to the FBI.

Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal.

The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont.

Despite his breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves three years in a minimum security prison.

After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.",2018-12-23T20:01:41.000Z,2

Mirages of matchstick men and you
All I ever see is them and you
Windows echo your reflection
When I look in their direction now
When will this haunting stop?
Your face, it just won't leave me alone

True story about Hugh Glass. I'm not sure if his story has been made into a movie before but this rendition looks dramatic. It could very very well be Best Actor to Leo and Best support to Tom Hardy. They both deserve it. Obviously nobody has seen the movie yet but those 2 are the best actors around besides Daniel Day Lewis.

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"Meiner Meinung nach DiCaprio's bester Film aller Zeiten. Seine Leistung als Schauspieler in diesem Film ist einfach nur schlicht und ergreifend Genial ! Die Art wie er seine Rolle in diesem Film verk√∂rpert und zugleich den Zuschauer fesselt, ist einzigartig. Dieser Mann hat die Gabe bzw. Eigenschaft sich mit seiner Rolle vollkommen zu ""verschmelzen"". Als Zuschauer meint man, er sei diese Person die er spielt in Wirklichkeit. Dies ist nicht nur bei The Wolf Of Wall Street so, sondern bei Django: Unchained und Der Grosse Gatsby genau der selbe Fall. Das Leonardo DiCaprio bis heute keinen Oscar erlangen konnte, ist die gr√∂√üte Frechheit Hollywood's schlechthin ! Sie vergeben f√ºr jeden durchschaubaren 08/15 Film einen Preis, warum dann nicht auch mal f√ºr eine tats√§chliche Meisterleistung ? Er ist nicht mehr dieser liebe kleine Junge aus dem Titanic Film den alle kennen. Die Zeiten haben sich ge√§ndert und ich finde Hollywood sollte genauso mit der Zeit gehen. Ich bin mir nahezu sicher, dass einige sich meiner Meinung anschlie√üen. Sp√§testens dann wenn Sie diesen Film gesehen haben.

Liebe Filmfreunde, ich kann euch diesen gro√üartigen Film nur ans Herz legen. Anschauen lohnt sich ! :)",2014-11-10T01:58:21.000Z,0

If it hadn't been for your fans' massive support in the period after Titanic, you would now have been dead in some gutter, because as an actor you're not worth that much, and your performance in Titanic was rather poor.

This film will probably be remembered as the worst film Scorsese ever made. Not so much a Scorsese film as self-parody, or a Scorsese-wannabe imitator just starting out in Hollywood; not least because of the unrelenting awfulness of the real life character Dicaprio portrays, who imo has even less charm and integrity than the worst of America's serial killers. - It's as misguided as GOODFELLAS would have been if Tommy DeVito had been the main character instead of Henry Hill or Jimmy Conway. The evil and psychopathic Max Cady in the Scorsese remake CAPE FEAR seems like a saint in comparison, but atleast Cady has the redeeming literary and cinematic virtue of being a work of fiction, rather than a real life convicted felon who ruined people's lives. .- Both the film and the main character are a glossy piece of sh*t. Others can decide which stinks most, Belfort or the movie.",2014-06-03T02:32:10.000Z,0

One review on IMDB was complaining about why it doesn't talk about Wall Street. If you actually knew anything you would know its about JORDAN BELFORT and what he went through, and then they complain about the drugs and the sex. Again read THE BOOK. It's 10x more raunchy then the film. Then they complain about the length of the film, i didn't hear anyone complain about Schindlers List being 3hrs and 15min long. What people don't understand is that this is based on actual events (not the movie because they added stuff in there) and they expect a whole decade to be crammed into an hour and 30min. THIS IS AN AMAZING BADASS MOVIE . Movies like this only come once in a lifetime yet people complain like little bitches.

I recently saw Dallas Buyers Club and The Wolf of Wallstreet. Although they were very different movies, the roles were somewhat similar. Struggling men going through a rough patch in life. don;t get me wrong, ""Ron"" on Dallas Buyers Club was an interesting and very difficult role, but Leonardo's character was was far more diverse. ""Ron"" was the same ol jackass the entire time, while Leonardo played happy, sad, aggression, addict, drunk, rich, poor, sex-driven, money-hungy, low-life, romantic, and ol jackass on top of that. His role was phenomenal, and that's why Matthew McConaughey didn't deserve to win for Dallas Buyers Club. I respect both come come fuck on, Academy!

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"Kinda unfair to compare Wolf of Wall Street to Goodfellas just because it's a Scorcese film. Anyway, the movie was fucking great. I read that Jonah Hill took took a massive pay cut just because he really wanted to be in this movie. Him and Leo did amazing jobs. They sold their characters very well. I like how some of the scenes run longer than you would expect, but they don't lose steam in the middle. Yeah, the movie didn't need to be 3 hours long but it wasn't painful to sit and watch like The Desolation of Smaug, or something similar, where you're constantly thinking ""Okay, when the fuck will this end?"" And in typical Scorcese fashion, he has you rooting for the main character even though he was a god damn criminal. Wolf of Wall Street and American Hustle both bring a bit of much needed revitalization to Hollywood. I'd re-watch both for sure.",2014-04-06T20:43:28.000Z,0

For people commenting that there were ""too many F-bombs"" if you read the book, it was exactly the same. Jordan explains that in every stock firm, curses and offensive language was the norm, and actually if you didn't use them on a regular basis(every other word), it was weird. Most of the ""shock value"" scenes (I.e when Donnie/Danny eats the fish) actually took place. I think some commenters think the Scorsese or the production team tried to make it more than what it was, and that simply isn't true. Dialog and all, you can recall the same events to the book written by Jordan. Anyways, read the damn book, that's all I can suggest. ",2014-04-02T15:53:39.000Z,0

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"We can at last confirm an artist's talent by observing how widely misunderstood he is - not only among those diverted herds excessively proud of their nauseating First Amendment, but even by the self-righteous critiques whose elitist choice of words brilliantly fails to hide an indigent choice of thoughts... Yes, sadly enough, Scorcese's grand mistake was to compose a masterpiece far too subtle for an American audience.
To cut a long (yet not as ""excessively long"" as most commentators foolishly parroted) story short : what The Wolf of Wall Street tries to portray is a society where business has literally taken the ascendancy of a new Church.

Idiots -not you, everyone else- will probably read it as a hyperbolic metaphor, but we shall not be trumped : Stratton is a religious sanctuary where weak-minded sectarians can feverishly praise their spiritual leader Belfort.
With such a reading, obvious examples start to abound (mystical rituals, regular services, community-binding songs,...) in what perhaps was too subtle at first; and surely the very last scene, where a jaw-dropping army of buffoon sales folks cannot get enough of their priest's aura will convince the most recalcitrant. Marvel at the profound irony behind numbed crowds, who otherwise would probably sport their 'atheism' with great pride, acting unconsciously like the most fervent believers... and we are desperately left to wonder whether it does not, after all, betray a deeper need in the human psyche as a whole.

It is simply wrong to describe the story as 'amoral', since everything in there rightly illustrates the neo-liberal ideology at its purest, with all its tasteless values and childish codes of behaviour brought to their most religious, most coherent finality. When a critique points out the lack of an obvious moral message (you know, the usual hollywood Manichaean treat to make sure lazy viewers don't have to think too much on their own), he or she simply is too overwhelmed, too absorbed already by an ideology that can therefore no longer be recognized. Concretely speaking, if the vulgarity, the insipid obscenity and meaningless life-forms portrayed in The Wolf were not obviously contemptible to you, wake up. Scorcese's liability ends where yours begins.

Roland Barthes would have smiled like a bored prophet.

To blame it as ""morally shortcoming"" or assess it as ""not particularly thoughtful"" tragically proves the movie's point, along with a 'not particularly glorious' example of self-projection",2014-03-07T14:50:35.000Z,0

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"This is a good film which successfully depicts the yuppie lifestyle of the 80's and all the debauchery and excess that went hand in hand with it.

And that's the problem. Good film or not, there's only so much you can take of scumbag fucking nerds who make a living off of the stupidity of clueless people, and then proceed to fuck and snort their way to the Swiss banks, while laughing their exploding brains out.

It just gets boring very quickly, and this film gives you nearly 3 hours of it!

Besides, Scorcese is by and large repeating himself, yet again.
The Wolf of Wall Street is just Goodfellas in a different setting.

Both films are about the same length, have the same style and are about cash, drugs and fucking.

Yaaaawn!

It started well with Leo's lunch with Matthew McConaughey.
And for a while there, it looked like we were going to be treated to a a more entertaining version of Oliver Stone's Wall Street.
But alas, Matthew disappeared after 5 minutes and was GONE.
And we were left with assholes the same age as Justin Bieber, taking over the world at the world's expense.

So again, it was a very well-made film. It just was about a hateful subject.

Although, the scene where Leo's trying to leave the country club made me cry with laughter!",2014-03-07T06:13:22.000Z,1

The movie is an illusion. Do you really think anyone who takes drugs regularly is in a job of 90+ working hours/week? You wouldn't even get into it.
The case is an exception (based on a true story - to some degree), but doesn't reflect reality of the business by any means. Higher responsibility USUALLY correlates with a perfect CV, working mentality etc. The case of Jordan Belfort is very irregular.

It is just hours and hours of sex, drugs, cursing, etc.
I understand Scorsese was trying to teach us a lesson on what happens when we get carried away with wealth. But in my opinion, there is no moral to this film until the last 30 mins of the movie. 95% of this movie is just partying and sex, I'm not going to list.
There was honestly NO point for this movie. Frankly, it's embarrassing that Hollywood thinks we are willing to even pay to watch this crap.
The only good thing about this movie was the acting. But again, what was the POINT of all that acting?
Waste of 3 hours, in my opinion. Don't waste your money on this garbage. If you want to watch porn, go watch porn. There is no need whatsoever to waste your money watching this film.

A movie review by James Berardinelli
When one thinks of a Martin Scorsese film, the first images that come to mind are dark, violent, serious ones. His most celebrated movies are Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, and The Departed - all intense, uncompromising samples of cinema at its finest. Scorsese, however, has never been easy to pigeonhole; he has always enjoyed playing in unconventional sandboxes. Some may recall that he followed up Casino with Kundun, that he entered Merchant-Ivory territory with The Age of Innocence, or that he predated the Coen Brothers in surreal comedy with After Hours. Scorsese is about far more than mobsters, De Niro, Pesci, and profanity-laden tirades. Nowhere is this more evident that in The Wolf of Wall Street.
The Wolf of Wall Street joins After Hours as the most openly comedic films Scorsese has made. The movie isn't a nonstop treadmill of jokes and gags; instead, the blackly humorous elements are incorporated into a screenplay that questions the ""get rich"" mentality that has always infected Wall Street. Although an indictment of greed, the movie establishes the anti-hero, in this case Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), as a quasi-sympathetic figure. Viewed objectively, Belfort - a materialistic, drug-addicted, womanizing thief - is the kind of character who could easily fill the villain's role. He's the kind of white-collar criminal whose activities led to the 2008 economic melt-down and who would feel at home swapping stories with Bernie Madoff. Yet, by shaping the movie the way he does, Scorsese presents Belfort as a charismatic Caligula. He is an endlessly fascinating character who holds viewers' attention from beginning to end.
Many of Scorsese's best films have used real-life stories as their underpinning, and this is no exception. The director is quick to point out that the screenplay, credited to Terence Winter, is a fictionalization of Belfort's life and takes numerous liberties. This isn't a documentary and it's not intended to be one. As a result, Scorsese can amplify elements of Belfort's life to accentuate the comedy or the tragedy of a given situation. Although The Wolf of Wall Street features some strongly dramatic elements, many of the film's flourishes are designed for laughs.
Throughout his long career, Scorsese has been known for pushing the envelope of the MPAA's R-rating. The Wolf of Wall Street is replete with naked bodies and acts of sexual depravity. There's also copious drug use and frequent profanity but very little in the way of physical violence. This isn't that kind of story. This is about how the pursuit of money above all else can transform a hard-working family man into a kingpin of immorality and debauchery.
This is DiCaprio's fifth outing for Scorsese but the first time in which the director has turned him loose. The result is an astounding, courageous performance the likes of which we haven't yet seen from the talented actor. Throughout the movie, Belfort gives pep talks to his ever-growing flock of broker disciples. These are reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's scathing monologue at the beginning of Glengarry Glen Ross but, instead of galvanizing an audience for ten minutes, DiCaprio does it for three hours.
The Wolf of Wall Street tells the tale of Belfort's rise and fall. Parts are presented in flashback with DiCaprio providing a self-mocking voiceover. It's a rags-to-riches story about a hard-working broker who breaks into the industry in the late '80s and has the misfortune of earning his license on Black Monday, the day of the biggest crash since the '20s. He subsequently loses his job but reinvents himself as a purveyor of ""penny stocks."" Fraud abounds in this ill-regulated dark corner of the financial industry and Belfort rides the wave to wealth. He's able to found his own company, Stratton Oakmont, and surround himself with cronies like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), who shares his taste for quaaludes. He dumps his first wife for a hot blond, Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie). The SEC starts to notice Stratton Oakmont, but Belfort's real problems begin when FBI agent Greg Coleman (Kyle Chandler) opens a file on him.
DiCaprio's turn is ably supported by a tremendous supporting cast. Jonah Hill is creepily effective as Belfort's drug-addled sidekick. It's a part that straddles drama and dark comedy and is perfect for the actor. Matthew McConaughey, who appears in only three scenes, gives an unforgettable speech. Australian actress Margot Robbie amps up the sexual tension with a performance that's likely to expand her Hollywood profile. There are some nice turns by members of Scorsese's directing fraternity (all of whom have previous credits in front of the camera): Spike Jonze, Jon Favreau, and a brilliant Rob Reiner. The movie is littered with acting gems - some from expected sources and some that arrive out-of-the-blue.
By turning this into a comedy, Scorsese assures a different tone from Wall Street and Boiler Room. There are serious aspects to The Wolf of Wall Street but the filmmakers don't want to get caught digging in areas where the ground has already been tilled. Belfort may have the same predatory instincts as Gordon Gekko, but he's not as smart and lives a more extravagant lifestyle. In fact, one could talk at length between similarities between Belfort and DiCaprio's other 2013 character, Jay Gatsby.
I laughed more during The Wolf of Wall Street than I did during any of 2013's ""pure"" comedies. Maybe that's an indication that my warped sense of humor is a match for Scorsese's sensibilities. This is an example of what a supremely talented actor can do under the auspices of one of the best working directors. Some things in The Wolf of Wall Street will undoubtedly offend more sensitive movie-goers but that goes with the territory for Scorsese. The Wolf of Wall Street crackles with energy and justifies its length, offering three of the most riveting hours available this holiday season.",2014-02-06T21:23:46.000Z,1

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"I saw the movie last week. The first hour was good, reminded me of Good fellas, except with a Wall Street twist. The problem with the movie is that Scorsese, or his screenwriter did not have enough knowledge of how Wall Street really works. The opportunity was present in the first act with Matthew Mc's character, but the scene was surprisingly dull. His great Wall Street advice was ""Make sure you do cocaine and jerk off"". What???? ¬† ¬†I would have liked more finance discussion, and less self gratuitous sex scenes. Although Margot Robbie was absolutely fabulous. Also Rob Reiner as Leo's dad..... didn't work for me. ¬† ¬† Another note, the F word. When you say it 5 times every sentence, it loses its effect, and just becomes obscene. In Casino, Joe Pesci's use of it went with the flow, but these guys, it seemed like they were just saying it to be cool. ¬† Casino and Good fellas get better with every viewing, but I don't think I would watch this repeatedly.¬†",2014-01-30T02:12:33.000Z,0

Of course this film has drug, sex and crazy ass shit but the meaning of the movie is Jordan Belfort came up with an ingenious way to sell things to the rich and the poor which made him MILLIONS and it shows his rise to the top and his down fall. The lesson of this movie is to never let yourself go even when you're at the top. The sex, drugs, and crazy shit are the result of the letting yourself go so its relevant to the film, and if you don't like it then go fuck yourself.¬†",2014-01-27T03:50:52.000Z,1

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"This film does an excellent job of portraying the unconscionable culture of excess and unbridled greed. It shows the world what Americans glorify and how our culture is declining into an abyss of self-gratification with no concern for the lives of others or the future of our children. It seems like an entertaining, comedic film but it is actually a satire of the world we now live in. Beware any of you who may decide to have children one day. With the way our culture (and the people commenting below) glorify the people in this film, I wouldn't be surprised if they will one day grow up and sell your souls to the devil (metaphorically speaking) and not look back, so you better all watch your backs. Our downfall may be growing in America's pregnant bellies.¬†",2014-01-26T19:05:02.000Z,1

All the drugs, girls, sex, cheating the system etc. eventually lead to reckless individuals with addictions and more problems and troubles than it was worth.

I didn't understand why people were laughing because I didn't find it funny at all, it's only been uncomfortable and disturbing.

""Hugo"", ""Shutter Island"" and this are really bad movies... There are so many mistakes on that movie that makes you wanna kill the director... One of them is when Matthew and Leonardo are having lunch and the same waiter comes and goes within 1 second.. The other one is when Leonardo's wife caught him in a limousine with the hot blondy. They didn't show us if the limousine left but in the next scene the limousine was gone. And on a different angle the limousine was back to its place... I really like Dicaprio but he needs to stop making movies with Scorsese..",2014-01-19T22:08:35.000Z,1

the middle age of the jury is 60 years old. It means the majority don't like this kind of movie( its too intense.) They prefer sentimental movies. Take the film The Artist, Jean Dujardin won this oscar because it was a movie in Black and White, a silent movie...etc it reminds them of the good time.

And then they don't really like Leonardo DIcaprio, (unfortunately because he's one of the best actor of the past ¬†decencies ) Trust me I know what I say.

The story starts quick enough, for a 3 hour film its not long winded, it gets straight into it. It has more of a comedy sense feel to it because of Jonah Hill playing a huge part, but that's fine. It has 8.7 on IMDB & deservedly so, and I'll tell you why its not more, because the people who have given this film under a 7 are the Grumpy/None funny guys who clearly dont like Jonah Hills influence on this, the Amount of Nudity may have offended some, the amount of drugs. The major factor which I'd probably say people weren't a fan was of the Against the homophobic scene, where they almost tear into gays. And in Jonah hills says Fags, fucking faggot's, disguisting etc etc.",2014-01-10T22:12:59.000Z,0

Above the Law
10 Reasons the Real-Life ""Wolf of Wall Street"" Is a Schmuck Who Shouldn't Be Glamorized
By Paul Teetor
Tue, Dec 17, 2013 at¬† 6:00 AM
¬†Categories: Above the Law

These days, Jordan Belfort is flying high again. Not only is the real-life ""Wolf of Wall Street"" living high on the hog in beautiful Hermosa Beach, he's making money as a motivational speaker -- a business that will surely only increase in light of the new Martin Scorsese movie based on his life, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
But as the Weekly reported yesterday, Belfort is hardly penitent -- in fact, lawyers and prosecutors say he's continued to screw his victims, only repaying pennies on the dollar of the millions he swindled from them.

And that's not the only reason we think he's a schmuck. We did our homework so you don't have to, both reading his book and studying the court record. Here are the 10 reasons why we refuse to glamorize him -- DiCaprio or no DiCaprio.
¬†
10. He Wasn't Really a Wolf ... BELFORD GAVE HIMSELF THE NICKNAME ""Wolf of Wall Street"" TO ROMANTICIZE his SORDID STORY AND BUILD his BRAND. ""In eight years of working with him, I never heard anyone call him the Wolf or anything like that,"" says Danny Porush, Belfort's partner from 1988-96 in the investment banking firm Stratton Oakmont.
9. ... And He Didn't Work on Wall Street Belfort's investment banking firm, Stratton Oakmont, was located in Lake Success, Long Island, almost an hour from Wall Street. But he trained his brokers to tell investors they were calling from Wall Street, where they had their fingers on the pulse of the economy. The Wolf of Long Island just didn't have the same zing.
8. His Business Acumen Was Limited to Fraud His scheme wasn't even all that clever, just that tired old pump-and-dump stock fraud that's been going on so long it's got whiskers on it. Business 101 students know the drill: cold-call gullible investors, establish credibility by having them make a little money in a solid stock, then convince them you have the inside track on something new and hot that they should pour their money in. When you manage to pump the price up and they make more paper profits, convince them to bet the ranch -- and then ignore their sell orders while you cash out your own blocks of stock at the top of the market, leaving your sucker investors grasping for air as the price drops like a stone.
. He Was a Phony He dubbed his firm Stratton Oakmont because he wanted it to sound WASPY and elite, but there was no Stratton and there was no Oakmont. Just two self-described ""Savage Jew"" hustlers named Belfort and Porush.
6. He Sold Out His Pals He only served 22 months in prison (Tommy Chong, busted for selling bongs over the internet, was his cellmate) thanks to his decision to wear a wire and rat out his friends and colleagues and then testify against them.
5. His Remorse Is a Fairly Recent Invention Belfort's stock answer whenever he was questioned about the morality of what he did to his investors: ""Hey, Nobody got killed."" Kansas City attorney Diane Nygaard, who represented dozens of Belfort investors, says she is aware of several elderly investors whose lives were destroyed and never recovered from the shock of losing their life savings.
¬†Today the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" lives in an Italianate mansion just feet from the ocean in Hermosa Beach. So much for paying back his victims. - STEPHANIE LOO Stephanie Loo
Today the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" lives in an Italianate mansion just feet from the ocean in Hermosa Beach. So much for paying back his victims.

4. Even Bill Clinton Only Wrote One Book of Memoirs It wasn't enough to write one memoir about his stock stealing, drug sniffing, girl-chasing days at Stratton Oakmont. He had to follow it up with a second memoir, Catching the Wolf of Wall Street, that recycles the same stories of crime and debauchery and serves mainly as an extended justification for why he ratted out so many friends and colleagues to gain a shorter prison sentence.
3. Oh, and the Writing? His bizarre fixation on the repulsive phrase ""loamy loins"" to describe the nether regions of women he is banging, be they hookers or wives. In his first memoir, especially, it's used like a verbal tic. No reader should have to endure alliteration that cheesy.
2. Only College Freshmen Brag About How High They Are He spent seven years constantly high on cocktails of sedatives, cocaine, crack and ecstasy, which he insists on spelling out in loving detail, as if somehow he can transfer the high sensations to the reader. Bonus: He notes when he is ""dry swallowing"" pills as opposed to those he washed down with champagne or single-malt scotch. Some talent.
And the No. 1 reason we can't get behind this Wolf of Wall Street schtick ...
1. Other People Suffered for His Sins¬† It wasn't just the old ladies swindled out of their life savings, although that's bad enough to give this redemption tour a sour taste. He also admits to pushing his wife down the stairs, sexually molesting a female flight attendant and putting his three-year-old daughter in a car without a seatbelt, which he promptly crashed through a garage door. Some things just aren't forgivable.",2014-01-09T01:24:42.000Z,4

Values which recently led to a worldwide financial crisis under which we still are suffering. Im sure Scorsese means well and is comdemning the behavior of the 'wolfs' on wallstreet, but I seriously doubt that the majority of young boys will leave the cinema and think to them self 'that belford guy sure seems like the biggest looser. I dont ever want to be like that'. No the viewers will see a bunch of guys having a blast, spending money, getting late, looking good and walking in slowmotion all without giving a f*** about the consequences. I am not denying that this way of life isn't attractive in the way it is presented by hollywood, but it is never the less an illusion and it is overshadowing the real moral of the movie.",2014-01-03T01:33:48.000Z,3

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"Chimpanzees used in showbiz are terribly abused. They are torn from their mothers at birth, while in the wild they form lifelong family bonds. Breaking this bond causes the exact same distress it would to a human mother and baby. All the chimpanzees and orangutans you see in showbiz are youngsters, as at around the age of 5 they become to strong to handle, so they are discarded to a roadside zoo, or put in a cage for breeding. By this point, they probably have had their teeth knocked out with hammer and chisel. That grin you see on chimpanzees in showbiz is actually an expression they make when they are scared. They are beaten into submission, and housed in terrible conditions between shoots. Even the AHA saying no animals were harmed in the making of the movie means nothing, because A. they do not monitor training, transport or living conditions of the animals and B. they were on set during the making of the Hobbit, where 27 animals died on their watch.
Apes are also critically endangered in the wild, and using them in TV, commercials and movies, and even holiday cards gives the impression they are plentiful.
It also gives people the impression they make good pets, when nothing could be further from the truth. APES ARE NOT GOOD PETS!

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,I'm Christian and I honestly thought the film was great. Yes there was a lot of sex and drugs but it was all necessary to the plot it was all there to give us a view into how corrupt it was back then and how it still is going on now. For anything this film taught us all the things not to do in life and we had the age old lesson which is crime doesn't pay. With Martin Scorsese as the director and great acting from the whole cast I'll be surprised if this film doesn't win at  least one Oscar. ,2014-01-01T19:33:41.000Z,1

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"THE TRASH WOLF OF WALL STREET

I am Swiss, with French origin, ¬†and I do cherish US as much as France and Switzerland. Therefore, I‚Äôll dare to indulge myself with some sarcastic humour concerning something worth trash : the wolf of wall street, in lower case, as it doesn‚Äôt deserve capital letters.

The wolf of wall street indeed breaks a record.
It lasts about 3 hours, or 10800 seconds. This is not the record.
The record is that from the very rich vocabulary used in this so called movie, one word is used close to once a second, i.e. at least 10.000 times. A good candidate for the Guinness book.
This word is nothing like luck, or duck, or buck, but it ends the same and starts with and F. Don‚Äôt ask me more, I forgot this word.
The good thing is that there is another word flowering this picture up, it isn‚Äôt sit, nor pit, neither fit, and not even a bit, again it ends the same and starts with SH.
Here again, I lossed my memory.
Besides that, nothing else as vernacular than blow (not necessarily down), ¬†beach (actually wrong but very close to that with i and t in the middle instead of e and a), cook (or was it cock ?) and masterbed (wrong again , it was masturbate).
That‚Äôs it with the talking.¬†
Pictures : A bunch of true idiots drinking, smoking (no tobacco here), inhaling, pleasuring themselves in all the odd manners you would be more than ashamed of only thinking of.¬†
Besides that, the impressive kind of flesh we saw ¬†in the middle page of our favourite magazines when we were teenagers, ¬†but dressed much less, moving, and fast, and much more creative in terms of positions, style, and dynamics.
The scenario isn‚Äôt as rich as either the vocabulary, or the pictures.
Contrary to a western, here you only have bad guys. So sad‚Ä¶
Wall Street gurus, Swiss bankers, prostitutes, and‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt remember anyone else, sorry, there was nobody else.
Alcohol, drugs, well, not in samples, rivers of scotch and mountains of cocaine, together with the uggly and vulgar side of ¬†the kama sutra. Exactly the opposite of erotic love.
Actually a very good example for our kids, who will end up watching this piece of art thanks to the modern ways of communiCRAPtion. Their opinion on our generation will stay much below belt level.
¬†
Some say you should consider this with a view at the second degree, rather than at the first degree ; believe me, ¬†I tried all the degrees up to the 36th, and still don‚Äôt understand what we do need that pellicula for. It‚Äôs worth the dustbin, nothing more, nothing else, nothing less.

Unfortunately, there were people in the theatre who found that funny.
Unfortunately, there will be people abroad judging this as a reflection ¬†of the american culture.
Unfortunately, there will be people remembering this as the prototype of Wall Street and bankers‚Äôs working principles.
Such a caricature, ¬†should remind us that anything excessive is of no importance because you can‚Äôt give it any credit.
Reality was much more complex, not only consisting in Ponzis and Madoffs,¬†

Leonardo, a name belonging to one of the most prominent human beings of all the ages, da Vinci.
He doesn‚Äôt deserve this language.

Don‚Äôt go to see this movie. If you go, don‚Äôt tell me. If you went. don‚Äôt tell me you liked it.
If you liked it, you can never ¬†be my friend again.
Guys, my memory came back :
what the fucking piece of shit was that crap movie ?¬†",2013-12-29T19:19:41.000Z,2

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"Even though this movie is pushing sarcasm, absurdity and vulgarity to the extreme, it is purposely doing do in order to show a very close portrait of HOW these people think and proceed to get their money, and then expose how¬†they use their money (drug, sex and other absurd spendings) like addicted megalomaniacs with no conscience, ethics or remorse. They lie, trick and manipulate the confidence of people, very often poor/average people (although they also manage to target the 1% richest part of the population) whose hopes to make a little bit more money are used by brokers to get what they want : tangible, real money on commissions, whereas the stock markets sold to the ''muppets'' as they call them is nothing but virtual, extremely volatile and unreliable money. In this sense, this movie is establishing a satiric, yet close to reality portrait of our financial system, its flaws and its absurdities and about how none of these assholes can be trusted.

The movie isn't meant to be seen as a standalone comedic movie. The comedy is a tool which is meant to expose a portrait and transmit a message to the audience on how absurd, yet real¬†this system is. Unfortunately, judging by the comments, quite a few people fail to understand the objective of the movie and decide to¬†judge it only by its vulgarity and comedic value.",2013-12-29T18:48:12.000Z,4

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"It's marvelous that you can produce a picture such as this - but does it have to be marketed as something that represents (represented) the zeitgeist of America? It does NOT; not in any real sense. This is the story about a very select few psychotically greedy bastards who convinced others into helping them with their dreams of avarice. That the American public was taken in by these sociopaths is an indicator of credulousness - not a general attitude of greed. People were made to believe in the companies that these crooks sold based not on a wild-ass gamble, but with the notion that Americans can make something from nothing with a good idea, some money, and a lot of hard work. The left wing will have a field day with this movie, again loudly proclaiming the extremely mistaken notion that Americans are fat, greedy, knuckle-dragging Philistines. How about this notion, Scorcese: Make a fucking movie that shows the world what makes this nation great; you know, the one that took in your ancestors, and with some hard work, talent, and luck allowed you to sit there and make your gangster movies. You have to admit it is painfully easy (regardless of your hard work on this film) to make a movie that shows the dark side of this country - that's all you fucking seem to do! Stop with this shit already! The pump and dump movie has been done; this is a just a bigger budget version of ""Boiler Room"", done 13 years ago with Vin Diesel and Giovanni Ribisi.

Which is somewhat ironic. Last night I met a guy who was adamant that Leo DiCaprio is a shitty actor. Personally, I don't give a shit either way. But...I've seen most movies he's been in....and I must say, the man is a fucking ace actor. He's the best of our generation, to be honest. I first saw him in Romeo + Juliet, back in high school.

That movie was very interesting...but I paid DiCaprio no mind. Titanic made me realize he was a rather good actor...and Catch Me If You Can made me a fan. Since then, he's put out movie after movie....Gangs of New York, Inception, Shutter Island, The Beach, Blood Diamond, The Aviator(need I say more?) etc etc....that is fucking amazing.

This new movie seems to be a classic in the making. I haven't even seen it yet...but it looks like a no-nonsense well-done fucking film. I can't wait.",2013-12-21T01:50:51.000Z,0

2013-06-17T05:40:12.000Z,iszwuX1AK6A,The Wolf of Wall Street Official Trailer,"To whom it may concern,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction towards the Chinese translated name of the captioned movie into ""ËèØÁàæË°óÁãº‰∫∫"" in Hong Kong. To me, I have been to fans of Martin Scorsese and have been waiting for this movie for long time. However, I am very upset and disappointed when the Chinese translated name "" ËèØÁàæË°óÁãº‰∫∫"" was announced in Hong Kong. I do believe in many audience's mind, Áãº‰∫∫ referred to the wolverine performed by Hugh Jackman in Marvel's Heroic movie in Hong Kong and this name leads to confusion to audience that whether the wolverine went to Wall Street for financial investment or not. This truly does not fit the content of Scorsese's movie and not only me believed it is bad taste and I strongly agreed that it will set a potential obstacle for its ticket revenue in Hong Kong and also a possible insult to Mr. Scorsese's Masterpiece. I hope that a offical reply will receive from your side and earnestly hope that your side will translated into much more appropriate and possible name similar to Taiwan ""ËèØÁàæË°ó‰πãÁãº"" in the real promotion campaign for the movie. Thank you so much.

3) Is it a trend for period pieces to have hip hop soundtracks for their trailers? I'm not complaining just an observation
