2016-06-27T12:59:40.000Z,rqmHSR0bFU8,Morgan | Official Trailer [HD] | 20th Century FOX,"in my honest opinion it was a pretty good movie if you have nothing to watch, if you're bored. it's rather simple and has pretty good fight scenes. the 'twist' is glaringly obvious but you can overlook it if you choose to. she's not some mutant or super powered freak, some scenes that the trailer show doesn't even appear in the movie. she's basically a assassin toddler. 

(MINOR SPOILERS)  


my only 'issue' was kinda how gross it was with the whole amy/morgan thing considering morgan WAS five, she just had the body of a teen/young adult. they never showed anything so it wasn't a big deal, but they didn't portray it as a sibling thing and it kinda just was a tad gross in my opinion. but that's ethics, it has nothing to do with the movie. which was like a 6/10 in my opinion. good plot idea, decent fight scenes, obvious plot twist, and slight maybe pedo stuff? tbd",2018-10-30T23:08:33.000Z,0

Premise was intriguing, you have a girl grown in a lab, she is exploring the world and rules around her and then it  wastes everything down the toilet and becomes generic with huge G. 

Actors do a fine job but they're just tools to progress the story and there is nothing interesting about them and at a point you just want to scream at them for being so dumb and making stupid decisions. Girl who plays Morgan did fine but nohing memorable. Movie is choppy and uneventful and it doesn't help that they are in middle of nowhere because the enviroment is not that interesting.

But in the movie, she doesn't even have telekinetic powers. She jumped across the desk and bit a chunk out of his neck. It's one thing to show a scene in a trailer and change it in the movie. It's another thing entirely to show a scene in a trailer that implies that a character has powers, but doesn't have them in the movie. That would be like them showing a trailer for Superman, seeing him fly and lift incredibly large objects with ease, but when you see the movie, you see that he is just a regular man with no powers of flight or strength. This really pisses me off and is VERY misleading. That one scene in the trailer changes the entire structure of the movie.",2016-09-07T05:20:39.000Z,0

It could be as simple as a genetic disorder that their bodies can not create an enzyme that breaks down Hemoglobin.  The subject can be giving the enzyme via injections daily, but this makes sure the subject NEVER can survive outside controlled conditions.

A day is alot of time to do damage, and in truth the body will fail after about a week as the toxic nature of Hemoglobin build up becomes too much for the body to bare.  However this is MUCH more ideal then a new set of untested genetic codes being introduced into the human population.  Yes, her going on a murderous rampage is bad but that will kill at most a few hundred, maybe a thousand or so people, but the damage to the species if she was able to breed with a normal human and give birth is too risky.

Atleast they made the 'subject' female so they could not just go to a bar and get a human pregnant, or worse yet attack and impregnate a dozen or so humans before they where stopped.  Seriously, does no one think to themselves, ""Hey, what happens if we lose control?  I mean we are talking about an intelligent being here so we know they can be hard to control.  Maybe we should have a few dozen layers of fail safes JUST in case.  right guys?""",2016-08-22T01:34:51.000Z,0

It gave the impression that the movie would go in Ex Machinas footsteps, but with a darker twist. This trailer killed that off completely. The whole plot and narration is revealed, which is a generic Hollywood Frankenstein monster where the monster rebels and kills of it's creators and oppressors one by one. Seen it so many times before. Species, Splice... this one is going to be no different. Boring.",2016-06-28T13:09:45.000Z,0
