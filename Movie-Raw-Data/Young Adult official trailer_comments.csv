2011-10-08T05:22:33.000Z,Ar_-v7dEEoo,YOUNG ADULT Trailer 2011 Official [HD],"NOT a comedy. A really really great movie about a woman who has arrested development, depression, is an alcoholic and trichotillomania not to mention is literally delusional. Also about a man who was a victim of a horrible hate crime and was brutally attacked by a bunch of jocks in high school because they thought he was gay. They bashed his penis, his legs, bashed his head so severely he was in the hospital for weeks. Missed 6 months of school (and Mavis being Mavis thought he was so lucky)  So he forever has to walk with a crutch. Many other bad things happen but won‚Äôt spoil the movie. (The most depressing scene is on here if you look up climax of Young Adult)

I do not know why they sort of marketed this as a comedy in any sense of the word!",2019-09-05T03:28:58.000Z,0

2011-10-08T05:22:33.000Z,Ar_-v7dEEoo,YOUNG ADULT Trailer 2011 Official [HD],"While sometimes funny, Young Adult lacks the charm and warmth of Juno. Unrealistic, too. No alcoholic with trichotillomania would look half as good or have half as much hair as Mavis, a sociopath who neglects her devoted dog and caring parents while relentlessly working to destroy a loving family just to satisfy her twisted, delusional desires. Mavis not only clings to her long gone adolescence; she clings to such pure evil that this movie's few humorous moments can't compensate for how unlikable she is. She's as cruel, selfish and uncaring now as she was in high school so we're left wondering what did a great guy like Buddy ever see in her? She's the kind of person who would do the world a favor if she fell down a flight of stairs and broke her neck as everyone, including her dog, would be better off if she was dead. Finally, when there's hope Mavis is motivated to mature into her better self, it's quickly crushed by Matt's sister, Sandra, who's infatuation blinds her to Mavis' many faults. Mavis enthusiastically embraces Sandra's asinine advice to continue being the same (evil) person she's always been. God help anyone like Mavis in real life. Age and alcoholism will quickly ravage the remaining remnants of her physical beauty; the only quality Mavis posseses because she has no heart and no soul.",2019-02-15T07:18:00.000Z,1

Its ok to be flawed, that's being human, so I'm not sure why so many people only find perfect characters ""likeable"" these days :-/  Anyway, acting ""grown-up"" doesn't necessarily make someone better...lots of people who think they're mature are judgmental jerks.  Changing isn't always for the better.  Some people are too serious.  Nothing wrong with staying young at heart...people should be true to themselves, not society's expectations and pressures.

I liked that it was dark and depressing; as movie-going audiences, we have become spoiled by happy endings and the end result is that we suck up good ideas into a black hole (i.e. ""We can't buy your script because it doesn't cater to everyone else"") because we want the same thing over and over.

2011-10-08T05:22:33.000Z,Ar_-v7dEEoo,YOUNG ADULT Trailer 2011 Official [HD],"@senorBiRico - I've liked all of Jason Reitman's films, and I think he and Diablo Cody work great together!  You're spot on, when it comes to Ellen Page in ""Juno"".  But we're definitely dealing with an anti-hero, in regards to Theron's character.  Reitman stated that ""Young Adult"" is possibly ""my most dislikable film ever""; but he was referencing our protagonist in the film.  There are plenty of masterpieces made with dislikable protagonists, but we still identify with them.",2011-10-10T06:06:32.000Z,0

In every scene, her presentation of her lines and facial expressions just fall flat. She has zero charisma. She looks as dry and dead as she appears in this film. I wonder why she took this role",2011-10-08T19:58:24.000Z,0
