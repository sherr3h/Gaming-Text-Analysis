I didn't realize it was about [SPOILER ALTERT] Metroman quitting the hero game, Megamind becoming bored with victory, a new villain arising and Megamind becoming the new hero [END SPOILER]
Come to think of it, this movie came out around the same time that Mark Waid's comic series ""Irredeemable"" and ""Incorruptible"", the former focusing on a superhero suddenly beginning to slaughter the population of earth, and the latter following said hero's super-villain nemesis turning to the good side. I very well might have confused ""Megamind"" and ""Irredemable"" while reading side-by-side reviews of them, or something (I was only about 12 when all this happened).",2019-02-26T04:07:59.000Z,0

The characters are really moving and the close emotional moments are very well done. Is a good follow up to Up, Legend of the Guardians, 9 & Despicable Me. Animation has gotten a lot better at graphics, characters, & story lines since Looking For Nemo & Beauwolf, still crap like that annoying Hamsters movie still gets done but quality over all is improving for sure.
