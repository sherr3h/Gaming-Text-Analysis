2009-12-25T07:08:13.000Z,HHhtFIF9VSg,TinkerBell and The Great Fairy Rescue - Official Trailer #1,"I saw this recently for review purposes, and it is utterly different (save for the action sequences). It's like they lost the bottle to have any real conflict, and went with the under-5s storyline.

2009-12-25T07:08:13.000Z,HHhtFIF9VSg,TinkerBell and The Great Fairy Rescue - Official Trailer #1,"i hate how they completely chaned the story...this was the trailer that premiered on The Lost Treasure. then they said Vidia got caught and Tink had to save her. Now the little girl is a sweet girl who loves fairies, as opposed to the mean girl keeping the fairy in a jar. How many times are they going to change the story? Geez. But it seems since it's close to the release date, that the sweet little girl playing nice with Tink is the story now.",2010-08-11T02:07:33.000Z,1
