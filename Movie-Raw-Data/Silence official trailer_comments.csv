Talk about subjective... You could just as easily make a Japanese version of the film describing how their ancestors successfully prevented a hostile foreign religion from taking hold where it had managed to destroy every nation-culture in it's path until then. Today, Japan is not christian thanks to the actions of their forebears... otherwise their identity and people would have suffered the same fate as too many others. I only wish more countries had succeeded like they did, so they wouldn't be the soulless, identity-less empty-shells they are today. Christianity destroyed so much around the world and the consequences of this are sadly still so palpable today. :(",2017-02-19T21:15:48.000Z,0

Main stream Hollywood loves to portray the Gospel from an evil perspective.  Even if the Catholic Church (of which I am not a member) has some egregious sins in its past, they have done amazing good in the world as a whole.  If we were to weigh on a scale all the incredible and wonderful things Catholics have done with the horrible things, the scale would be overwhelmingly positive and beautiful.  Just because the ""world"" or Hollywood wants to focus on the evil done, doesn't make it historically accurate on the whole.

Millions upon millions have been persecuted and martyred for their faith including the founder himself- Jesus. The fact that there are over 250,000,000 Christians in the U.S alone should give a good enough reason to make movies based on Christian history no?

While those roles made them famous it's roles like the ones they portray in silence that really push them as actors and the whole point of being a great actor is to try and do roles that are completely outside ones comfort zone. Sure a movie about two Portuguese Jesuit priests who try to locate their mentor in Japan who has abandoned his faith but while trying to locate him in Japan they spread the word of Christianity to the Japanese people but face all kinds of torture and brutality due to the fact Christians and Christianity have been driven underground.And the Japanese are trying get these hidden Christians to reveal themselves and to renounce their faith by using methods, such as having them walk over crudely painted images of Christ known in Japanese as ""fumie "" once and for all or if not face death may be a little too heavy for some people who are not used to movies that question could i die for my faith, or could i renounce my faith to save others. or is redemption possible, well simple don't watch the movie stick to watching movies about superheros brooding around beating each other up in tight spandex.
