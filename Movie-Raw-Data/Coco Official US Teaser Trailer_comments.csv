They spend 7 years doing this, and as a Mexican I can say I never seen a movie more close to our traditions than this one. 
If you had someone pass out recently like your grandma o any family member, you will cry as child. I dont want to say that is more sadly than Toy Story 3, depends of who is watching, but if you are like me and you miss your Grandma, is impossible to dont love this movie. The message in this movie is more deep and important than in any other pixar movie.

They watch ""Book of Life"" everyday, but my problem is that it's not a good movie. I have no Latin blood but even I could tell it was Americanising what should be an authentic piece of cultural art. Outside of visuals, I have very few good things to say about that movie.
This movie looks like it will truly honor their heritage, and not rely on American celebrities giving stupid fake accents or no accents at all, and pathetic pop songs that really have no place in the world their going for. 
I have faith in Lee Unkrich, and it's really not fair to say this film is a blatant rip off when it could be improving on the ideas ""Book of Life"" had. At least see the movie first before critisizing. This could be like how ""Inside Out"" was ""Herman's Head"" and ""Osmosis Jones"" done right.
I am buying tickets to the premiere and taking both of them, we will be in the best seats in the house and I trust Pixar to treat them like people, or at least better than a certain world leader.",2017-06-09T04:40:31.000Z,0

2017-06-07T23:30:01.000Z,xlnPHQ3TLX8,Coco - Official US Trailer,"ok so i have to vent this out. Coco is not ripping off the book of life. Pixar announced the making of this film years ago. There has been a history of pixar movies and other movies being undoubtedly similar (ants vs a bugs life anyone) In fact, a pixar film called ""Newts"" was cancelled and im pretty sure it had something to do with the fact it was so similar to Rio. I dont personally believe this has ever pixar's fault, and lets face it, of any similar movies pixar's has always been on top. You could see other companies take on the film, like it, see pixars and forget the other one even existed bc their movies are true art at their finest (lets not bring up cars 2). People claim that pixar copies other movies because they come out after the other movie. However, pixar spends an unimaginable amount of time on their films. It might take them months and months to create one scene and then redo it because they thought of something better. If you are a pixar theorist like me, you also know they think things through. Like its crazy the way pixar works if the pixar theory by jon negroni is true. Easter eggs are well arranged as is how the story contributes to the pixar timeline. Now, i liked the book of life, dont get me wrong. Maybe we should enjoy having two wonderful films, even if theyre similar. All im saying is lets keep an open mind about coco and not criticize pixar. üòÄ sorry for writing so much",2017-06-08T20:20:33.000Z,522

I was a Lighting and Compositing artist on TBoL and am friends with its director, Jorge.
While I can't speak for him, or any of the other cast and crew of the film, I can say that seeing this trailer makes me excited and proud.

The entire point of Jorge making that film was to share with a larger audience the beauty of a culture that was so important to him.  Disney/Pixar making a film about this subject will only continue that legacy.",2017-06-08T16:15:01.000Z,0
