That said, the Banks did the exact same thing themselves once they realised the economy was failing (getting the dodgy investments off their books) and in the end the people that paid for the crash were ordinary working people and the taxpayers that had to bailout the banks. And then once the government effectively owned the banks, it let them continue running the bureucracy, despite them being completely inept (foreclosing wrong houses, mis-signing peperwork) and foreclosing wherever they could, ruining people's livelihoods. It's a disgrace, the system should never have got to this point but we were told credit was wealth and that the market would keep going up.

Ryan Gosling's character/face annoyed me, and those three supporting random dudes, and Steve Carrel annoying as well. 
If you like 'wall st' type movies....watch Trading Places, Wall Street, Boiler Room, Rogue Trader, Other People's Money,
All finance/wall st movies ....the characters come off as reptile annoying snakes.
All I saw in this movie were a bunch of male actors acting empty...not really convincing or selling or understanding the underlying story.
Gordon Gekko/Michael Douglas is the only guy who can truly sell in a finance/money/wall st movie....he looks and truly acts like he understands that world of finance.",2018-10-20T00:35:03.000Z,0

Everything in this movie is accurate except for the part where the guy played by Steve Carell gets upset because millions lost their jobs and the economy went to shits. Looking for work, I met with a hedge fund guy I knew from a few years back who had personally made over 100m (lord knows how many billions his company made) from short selling pretty much the entire housing market and the entire NYSE. He was high on cocaine and was wouldn't stop complaining to me that Gulfstream were delaying the delivery of his brand new private jet due to setbacks. They couldn't care less about the economy or people losing their jobs, all this dick cared about was his private jet amid the chaos. At my peak I was making 200k a year, this jag off had just made 100 million dollars personally and told me to go fuck myself. It made me so mad I threw his cocaine off his scarface-themed glass table and his personal bodyguard (only major jag offs have bodyguards) kicked me out. It was a rough year but then fortunately, Goldman Sachs had bribed enough politicians by giving them millions for making 2 minute speeches that Congress actually bailed the fuckers out by giving them taxpayer money. If my boss had ""donated"" enough money to those crooks in Washington, Lehman would be trading today. They hired me, I worked for a year and quit because I didn't want to see myself become that hedge fund fucker.",2017-06-24T13:53:51.000Z,0

First the banksters invented and pushed toxic mortgage programs that were destined, if not designed, to fail or require costly refinances setting up a self-perpetuating cycle of even more fees. Examples were interest only, negative amortization, no tax and insurance escrows, no qualifying, and teaser low beginning interest rates - all promoted with a wink and a nod:  ‚ÄúDon't worry, if it gets tough, we'll just refinance you into another lower rate.""  Unsuspecting borrowers pushed to the bankster/realtor controlled lender and title company had no one to look out for their interest.  They believed the sales pitch and signed up.  An inherently dangerous product was sold to the public as safe - much like the unsafe-at-any-speed Chevrolet Corvair.  Evidence now suggests that a majority of the sub-prime loans were made to people who would have qualified for a decent loan but were pushed into the more-profitable, but toxic, sub-prime. 

Second, the banksters packaged this garbage into bonds, paid for a AAA rating, then sold the stinking poo to unsuspecting investors while retaining the lucrative servicing rights and senior positions for themselves. 

Third, the banksters developed a scheme (MERS) that was supposed to keep track of the swirl of paperwork as they whipped these loans and bonds around the world while defrauding local courts of millions of dollars in transfer taxes. Talk about tax evasion!

Lastly, when the whole thing unravels, the banksters have lost the paperwork, don't know who owns what, can't understand how it all went so wrong and won't negotiate to help people keep their homes.",2017-01-03T04:44:53.000Z,0

Coincidentally, it reminded me a of a conversation I had with a client back in January of 2007. He came in one day to let me know he was cancelling his membership with a business I own because he was moving to Mexico. I gave the usual platitudes and asked him what prompted the move. He said he was selling all of his rental properties and retiring with his family to somewhere in Mexico. Since he was only in his mid-30's I congratulated him and wished him luck. At the time I didn't think anything else of it but, in hindsight, it's obvious he saw what was coming. Regardless of whether the government or banks caused the crash the real tragedy was the apparently obvious warning indicators but the people who mattered decided to ignore them.",2016-11-25T11:29:01.000Z,0

People should be more scared. Before niclear weapons wars were everywhre but it was all fine and dandy. They should be scared and do less mistekes cua if the trigger is pulled once its all over.

I also nominate it for WORST drumming in film history by an actor. I'm in shock there was a drumming coach. Somebody got ripped off. He's playing the Mastodon song at half speed, and at the kit, it's technically correct, but it looks REALLY, REALLY bad. Extremely ham-handed, like he's wearing boxing gloves. 

MUCH better drumming in The Rocker and The Gene Krupa Story. 

So is Scott Wittenberg a really bad teacher, or is the actor just not listening? I'm going with bad teaching.  Any new drummer should know how to find the tempo with the snare and not to play like you're in a body cast. 90+% of that is just loosen up your hands and body. You don't need to be tense, it just makes the drums sound like crap. I learned that from Bernard Purdie (Steely Dan) and watching the hands of some of the best players in existence. 

I was so distracted by the awful sounding drums, I didn't even notice what they were, or if they were even tuned. I think Evans heads makes them sound like garbage, but I'm sure sound guys love them because they're flat as hell. Not many overtones to have to fight with.",2016-10-21T14:09:10.000Z,0

If what he says is true, all of this started thanks to Lewis Ranieri, an investment banker at the old Salomon Brothers, who dreamed up the idea of buying mortgages from bank lenders, bundling them and issuing bonds with the bundles as collateral. The monthly payments from homeowners were used to pay interest on the bonds, and principal was repaid once all the mortgages had been paid down or refinanced.

However after reflecting on it, the characters that are supposed to be heroes really are not. A small group of guys discovered the fraud and toxicity of these assets but only sought to make there own profit from it. They could have done many things to alert the public, regulators, politicians, media. But they, in the end made millions off it. I don't think they're any better than the bankers and rating agencies that caused the problem (and many others). But the movie tricks you, or at least it did me, into rooting for them. According to the movie, the one character, Mark Baum, made some weak attempts, perhaps the book better describes this, at talking to the media and the rating agencies. But if they all had put as much energy into warning everyone as they did making money off it, I'm sure there voices would have eventually made a difference. Its very interesting how the movie portrays them as heroes. I totally bought it. Fortunately I can still think after the movie.",2016-01-29T18:35:04.000Z,0

We are two adults.
Okay.
We would like to see a film for adults. Not the X rated kind.
Okay. Anything in particular that the adults like?
Serious and funny.
Serious AND funny?
Yes.
I would not suggest Alvin and the Chipmunks. Have you seen the new Star Wars movie?
No. Is it serious and funny?
Not really. And there were a lot of children.
Any other suggestions?
I would recommend The Big Short. The only people who have bought tickets to this movie were definitely adults.
If it is based on the book I read several years back, then we are definitely interested. When is the first showing?
1:15 today. It also has been very well reviewed. 
Thank you.

Outstanding performance by everyone, great pacing, well done ending, smart script, superb plot, no con (seriously NO CON i can think of).

Just remember it was the federal government that passed legislation requiring the banks to make loans they would otherwise not have made, all in the interest of ""helping"" people get into houses they couldn't afford. The banks happily went along with it because the federal government GUARANTEED those loans with PUBLIC MONEY.  The fact that these ridiculous loans were undersigned by the general public via the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT in the event of a collapse is what fueled the ""greed"" - making it possible for banks to hand out loans like candy, repackage and sell those loans by virtue of a FULL ASSURANCE OF THEIR SOLVENCY BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, and make a killing for them AND THEIR CRONIES IN POLITICS in the process. 

Of course the whole thing had to come crashing down, but blaming it merely on the ""greed"" of the banks is a great way for us to do it all again. FOR THE WHOLE PROCESS CONTINUES. The Federal Reserve is corrupt. The government ""management"" of the economy is corrupt. We are in another bubble RIGHT NOW due to the government artificially inflating a bubble via their manipulation of our currency. It is NOT more regulation that is needed - it is a TRUE FREE MARKET removed from the machinations of government, wherein money is treated like any other good or service and banks must be responsible for the loans they make - NOT GUARANTEED A government handout! (Also, fraud is fraud and is always prosecutable- which is a process that is more transparent and effective in a TRUE FREE MARKET.)

THIS PROBLEM STARTS WITH OUR GOVERNMENT. If people do not see the proper cause-and-effect then we have learned NOTHING from the recent economic meltdown and will be destined to repeat it again and again, each time shaking our heads like children about ""greed"" when we continually fail to see the real source of the problem.

One more thing. It wasn't just a guy who ""gets his hair cut at supercuts and doesn't wear shoes"" who could see the collapse coming- IT WAS THE ENTIRE SCHOOL OF AUSTRIAN ECONOMISTS. Only these are NOT the economists in power. The Austrian school promotes a fair and prosperous system, not the sort of currency manipulation and devious legislation beloved by the politicians and their crony capitalist partners who run the show and have an utter disdain for the common person.

A good primer on the events covered in this movie is Tom Wood's book ""Meltdown.""  The American people need to wake up to the fraud that is the COLLUSION between government and big banks, bankers should be prosecuted, nefarious legislation limiting the proper functioning of the market removed, economically ignorant, greedy politicians should be replaced and the Federal Reserve should be dealt with. 

I hope this film reveals at least some of the actual dynamics at work to create this crisis, but I doubt it will. The scumbags who have created this mess are able to continue in power in part by their control of the media. They have had an overwhelming influence in shaping public opinion on this, getting the average person to attribute our economic woes to ""greedy bankers"" and a ""lack of legislation"" - and thereby escaping the corrections that would jeopardize their power!",2015-09-23T22:21:16.000Z,167

The Housing Bubble in 4 Easy Steps
SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 Mark Thornton

1. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to as low as 1% so that after inflation we had negative interest rates.

2. As a result, mortgage rates fell to an all time low.

3. Low rates caused borrowing and lending to explode, particularly in real estate. For example, commercial banks more than doubled the amount of real-estate loans they made.

4. All these low interest loans had to be extended to people with worse credit ratings and this increased the demand for homes and other real-estate assets. It should not be surprising that home prices skyrocketed. Click on the link below to the Real Estate Roller Coaster:

Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, mortgage-backed securities, and credit derivatives were simply the conduit that made all these bad loans and investments seem less risky than they really were. In this manner the Federal Reserve can fool the market, at least temporarily. In the end the market always reasserts itself.

Next up, the higher education bubble and the stock market over-evaluation. I expect they'll blame those collapses on ""human greed"" too.",2015-09-22T19:24:07.000Z,14

Then, do a film on all those who saw it coming, from Ron Paul, Martin Armstrong (a great docu, the *_FORECASTER_* which you, Hollyweird, wouldn't even dare distribute), Marc Faber, Paul Craig Roberts, Gerald Celente, Peter Schiff, Mike Maloney, Robert Kiyosaki, et al.
