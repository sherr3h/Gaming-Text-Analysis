2012-06-01T21:53:06.000Z,IuEFm84s4oI,Les Miserables - Official Movie Trailer 2012 (HD),"People doesn't have any idea how fucked up the movie was compare to what could have been if the casting were sincere and the cinematography were honest. First, Danny Cohen obviously were concern if they didn't closed up much, it'll look like they're just lip syncing, but it shouldn't have to be THAT close. C'mon! Now, with the casting choice. Dear Lord, who was the casting agent!? Of all the major roles, only 4 were commendable. It's Hugh, Aaron, Amanda, and Anne, though I still have issues with Amanda and Anne but still. To whom should I ever begin? Sam Barks. She could blow you away with her voice but girlfriend, you can't act. Nope, not even close. Ed Redymane. Many people are still being fooled by his singing prowess. It's not that great. It might be good, but it's not that great. Stop whispering, and stop your stupid blank face dude! Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. My respect and adoration are with these two, but how they butchered the role. It's the only part of the show that the casts and audiences are allowed to smile, laugh, and jive with the melody. But what happened? They make it like a scene in Sweeney Todd, it's creepy! And last, but DEFINITELY not the least. Russell Crowe. Russell Fucking Crowe. You could have Norm Lewis or, or even Harry Connick, Jr. But no, we have to choose someone who knows musicals so much that he ignored every key and went straight to the FLAT Island. To be honest, when the movie version were announced, I was just a student. I saved so much so that I could avail the ticket, and by the grace of God I did. I even had enough that I can watch it again. But when the casts were announced, and then the movie were out. What a was of effort, and time, not to mention money. Good thing though, Django Unchained was also out that day, I watched it and Good Lord, bless Quentin Tarantino. If I were gonna make the cast, it'll be:


Hugh Jackman as Valjean
Norm Lewis as Javert
Anne Hathaway as Fantine
Amanda Seyfried as Cosette
John Lloyd Young as Marius
Aaron Tveit as Enjolras
Lea Michele as Eponine
Neil Patrick Harris as Thenardier
Kristin Chenoweth as Madame Thenardier",2017-08-11T17:09:57.000Z,0

I'd be honored if Les Mis fans would consider taking a look at my new book, Wolves and Urchins: The Early Life of Inspector Javert. It's an examination of Javert's life from his birth in a prison until the point where he reunites with Valjean in Montreuil-sur-Mer in 1823. Thanks for the great performance!

2012-06-01T21:53:06.000Z,IuEFm84s4oI,Les Miserables - Official Movie Trailer 2012 (HD),"This is about as musical as it gets. Nearly every word is sung and those that aren't are still part of the music.
However, there are no dance numbers - which is not so say there isn't choreography, it just happens to be naturalistic.
It is a pretty amazing musical - though the film doesn't capture the emotion as well as stage for some reason. It is epic and despite the fact that no character finishes in a better place than they've been previously, the audience is left feeling triumphant.

Victor Hugo didn't write any of the music or the songs, it wouldn't be fair to credit him with the music. Surely the storyline came from his novel, but that is to be credited when you watch the musical because the musical is written BASED ON the novel. You can say that the movie is adapted from the musical created in 1980 in which the STORY is based on the novel written in 1862.

They did not prerecord anything, but clearly they did multiple takes as this trailer's version is simply not in the movie. And editing is not the issue as that does not make changes to specific moments. No, this is a different performance of the song than is in the movie. If you wish to hear what I mean just go to the soundtrack here at YT and compare.  Not even similar, and much less moving than what we hear in this trailer.

It worked very well here. There is emotion but there is also the song. In the movie she was off-key and often dropped the song altogether. Certainly worse singing. We know, however, that she could sing very emotionally as that is what we are hearing in this trailer. What we get in the movie is acting, not singing.

The take used in the movie is very, very different. Here we hear strong emotion but can still hear the song. In the movie the song is entirely lost in all the crying, gasping and mumbling.

They failed and the characters & their dreams are crushed by the cruel and brutal world around them. But in the end the spirit of hope and defiance lives on in the final moving scene. That was the magic of Victor Hugo's story telling. ,2012-12-30T03:55:56.000Z,0

Musically, the parts sung by Enjolras (he was great), Eponine and Gavroche stood out most for me. 

Personally I feel that they could have done a bigger, better job on the movie. There are many advantages a movie has over a stage production and I felt that the movie did not take full advantage of them. But the plot and musical score of Les Miserables is so fantastic that it frankly makes any average rendition phenomenal anyway. Despite the many rotten bits, the movie has its spark.",2012-12-29T15:58:59.000Z,0

Helena and Sacha in 'Master of the House') but sometimes the cutting of the movie was annoying...there were too many close ups! However, the close ups does help connect the audience with the characters.

The singing for most of the leads was average. Not phenomenal, but pretty good for actors. The great acting (Anne Hathaway & pretty much everyone else) balanced it out.

Our nations existence was tenuous at best and at constant threat from a second invasion (1812) plus there were some drastic character issues with our founding fathers and the French fathers of the revolution regarding how they deal with dissidents. Also this is in no way a premise of our strength over another nations as was inferred. Its a story.,2012-12-25T07:17:21.000Z,0

And don't forget Brokeback Mountain, even thought she played a minor role, she sold the character pretty well.

Ann sang this song in a way that it would set the mood for the movie, it would not make sense for her to sing it without sounding sad. You might then mention some of the artists that have sang this in a stage production but you can't compare a movie to the stage because on stage it must be over the top in order to be appreciated. Look for other instences when Ann is singing and you will see how great she can truly sing. ",2012-11-30T09:52:14.000Z,0

Nothing against Anne, but Fantine is the quintessential female mega-role for a production of this caliber. Hathaway, in no extent of the phrase, is vocally skilled enough to do this part justice. I'm certain her acting will be spot on, but I just hope I'm not cringing in the theatre with the thought of how much better her part could be sung.

The film gives an unique opportunity to do Les Miserables where actors and actresses are allowed to focus more on acting than singing. It is impossible to be done in theater because that's not what audience go there to see. Likewise doing film version in theater-style will be equally odd.

So what matters they are singing to microphone? They did it as realistically as possible and I know for two facts that the outcome is fantastic and it can not be done any other way.",2012-10-31T10:39:20.000Z,0

I find it strange for Anne to say that 'there is something selfish about going for the pretty version' considering that the songs are central to the story. It is important to sing the songs as beautifully and emotionally as one possibly can.  An 'ugly version' labeled as a 'more realistic' interpretation is a WEAKNESS. ",2012-10-02T12:56:34.000Z,0

2012-06-01T21:53:06.000Z,IuEFm84s4oI,Les Miserables - Official Movie Trailer 2012 (HD),Musicals are very difficult to sell to a film audience- For example watch the trailer for Phantom (the film)- no one actually sings! Les Mis to it's credit is letting people know there will be singing and we have a person on screen actually singing. As it stands this the most famous Les Mis song to people who perhaps haven't seen the show.  You have to give a cinema going audience who aren't theatre goers something familiar. Also remember the film wasn't finished at this point.,2012-09-09T12:24:06.000Z,0

While the experience of a stage show is exciting and energetic, a stage singer must project to the back of the theatre so exuberance, joy, anger, sadness all sound pretty much the same.  A film director is more intimate with the actors and has the opportunity to capture higher emotion.  Can't wait to see this one!",2012-08-20T17:54:39.000Z,0

Obviously for the movie they wanted something different in order to portray Fantine's emotion. To be honest, - although I love Lea and Patti - I think this softer version is just as impactful.

She's not as good as some others, granted, but she can pack in a lot more emotion than other singers that have played this role before her could. I think that's what the directors are looking for in this movie. They want people who can sing well, but, more importantly, can bring emotion into the story.",2012-06-15T16:02:11.000Z,0

Remember that Anne Hathaway is not professionally trained. It could have been a lot worse. Besides she did a fantastic job in reflecting the pain that the Fantine is having. I don't always get that emotional during the stage production. They need A-List celebrities to bring in viewers that would not normally see a musical. Duh! Give Anne a break!

Cameron Mackintosh has produced this show many times before and he is an integral part of this movie so he wouldn't let people that were awful participate.
