Then to be a gay black male is 10 times worse. Into the black community we‚Äôre to to be and act a certain way .. to be masculine and straight and strong and if we‚Äôre not we‚Äôre wrong. This movie shows the struggle of finding ones self as a gay black male and struggling to fit in.,2019-11-06T06:18:04.000Z,0

I have to say that I am 1 and 2 but my life was already lonely and scared. I can see myself in Chiron. don't want to go to school + walking with my head down all the time + week at conversation just say some words + often go to the beach alone when I am not OK ...  feel the same way as Chiron does. :(  ... Now I am a grown up man but I still dont have any dates. kisses or even a touch. I am too scared to go outside and make friends. 
How can Chiron stand with all 5 :( ???? I cannot imagine it. How tough his life is ! It's like every road leads him to be social evils.
Sorry for my bad English. I am not an native English speaker. I highly recommend this movie and it deserves the Oscar.
Thank you all who made the movie. It makes me feel comforted.",2019-03-23T14:12:09.000Z,22

But as time went by, and the more I thought about it; the more I began to appreciate it. This movie isn't good solely because the main character is a black gay man; this movie is good because of how it was structured compared to most Hollywood films. Like Quentin Tarantino, and Stanley Kubrick before him, Barry Jenkins offered an entirely different three-act structure that exploits the life of Chiron; with each act basically telling its own story. I believe films like Moonlight will gain an impact to film scholars the same way Pulp Fiction and 2001 did. My only problem with this movie is that the third act dragged a bit longer than the other two; but overall, I now understand why Moonlight is a Best Picture winner.",2018-08-09T03:30:53.000Z,8

I am a white male and cannot say what they go through what so ever but I grew up in the harshest neighborhood and wouldn‚Äôt wish it upon my worst enemy. I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs even like as a black man but I have gotten my ass beat out of me by a bunch of black people in that neighborhood just because I am white and I will never stop fighting for equality because their color didn‚Äôt beat me. Their souls beat me just like the soul of a white man or Latino could have. Yes their anger because of what my color represents is what drive them to do so but it only fuels more anger and rage and the war amongst race and someday men of all ethnicity‚Äôs are going to have to say enough is enough.

I was not a huge fan of this movie when I saw it. I like the idea of a gay African-American growing up in the ghetto and while there were a few scenes that I liked, I didn't really think that the story was heading anywhere and I almost fell asleep a few times. I don't mind that it beat La La Land, but there were just other movies that I enjoyed so much more than this. I get the message of it but I don't really remember what it was. I only think this film won because the Academy felt bad about what they did last year. Please don't attack me with words, I'm just a guy expressing his opinion and I respect all of your opinions. If you don't respect mine, then I actually really don't care. It just feels good to get this off my chest.",2017-05-17T02:44:01.000Z,0

Moonlight won the best - and it completelyyyyyyyy deserves it
It's NOT political film in normal sense; instead of focusing on trying to say ""Black lives matter"", they put a focus on the human-ness, the 'realness' of these people,
and try not to say ok they need rights - because in the end, it's true, they are humans like us, they are not ""just blacks"" but also ""normal human""

And it's not gay movie. It's just about growing up with forgiveness, love and pride - about different facades of character (for example, Chiron as hardcore drug dealer, but before the ending scene ___ (I don't wanna spoil you) etc)

And also it's very poetical - all the frames and effects and design contain meanings of their own and not just beautiful decorations.

This movie wasn't even made to proudly present the gay community. It just showed what it is to have a bad childhood, regardless of your skin color, and living with a drug addict parent and being bullied in school. I didn't see the kid being bullied because he's gay or because he's black, neither did I see it has a point of how hard it is to be gay.

The only part was the kissing moment which I didn't even know if it lasted a full one minute. And then in the end, the two men met at the restaurant and it was so awkward that I didn't even know what was going on lol.

Why is ""Moonlight"" in the top of the ""Best Movies Ever""?! And even winning the Oscars?! And the worst of all, comparing it with truly masterpieces as ""The Godfather""?!

I'm not an homophobic, however I could tell you that it is SO BORING, SO DULL, SO SLOW and many other negative adjectives. But what I hated is that it wasn't even barely compared with 'the Afraican Americans' in the country, it's just adding hipotetical-fantasy situations.

The movie was boring, and nauseating with its endless camera turns and jump cuts. It's not like I got lost-- I knew what was going on at every moment and the movie was predictable as shit-- it just hurt to watch. The camera was irritatingly jumpy, even in scenes without action, and I know _why_ they shot it like that; but I think the movie would've felt just as dramatic without the blatantly documentary-ish effects.¬†In my opinion, this movie was no different or groundbreaking than ""Precious"" or ""Coach Carter"" or ""Training Day"", or any other successful film that focused on people of color. In fact, the only question I ended up asking myself wasn't, ""Why did it win best picture?"" Rather, I asked myself why it won¬†_any_¬†awards at all. It's just a recycled trope and story that's been adapted a thousand times over. Every year a movie like this comes out and every year it wins a truck full of rewards, for no legitimate reason besides ""oh look, it's an all-black cast""!¬†If I didn't know it was award winning, I would've thought it was an independent, b-movie film. The only interesting element was seeing Chiron's interaction with the kid and realising the endless cycle it created. But again, this has been done¬†_to death_. Overall, I'd give this movie a 5/10.

Sure the story was good and the poor kid had a horrible life but this did not deserve best picture. Just my opinion of course.
Lala land was WAY better and even the movie Lion was better.

I have a few things I would switch around every year when it comes to these things. For example, Spotlight won last year. And although it was awesome, I felt the best motion picture of 2016 was Sicario, and it wasn't even nominated (Steve Jobs was probably my second choice). Mark Ruffalo should've snagged Best Supporting. I don't get too upset about these things because it more to it then just the film itself. And more often than not, all of the ones picked deserves to be nominated, no matter who wins.",2017-03-04T01:02:55.000Z,47

I don't feel like any of the themes were particularly explored deeply enough and i am especially disappointed that the two shining characters in the movie in my opinion (Mahershala Ali's character and Janelle Monae's character) were not in the third part of the film. It definitely wasn't a bad movie but personally I don't quite understand how it won best picture. someone please fill in the gaps for me because I would love to understand the beauty of this film a little better!,2017-03-01T22:49:10.000Z,3

2016-08-11T15:00:01.000Z,9NJj12tJzqc,Moonlight | Official Trailer HD | A24,So I finally watch this film and I really don't see what the big deal was. Spoilers Mahershala Ali was not through the whole film first of all. I'm baffled why he was nominated for the Oscar in the first place with this performance. He is a good actor yes but was this an oscar-worthy performance no. Same thing with Manchester by the sea. I don't understand why Casey Affleck got the Oscar his performance was average and he should not have beaten Denzel Washington. The storyline for Manchester by the sea was okay but I did not see an oscar-worthy performance by Casey Affleck. Anyway back to Moonlight I did not see the big deal about this movie I don't understand why it won best picture and I don't know why Mahershala Ali  got an Oscar for his very small performance that did not leave a big impact in this movie truthfully. The only oscar-worthy performance I did see in this movie was by the crack head mother.,2017-03-01T20:32:44.000Z,1

It's well directed and great acting, but best picture worthy? Hell no, la la land, arrival, lion, and almost all the others had either riveting stories that were new and exciting and grasping, or reviving an outdated genre with production and directing.

You guys just can't stand to see black people achieving anything. To be honest with you, La La Land was kind of overrated. Everyone was talking about them, saying how good they were, when really it was just mediocre acting. At least, in my opinion. Moonlight was hardly ever mentioned compared to La La Land, yet there was a hidden beauty about it. But everyone always goes for the typical, romantic shit. Sure the movie idea is original, but the concept is the same, just like with every musical. There's a guy, a girl, like to sing and dance, eventually falls in love. Typical. Moonlight highlighted struggles in two very different communities. The gay community and the black community. It is a struggle for gays in this day and age just as it is, but when it comes to black gays, it seems like there is extra criticism from everybody, especially the black community. We see gays as somewhat aliens. And a lot of black gay men go through struggles and hardships like the ones depicted in this movie. Emma Stone was right when she said this is ""the best movie ever"". It deserved all of the awards that it, and its actors received. So all you white people, and haters need to chill. Maybe see things from other peoples point of view, you just mad because this isn't the typical shit you're used to seeing, open your eyes a little.",2017-03-01T03:08:29.000Z,3

Since i saw the trailer i wanted to watch it in that exact moment. It's poetic. They only invested 1.5 million on the entire movie. it didnt have millions of dollars on production. And yes, i was kind of mad when people started to complain about the fact that this movie won. They haven't even watched it yet, they don't know how AMAZING this film is. They are not used to see a winner that didnt have the super production, the pretty girl and the handsome boy. This is a powerful message above it all. This is a background of what Many people has and is suffering. This is pure art. And i couldnt be any more thankful to all of the people who make this amazing movie.",2017-02-27T20:15:00.000Z,30

 ... i wonder if we need to set minimal standards for how a film is picked for the oscsrs. this film was made for 1.5m and grossed at 25m world wide for a profit of around 22.25 m (mojo numbers ...ask them about the math) avg about 2.5 m saw the film world wide

last year sucked for film quality  unless you like comic books and cartoons, id like to see some standards of a minume box office in profit and attendance before you can be qualified for an oscar... i think that would make quality film much better that way there is a public wallet vote on films like this... there just were not many people that saw this film ... why should it be in contention

also 1.5m dollar budget... come on, really... i bet casey niestat spends that in a week just to make YT Videos everyday

i just dont think this should have been considered as the top spot of the academy....nothing against the message... ...its the scale of the film that i take issue with... very little $$$ to make, small $$$ profit, and few people saw the film...how is that in the same league as independence day retreaded.... opps okay bad example....haha",2017-02-27T17:16:07.000Z,0

2016-08-11T15:00:01.000Z,9NJj12tJzqc,Moonlight | Official Trailer HD | A24,I love the film and the issue of homosexuality was a small part to be discussed. The real issue was clearly the destruction of the black child in the ghetto. Hardships make for hard lives and hard lives result in poor decision making and heartache. That was my take on what I was watching. Deep film once you peel back the layers beyond the obvious.,2017-02-27T16:17:45.000Z,0
2016-08-11T15:00:01.000Z,9NJj12tJzqc,Moonlight | Official Trailer HD | A24,"I do want to understand even though I will not be watching.  Understanding is key for me.  I found comments in this review helpful:  To insist that stories about poor, oppressed or otherwise marginal groups of people are really about everyone can be a way of denying their specificity. The universe is far too granular and far too vast for any one of us to comprehend, and Mr. Jenkins is far too disciplined a filmmaker to turn his characters into symbols.

He does not generalize. He empathizes.  

And perhaps the most beautiful thing about ‚ÄúMoonlight‚Äù is its open-endedness, its resistance to easy summary or categorization. I guess I‚Äôm back where I started, trying to decide what this movie is about. As with any original and challenging work, the answer may take a while to emerge, but what strikes me now is less the pain of Chiron‚Äôs circumstances than the sense that, in spite of everything, he is free. A bullied, neglected and all-but-silent child, he grows toward an understanding of himself and his world, and though it is agonizing to witness his progress, it is also thrilling. To be afforded a window into another consciousness is a gift that only art can give. To know Chiron is a privilege.

Nothing against black or gay people, but it's a movie that was born in 2016 that had a not so good story and that ended not so well. I wished La La Land won the oscar. Even if it didn't and some other movie won I wouldn't have minded. But this film really rubbed in the whole, ""HE'S BLACK AND GAY!! YOU HAVE TO FEEL BAD FOR HIM"" thing for me. And at the oscars the director briefly acknowledged La La Land but it was so brief and he didn't even look at them. People shouldn't focus on giving a film an oscar just because it had to with different races or because someone is gay or trans, people should give it an oscar because it had a great story with a lot of work and skill put into it. Not saying this film didn't have that, it did. But I know and everyone else knows this film won because it had to do with a black gay person.

But I have more faith in Rotten Tomatoes reviews of what are the best movies of the year rather than the Oscars.  Every year the Oscars just feels like it's getting more and more politically correct in it's winners.  So winners are chosen not on the movie but on if some subject matter or group of people are in it and the SJW are behind it.  So even before movie was out it was going to be an Oscar winner by having a story of a gay black man battling poverty and gang violence.  In my option the best movie of the year is the most entertaining not the one that the one that only film and art students go see.,2017-02-27T14:14:55.000Z,0

This was the first time in my entire life that a moment in a film brought me to tears, and I am a straight pacific islander who grew up in conditions not at all comparable to the ones in this film.

2016-08-11T15:00:01.000Z,9NJj12tJzqc,Moonlight | Official Trailer HD | A24,"What happens when everyone is Chiron:

When Chiron was Little, he wanted to be himself, but only got hurt when he tried, so badly hurt he would forever carry the pain of these wounds. Chiron would cry so much that sometime he felt he might turn into a drop of water and roll out with the multitude of drops into the black depths of the ocean. One night when he went to the beach to cry some more, looking blue in the moonlight, he was touched by the only man who would ever touch him, and change the trajectory of his life. When that man hurt him even more, Chiron stopped crying. He became like all the other Rambo-fuckers and drowned his sorrow. Instead of being himself he became black and never tried to be anything else. Black reconnected with the only man who would ever touch him, who was also black, and together they caressed in the moonlight.

Moonlight: the light of the moon - have a second job in addition to one's regular employment

Black: of the very darkest color owing to the absence of or complete absorption of light - of any human group having dark coloured skin, especially of African or Australian Aboriginal ancestry

Chiron: is symbolized by the ‚Äúwounded healer‚Äù. It represents our deepest wound, and our efforts to heal the wound. Chiron was named after the centaur in Greek mythology who was a healer and teacher who, ironically, could not heal himself.",2017-02-26T07:17:12.000Z,0

I went to see it with a friend and the more we talked about the film and the imagery, the more that we appreciated every turn the movie took. I do have some qualms with the film, but it's not even really a qualm because all I wanted was more of the movie. I legit would watch another hour of this film because ugh, the color scheme, the ACTING, it's all superb.

I really related to Ashton Sanders' story and the acting in Act ll. The scene in the principals office had me choking up. [SPOILER] If Black had broken down in that moment, I would've been sobbing in the movie theater. I was hella choked up and bye yes were brimming with tears. Ashton played an emotional constipated and fragile teen so well. There was so much emotion in his eyes and ugh, I could go on and on <3",2017-02-25T12:24:16.000Z,1

Naomie Harris and Mahershala Ali play pretty well but I don't think that he is going to get an oscar for 15 minutes play.On the other hand Naomie vs Viola Davis (Fences) is an interesting battle for the oscar.I watched also La La Land,Hacksaw Ridge,Hell or Highwater and Hidden figures.I think Moolight is going to take probably the movie of the year due to so deep messages.I enjoyed La La Land much more to be honest though.Great film ! 8/10",2017-02-24T09:32:55.000Z,0

I thought that was an excellent job on this trailer. Aside from that I feel like the movie keeps you engaged by giving you many vague scenes. There are unclear and very random moments in the film and don't really connect to a significant meaning and don't really build up to a climax. There's no climax in this film. It feels like a documentary which I love. But this won't be for everyone. It's tough to watch this film more than once because you don't feel like you missed anything . One ,because it's not much talking at all going on. So it's an engaging movie until you seen at least once. Just my opinion , I hope I didn't give the film away still a must watch.

It's some what of a mellow drama. Not my kind of movie but I can tell a good picture when I see it. I just think not everyone is going to like it and that's ok because everyone is entitled to their opinion. But for an independent film this made a splash. So props to the director. Although it's not the kind of movie you can watch twice in my opinion It's just wayyyyyy too many awkward silences in this movie. It has about a full hour worth of awkward silence time. Not much talking going on in this thing at all and I hate how they skipped through his life without showing any other encounters he may have had with the opposite sex or the same sex for that matter but There were no girls in this movie through showing him find himself.,2017-02-24T05:32:17.000Z,0

But when asked ""Is your name Blue?"", Juan replies ""No"", rejecting that. So I sort of feel like the ""moonlight"" refers to some kind of lens people see through and see other people as merely their race and nothing else. Anyone agree/has other ideas?

Saw the trailer before the movie and thought it was an inner city drama revolving around a young black child growing up and surviving.

Way to go with the gay agenda Holly-weird! Now I see why it was nominated. I would have been more impressed with the nomination had it been a straight (pun intended) forward movie without the gay storyline.

Why do Black movies only receive nominations when Black actors play crooked cops, abusive mothers, maids, slaves, drug dealers, crack addicts, lesbians and homosexuals? I can go on and on but you get the point.",2017-02-18T09:21:37.000Z,1

2016-08-11T15:00:01.000Z,9NJj12tJzqc,Moonlight | Official Trailer HD | A24,"I thought the movie started out good but then I found myself being rather disinterested and my interest went downhill from there.  I hated the ending because the movie took you past coming of age but left you in what appeared to be adulthood going no where.  Let me say, I saw it without knowing anything of what it was about.  To me, it was not a Gay movie until the end and I am not even sure it was then.  What I saw was a young boy being bullied because he was small, dressed differently, and had more of a responsible attitude.  I saw a mother keep telling the boy how much she loved him but she wasn't willing to make the change needed to show him love.  I saw a boy discovering and experiencing sex.  I saw a boy sharing love (not sex) from another boy that was set in the same environment.  I saw one boy give in to the crime life that would most likely send him back to prison whereas the other boy realized his mistakes and focused on making a new life for himself.  The acting was good.  Maybe there was no where else for the movie to go from there.",2017-01-26T18:27:10.000Z,0

1. Acting is really average and competent without any stand-out performance at all. This is unlike ""Captain Fantastic"" and ""Fences"" when the whole cast did well.
2. This is obviously a shameful Oscar bait. African American poverty, drugs, homosexuality, coming-of-age, broken family. What more do you need to complete the stereotype?
3. Does it add anything new to the discussion on these issues? Nope.
4. Poor pacing. It used to be innovative for draggy and slow pacing to add the necessary shine to art-house films. But that was in the late 1990s. Get over it.
5. You sort of expect something to happen throughout the movie. But nothing ever did. The last scene is really pretentious and could really be edited significantly.",2017-01-24T10:16:42.000Z,0

Why do these black people sound like slaves using words like ""I's"" and ""We's""? are you for real. Its as if the director said lets just have them sound like slaves since we don't have NO IDEA¬†how black people from Fla talk. Next there is so much air in the dialogue. So much so, that the actors at times seem awkward in the silent gaps. The story telling was awful as well. They poke at an attempt to create an origin story but its left with just as many holes as the previously mentioned gaps in¬†dialogue.¬†Finally, we get to the, of course, gay propaganda. The emasculation of black men at its ripest. this is what makes me most mad about this film;¬†even with all of the above mentioned issues,¬†it still receives a slew of critical acclaim. Makes one see that all this movie is leaning on is black emasculation, slave speaking blacks, and gay propaganda.",2017-01-21T22:34:21.000Z,0

It is perfection filmmaking by Barry Jenkins. The performances across the board where outstanding. Everyone's performance felt real and genuine. Mahershala Ali and Naomi Harris really steal the show in the supporting cast along with Janelle Mon√°e. And as for the six actors who played Chiron and Kevin, kid, teen, or adult, they all were perfect. The film also had an amazing script, jaw dropping cinematography, and a haunting score. The characters were rich and complex and felt like they were real people. The film is filled with realism and often is very hard to watch but at the same time it is so captivating and you can't take your eyes off the screen. Even the little details were perfect. The lighting, sound mixing, editing,¬† visual metaphors, and character details were so thought out and meaningful. The films plot is simple but effective. We've seen films where we watch the main character grow up in front of our eyes such as Boyhood but it's done with such class here that is gives off a completely fresh and new feel. The way the film is broken up into three chapters also gave it an interesting spin. The chapters are broken up nearly ten years apart so us the audience has to piece some things together in order to understand the development of the characters. The atmosphere also gives it this unique feeling. It's beautiful but very haunting and it really stays with you. Miami (where the film takes place) feels like a character. Not to mention the movie has not only a fantastic score but some of the best uses of music in any movie particularly during the third chapter which also has one of the best scenes in any film of the past decade. There are so many little nuances and things to talk about for hours after the viewing. On its surface it may not be relatable to many people but when you break it down it has something that anyone could grab onto. Whether you've had a tough time growing up, living in poverty, being homosexual, being bullied, not having a father figure, having a parent who is addicted to drugs, self discovery, becoming someone you're not, being different, covering yourself up, standing up for yourself, accepting forgiveness, or being a human being. This is a human story.¬† It's absolutely mesmerizing. Beautiful, brilliant, poetic, sad but uplifting. It is perfect in length and never gets boring. It doesn't drag and ends leaving you asking questions and wanting more. Needing to experience it again. It's subject matter is important but it never tries to beat you over the head with it. It leaves you speechless. It does something that true art should do and that is leave you having discussions. MOONLIGHT is a MASTERPIECE.

Okay, one had spaceships and aliens in them but it was not filled with big battle scenes and focused mostly on learning how to speak the aliens language. Yet both films had the audiences full attention. On the surface, they seem almost nothing alike, and yet they are so similar. They both encourage empathy in a time when it does not seem to be encouraged, and like ""Arrival"" ""Moonlight"" was more interested in tension and possibility than explosive moments. After the election, many people were confused, angry and afraid and hopefully when they left they felt a little less so. I know I did.

I saw films like  Boyhood and Birman and saw how the trailers look interesting but when I saw  the films I just felt they were just average at best. Is this film not like slow and is good for an average moviegoer I guess.,2016-12-29T05:49:30.000Z,1

I really thought it would be good too. The movie is just too slow and instead of filling up the movie with a good story they spent a lot of time just trying to capture cool looking scene or just wasting time with long unnecessary scenes and stares. the movie just didn't have enough of a story. I felt like I barely knew who the characters were by the end. This¬†directors had a GREAT idea in trying to show how¬†a boy grows up in the black community and how most biys grow up in general, especially the loner types with a bad home life. But there needed to be more of a damn story! This movie had the chance to be the next Forest Gump, the characters were interesting and charismatic, the whole idea of the movie was showing how life is but IMO they ended up not telling any story worth watching. And the part that made no sense to me was that there was one scene where Chiron¬†gets older and he checks out¬†Teresas¬† breasts and¬†she¬†awkwardly notices. So that insinuates that hes just becoming attracted to girls, but then at the end of the movie¬†Chiron insinuates that he never had a care for girls because¬†Kevin was the only one that felt right for him. So is he straight, Gay, Bi but couldn't let go of his first ""love"" if you can even call hi that? The movie didn't do a good job in explaining his sexuality in fact all it did was make it seem as if Homosexuality is just a lust thing since all Chiron had to get was a handjob from Kevin to make him fall in love or something. Is it me or was this movie have major plot holes and just lacked more of a story?",2016-11-16T20:39:23.000Z,9

Before, I thought this was going to be a sprayed down version of social justice, instead it was an amazing film. This is an art film, but I swear every shot taken,  could be those fancy screen savers in the mall. The story was really good, and I like how this character isn't played up as the stereotypical black gay person, instead you can feel the emotion in his performances. I also like how they went over the conflict of not only one vs society, but they cued in an important conflict no one likes to discuss LGBT vs. African American. Overall I felt I was watching a masterpiece and not propaganda. I would say more but that would spoil the movie. 10/10.",2016-11-09T03:39:29.000Z,94

I don't know anybody in my family that is gay and I have a big family I'm not saying that I don't have a gay family member I just don't know about it but going to school no lie I was a class clown so I joked on everybody including my teachers, but I never clowned on people 2 hard because you never what is going on in somebodys house hold. I dealt with my pops being an alcoholic and beating on my moms plus he never grew up with a pops so had to learn on the way on how to be a dad even tho he is fucked up he took care of us and was married to my mom for 26 years. anyway this had made look at the lbgt community from a different light in the black community it seems like we don't report sexually child abuse and tend to be ruthless to gay people but just thinking about it it's a reason why most of those dudes end coming out as gay in jail because while they was growing up in the streets they had to live a different life that wouldn't except that but if you gay be gay by nigga because at the end of the day it doesn't effect my personal life but if you're gay and you still fuck with women please be straight up with them because you gotta be real with our women when it comes down to this kind of stuff",2016-11-07T15:24:25.000Z,0

This is a film trying to shed light on sexuality by bashing down the stereotypical barriers and at the same time trying to correctly convey a certain location and how those inhabitants are affected by it and those around them. I seen someone say something about all black people's morals being affected by Christian faith and I think that basically says that other races' outlook on homosexuality isn't and I think that's racist within itself, even if that's not the intention of the statement. In fact, most reasons why homophobia is rampant still to this day by all races is because it stems from religious beliefs. You think white people aren't raised to live by outdated ideas about masculinity? You don't any kid, regardless of race is safe from being subjected from bullying via homophobic actions? While I cannot speak for the black race myself for obvious reasons, I've had a few different black friends (a term I hate to use but makes sense for this argument) that say that they know more ""down low"" black men with gfs/wives/kids than they do of other races. That may be an outrageous statement to some, but in my area there is truth in it, even if it's not completely accurate. I know several gay or trans black men from either work or mutual friends, and IF the black community is harder on their homosexual men than other races, I truly feel sorry for those people. I work with a pair of black twins, one of which is gay. The heterosexual brother and other members of their family beat him down physically simply bc he came out. Maybe this film without relying on flamboyant stereotypical gay men, can really say something about those black men and that's quite alright. But to say others aren't pressured into keeping their secret to themselves without fear of persecution by loved ones is the silliest thing I've seen all day.

In where i live (GA) guys of all races though especially black ones (i notice it a lo more with black guys because the population) are always ridiculed or shunned of being gay. It's not a choice and people don't just wake up one day and say ""I wanna like guys or girls or both"". I hate it when people always wanna use the word faggot because liking the same gender for guys has always been seen as weak or more feminine. So I'm really happy that they brought to attention with this movie. Hopefully a lot of people watch it. even people who hate gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. And to anyone making jokes and calling these people names for literally no reason that I can see, If you hate them that much then why are you in this comment section or looking at this trailer in the first place? Just think if the rules were switched and being straight was thought as bad or weak or stupid? You don't usually choose your sexual orientation. Your born that way. Though society and people may try to influence you to like other types of people, that's just who you are and no matter who you are you shouldn't have to change yourself to please other people. The human population is 7 billion! They can't all be they same. That's just human nature so you have to accept it.",2016-10-30T00:14:44.000Z,0

THE OVERHAULING OF STRAIGHT AMERICA
By Marshall Kirk and Erastes Pill

*A large-scale media campaign will be required in order to change the image of gays in America. And any campaign to accomplish this turnaround should do six things.

*Where we talk is important. The visual media, film and television, are plainly the most powerful image-makers in Western civilization. The average American household watches over seven hours of TV daily. Those hours open up a gateway into the private world of straights, through which a Trojan horse might be passed. 

*In no time, a skillful and clever media campaign could have the gay community looking like the veritable fairy godmother to Western Civilization.

*At a later stage of the media campaign for gay rights-long after other gay ads have become commonplace-it will be time to get tough with remaining opponents. To be blunt, they must be vilified. 

*Without access to TV, radio, and the mainstream press, there will be no campaign. This is a tricky problem, became many impresarios of the media simply refuse to accept what they call ""issue-advertising"" -- persuasive advertising can provoke 
a storm of resentment from the public and from sponsors, which is bad for business. 



There's more of it in that document too.  Quite a bit more.  You ppl who ""accept"" this stuff have no idea how you are being hustled and what comes along w/ this nonsense smh.....",2016-09-03T20:24:24.000Z,5

The initial viewing of this trailer took my fucking breath away. I don't think I've seen anything like this--handled with such care--before in mainstream film. Finally what appears to be a central filmic narrative focusing on the harrowing sexual development of a beautiful dark skin black boy's journey into manhood. There are scenes that look brutal tough, because...well the subject matter is tough. Yet I'm hoping what we'll also see for this character in his journey, is the love and hard-won affirmation that is so desperately needed as powerful and redemptive representation for QPOC and black folks as a whole!
