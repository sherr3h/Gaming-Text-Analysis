Dwayne won't ever touch Arnold if he doesn't dare to allow himself to be taken for more serious roles. It's like an avengers style movie, which will sell enough tickets. But Dwayne should dare to attempt the Maximus in Gladiator , or the William Wallace in brave heart. Oscar award? No, but that's why Arnold brought Conan to a cult status in movies because the film had the heart of a great epic , even while the leading man wasn't a superb actor , we really believe he is a barbarian, oddly enough. 
  Dwayne just seems like ""it's the rock , wearing cave man outfit or something , is this a Marvel movie?"" 
They are not going to let him have any good dialogue, the real leading actor is the cgi and special effects. And that's an opportunity lost to make a good movie. 
 These days the trailer is better than this type of movies. Like Man of steel. That trailer actually tried to look like it was going to be epic. Epic performances, epic story, but no. It kinda sucked. ",2015-05-11T04:18:15.000Z,0
