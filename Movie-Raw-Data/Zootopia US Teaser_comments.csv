I remember seeing this trailer when I went to see Inside Out, I was liking this trailer for the first 30 seconds.  I was like ""Hey this looks pretty cute, I like how they don't have clothes like in Lion King.""  But at 0:30 that's what ruined it for me because personally I don't like the design of animals with clothes on.  It felt unnecessary to give them clothes here because it's not like they were showing privates to begin with so why do they have to wear clothes?  I know this is silly but I just don't like the character designs in this movie.",2018-12-07T20:15:48.000Z,1

They're relationship would not go well in the beginning (They would probably get arrested...Or blackmailed) slowly they would grow a bond somehow towards the end of it...there would be a betrayal (Either he would piss her off...Or she would piss him off) Both would be depressed afterwards one would apologize (Either the male or the female...but usually the female because the male is too stubborn or blinded by his beliefs...His betrayal or her betrayal) After they made up they would team up against the enemy and defeat (Him or her) in a battle of wit 

I predicted this from the start xD this is my prediction from before the movie...Sound familiar?",2016-05-19T03:52:07.000Z,2

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"""Like nothing you've even seen be-fur""
While I agree that that was an excellent pun, one that Sans would approve of, and I have yet to see the movie, but wouldn't it be at least a LITTLE bit similar to Disney's Robin Hood, Disney's The Jungle Book, Disney's The Lion King, maybe even a little bit like Dreamworks' Madagascar?

Also, I'm pretty sure its statistically impossible for something to be like ""Nothing you've ever seen be-fur"" because every idea ever comes from our brains taking stuff we've seen and jumbling them up into something new, making it statistically impossible for anything made or done by man to be absolutely NOTHING like anything else...
And statistically unlikely for something to be nothing like someone has seen before. But still, that phrase, as good a pun as it is, is still incorrect because it is saying that to millions of people, meaning it can't ALWAYS be correct...

Dang it i keep sort of disproving myself...

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"1. Saw the movie. You should see it too.2. Why does everyone say this is a furry movie? I don't get it. They say that the animals walk on two legs, wear clothes, use technology, act like humans do, and that apparently makes them furries. Y'know what other characters match that exact description? Mickey Mouse, Goofy, and Donald, to name a few. Yet I don't see people freaking out over why they are furries, and need to burn and stuff. Now, this part is for the furries. Honestly, I don't get why you do what you do, but hey, if it helps you out in some way, allows you to meet other people with confidence, knock yourself out. I mainly have a problem with the obsessive furries known as ""furfags."" First time I saw this teaser was last year when I saw Inside Out in theaters. The minute the word anthropomorphic came on the screen, I knew the crazy furries would be all over, and that the Zootopia tags on Instagram, Tumblr, etc. would be overflowing with posts mentioning, ""yay a furry movie im so happy"" and I was right. By now, I realize that posting this may or may not start a flame war, but I'm too deep in now. Basically, stop associating this movie with furries or calling this movie a furry movie. It's simply a nice Disney movie for families, with animals that walk and talk, which Disney has been doing before any of you were born. I now await the strongly written replies below. Just try to be respectful to one another, okay? Like I said, it's a family movie, so kids might be on here.",2016-02-23T09:17:16.000Z,0

if anthropomorphic means animals that wears cloths, walk on two feet, and use modern technology does that mean that humans are anthropomorphic as well.

Humans are animals that walk on two legs, wear cloth, etc...

then if that's the case then there just animals with human behavior.

then if it means that anthropomorphic means any animal that behaves like a different animal that have no relation to it own species.

then we could say that people who are furries or zoophilias are anthropomorphic because they are not behaving like humans. 

so in other words, the terms anthropomorphic, does not truly exist because it is based on a opinion a denotative meaning.",2015-11-25T23:35:15.000Z,0

Now, i'm not saying that 3D animation is bad or anything but the market is saturated by it and it would be really refreshing to see hand-drawn again... Especially from a giant like Disney that has such a rich history with hand-drawn... I get that some movies will probably look better 3D animated (like Tangled with Rapunzel's hair) but i don't think it is crucial for Zootopia (ok, maybe a little with the fur and all) or especially Moana. I'm worried that Disney has abandoned hand-drawn after the Princess and the Frog flop box-office-wise. In my opinion it looks absolutely stunning and the story and music are amazing!
But what can i do? Market and money will always dictate the course of a company, which is why we should support Disney and go to theatres and buy dvds especially when a hand-drawn movie comes out.

I'm not attracted to animals, but I'm a furry none the less. Disney probably didn't even have the word ""furry"" in their minds while making this movie. so fuck off if you don't like furries, or at least avoid us. stop calling us furry fags. you know why? your probably a fat fucking troll sitting on your ass making these stupid comments!! so fuck off trolls. this movie is probably made for kids. not assholes....",2015-11-04T20:01:07.000Z,0

I pray to Fox every night, thanking him for the techskill I've been given. ""Fox is love"" I say, ""Fox is life"". My dad overhears me and calls me a meleefag. 
I knew he was just jealous of my high tier main. I call him a casual. He slaps me and sends me to sleep. I'm crying now, and my face hurts. I lay in bed and it's really cold.
A warmth is moving towards me.  I feel something touch me... It's Fox. I am so happy.

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"Hm not sure if okay or piss about this. Reason for piss is I am not 100% sure but they might have taken some minor ideas from a webcomic called zoophobia by a artist called vivziepop and thats been here bit longer before they announce this with concept art while back. 
So for ppl reading and wondering what is zoophobia this how it goes. Zoophobia is a hidden city filled with animals and then the 2 similarities are the animals and city are there. What's different is in zoophobia the animals that talk have the ability to shift into human form or cross between that (example deer looks like a boy but with deer ears and some small antlers) or a anthro form of it like shown with characters here. Some humans also exist in this city if chosen to become a resident. Also coexist in the city are demonic and monster like characters but most of them are good and if you read the webcomic it explains how they live together. 
Now here is they are all anthro form, no humans, demons and monsters and its target is for kids while zoophobia is a bit 16+ age range (some violence and language in it). So again I am not sure if they took some minor ideas from it but just saying when this gets popular and ppl find out about zoophobia and be idiots saying the artist took ideas from this she didn't. The webcomic was here longer before they release concept art of this movie. 
The webcomic and character designs are really good and worth checking out. She even has some videos here and plans to do her own short animated series called hazbin hotel. ",2015-09-22T08:13:35.000Z,0

German Translation:
In der Welt von Zootopia, gibt es keine Menschen.
Zootopia ist, eine moderne, zivilisierte, Welt...
...welche total tiereisch ist!
Das, ist ein Tier.

Tiere in Zootopia, sind anthroposophisch...
...was nur eine aufgeblasene Formulierung daf√ºr ist,
das sie auf zwei Beinen gehen,
sie nicht nackt zur Arbeit gehen.
Danke
Beinahe
Das is besser
Und sie nutzten Technologie

Ok, hier sind S√§ugetiere, des ganzen Planeten, in Zootopia
Gro√üe und Kleine, schnell und tr√§ge
Aber die Wahrheit ist, Zootopia is' nicht perfekt.
Und wie in unsrer' Welt, gibt es Reiberein...
...speziell nat√ºrliche Feinde!
Was, zu Problemen, f√ºhrn' kann...
...aber Tiere haben nat√ºrliche √úberlebensf√§higkeiten...w√§hrend einer super Finstersicht hat...h√∂rt der andere besonders gut!

From what I gather, it's just people that pretend to be animals, right? And that annoys people? Haven't we had an odd, and rather large collection of superheroes that pretend to animals? (pushing back to the fifties and further) Including villains, (So many via batman universes ._.) We've also made an insane amount of games/movies/tv shows that use anthropomorphic animals. I will pick some random ones like Alien Soldier, Swat Katz, Street Sharks (love it) compared to the obviously well known ones such as Sonic and TMNT and Looney Tunes. If anything, at the rate these have been pushed out over the years, shouldn't there be a lot more furries than there are since they are almost always in a positive light? What makes it bad? Just the fact it makes people insanely uncomfortable, or what?

Seriously, not to offend Furries anywhere, but I kind of find furry-dom or whatever it's called kind of weird, and at times it can be disgusting, especially when it comes to extreme furries who make weird porn an whatnot. But here's the question;

What does this movie have to do with furries?

I mean seriously, they're sentient animals who walk around without humans and wear clothes? Not sure where furry comes into the equation at all, unless we want to call movies like Chicken Little, Disney's Robin Hood, Madagascar, and everything to do with Mickey Mouse furry content as well. Does someone want to enlighten me on this? I personally find this to be quite an intriguing movie thus far.",2015-07-13T06:04:30.000Z,2

They also party hard, too. In very much the same way that all fandoms gain their outside image from the worst of the worst (ie. bronies and fat fedora-wearing Hot Topic shoppers), furries gain their recognition from the copious amounts of porn that come from the 0.01% of the community. Sure, there's a few weird grapes in the bunch, but they should definitely not be the main image given to the hundreds of thousands of varying representatives. Of course you're going to hear the worst parts about any fandom; scandalous news sells the most. What you may find, however, is just a bunch of friendly people gathering and sharing the same interests. In fact, go ahead and shed light on the subject yourself; toss out what you know about furries and try out the community.

First: This movie is the perfect opportunity for us to talk like civilized people about our differences, so don't screw this up by defending your postures blindly, be smart and listen.
Second: This movie is NOT aimed for furries only, Disney knows that following the furry identity they can get free advertising and hype, because we will talk about this for months, i'm sure. The reason Disney is using anthropomorphic animals as protagonists and giving it so much importance is for the secondary plot, the part about discrimination between species and because kids love animals.
Third: Yes, this furry hype will end in a lot of people interested in the furry fandom. You can do nothing about that, you can't sink furries image, you will only expose yourself as a discriminative ignorant by trying it.
In conclusion: ignore the fact that furries will love this movie, just stop talking about that. And for the furries, stop saying ""i love this movie because i'm furry"" nobody cares if you are a furry, that's not making you a more interesting person, so shut up about that.
If we can talk about how well made are the characters and if we can say or opinions about the plot, i will be really happy, because i think i'll enjoy this movie.",2015-07-12T21:59:48.000Z,0

They better have a HUGE unique story packed with it. Otherwise it's just a big copy of everything they have done so far. 

But because we know they won't have one big new story idea, this is what will happen:

1. One animal species will fight against another species at the end everyone is getting along

2. They destroy the earth with technology. The happy ending is realizing that they need to care more about it

3. Some badass villains maybe some kind of humans, or aliens, or even their own species will have an evil plan. They all will fight against him. No matter how small or big you are. Because if we hold together we can do everything.

'Cause I don't see no plot or anything resembling one based on this trailer. As it stands, there's noting that indicates why children and manchildren should see this film; it's just the world itself, with no real plot or characters indicated. Without these things, you don't have a movie worth seeing.

In short: this trailer should've been thrown into the dustbin. Because there's nothing of value in it, and it don't serve as a good advertisement since it don't explain nothin' but the world which in itself is not original. Please explain why you do this Disney.",2015-07-09T06:05:08.000Z,0

WHO THE FUCK CARES IF THIS IS MADE FOR FURRIES.

Like seriously? Even if it was? Does that make the film 'porn' on it's self? Even if it's made for 'those furries'? Who fucking cares? It's not hurting anyone. Seriously, we have real people violating wills of people; we have rape, and other violence. Why the fuck do we have to have a problem with something so fucking harmless?

I doubt it's made only to furries but it could include it.. And I'll say, why not? I find it awesome to make more communities happy, and to embrace the 'culture' of it.

The only thing I don't like about this trailer is the limited trendy so-called definition of 'anthropomorphic' as 'anthropomorphic' CAN include four legged creatures with human characteristics.

But back on this main thing.. Seriously this whole fucking majority media against 'differences' is one of the strong reasons as to why I am a misanthropic.",2015-07-08T10:57:43.000Z,1

Disney is going back to their roots with this film. I like that. Good on them, at least acknowledging where their fame and fortune came from, ya know? Same can be said for Warner Bros. Animation. Loony Tunes ring a bell, anyone?

Good to know. (Mostly it was the hyenas who spent the entire movie talking about eating and how lions being in charge meant not enough food, Scar nearly eating Zazu, Timon worried Simba would want to eat him and Pumbaa and clipping his nails to prevent it, Zazu having to sing for Scar to STILL avoid being eaten, and then Scar getting eaten by the hyena henchanimals at the end.) Please let none of this be the case in this movie. I mean, I know, carnivores need to eat meat, but as long as it's not where they actually hunt others in this civilized society...I mean, that defeats the purpose of calling it ""civilized.""",2015-06-28T15:13:39.000Z,0

What do you people have against furries?! Why are you all so obviously planning the Furry/Furry Artist Holocaust?!?! Why are you people so Goddam mother FUCKING relentless?!?!?!
Look, I may only be a furry ARTIST (who's only drawn two sexual things, mind you), but really! You are all against furries and furry artists! I knew a friend back in middle school who was drawing out plans for a fursuit, so why not kill her?! Why not kill me?!?! Why not kill everyone who even likes something that has furries in it?!?!?!?!?! Look, if you all hate furries so much, then go back to your PewDiePie porn and shut up!

Oh, and don't call me a 12-year-old. It's been quite some time since I was 12. If you still don't believe me that I'm not twelve, watch my latest videos. I doubt a 12-year-old has a voice THAT deep.

What I don't get is... why is it suddenly relevant that the characters are animals?

That being said, this trailer is overly glorifying a very generic concept for nowadays, and doesn't helps me understand what I'm supposed to be expecting from this movie, other than the fact that everyone is an animal.",2015-06-27T18:02:53.000Z,0

I mean what movies (not just owned by Disney) have ever had anthropomorphic animals in them. Yeah, none!

Well... apart from:¬†
-Animaniacs
-Looney Tunes
-Who Framed Roger Rabbit
-Fantastic Mr. Fox
-Over The Hedge
-Robin Hood
-An American Tale
-The Goofy Movie
-Cats don't Dance
-The Great Mouse Detective
-Rock-a-Doodle
-Kung Fu Panda
-Rango
-Winnie the Pooh
-Alice in Wonderland
-Jungle Book
-Madagascar
-Chicken Run
-The Nine Lives of Fritz the cat
-The Secret of Nimh
-Space Jam
-Flushed Away

Oh... and these TV Shows:
-Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog¬†
-Alvin and the Chipmunks
-Darkwing Duck¬†
-Thunder Cats
-Duck Tales 
-Arthur 
-Danger Mouse¬†
-Spongebob Squarepants
-Underdog
-Count Duckula
-Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
-Chip and Dale (Rescue Rangers)

But... they weren't furry movies. They just contained walking, talking animals in them...¬†

Why would Disney want walking and talking animals in a movie anyway? I mean, what would Mickey Mouse (their official mascot) have to say about this if he was real? He'd be appalled.",2015-06-24T14:48:51.000Z,2

This will make the fandom better, not the Zootopia worse: furries need a legitimate outlet so their image would be less sexual . A huge bit of the fandom is completely harmless and non-pornographic but of course that has no news value.
I guess if people learned about anime from 4chan and other weeaboos instead of kids shows like DBZ you'd have the same idea about anime as you have now about the furry fandom. Same goes for comics and cartoons too. My point is, that it's not nearly as bad as you were led to believe.

I like animal-centered Disney films that portray the animals very realistically (Bambi, The Fox and the Hound, The Lion King, Tarzan, etc.), and even though this isn't technically new for Disney to portray the animals like humans, hopefully this will be Chicken Little done the right way and sorta an apology for that film ten years¬†ago.",2015-06-20T16:19:08.000Z,0

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"First thoughts: Yay, a new Disney movie about Anthropomorphic animals! I love seeing Anthropomorphic animals and it will be nice to get a new Antho animal movie that is not the horrible wreck that Chicken Little was. I will look at the comments and see how happy everyone else is.

The comments are filled with tons of unreasonable hate and that really makes me angry. Why are there so many people attacking Furries? They are just people that like seeing the type of animals shown in this teaser. Many people complained ""stupid Furys tink dis movie is 4 dem even tho disney makes dis stuf alot"" I have seen tons of those complaints and no Furries actually saying this movie was made specifically for them. Think logically, why would Disney target such a small audience? The answer is they wouldn't, and most Furries know that.¬†

As for the way this teaser was made, I see no actual mention of Furries so would people just stop bringing them up. 90% of the comments is about Furries even though they were not mentioned at all. Disney would never bring up Furries because that could bring a lot of controversy, and even though that would get them a lot of attention, a lot of it would be bigoted losers that wouldn't watch the movie.",2015-06-19T19:03:42.000Z,2

Some of you forget to realize that Disney is responsible for a lot of people to be a furry from Robin Hood to majority of the Disney Afternoon cartoons in the late 1980s through the mid 1990s (Which where I fall under) to everything else. You want to stop the fandom? Build a time machine, go back to before Robin Hood was made before Walt's death and convince him to make sure no movie or cartoon dealing with anthropomorphic animals are never made. Oh? Too lazy to build one? Forgetting Looney Tunes among others also helped make people furries too? Or you just want to continue on that furries will ruin everything which newsflash, those idiotic moronic trolls on 4Chan and others ruin things to get ""lols"" but never take responsibility for their actions so blaming others for their failures is the only way they feel better!

So the TL;DR version is this: Furries are here to stay, movies like Zootopia will make more furries and all your whining isn't going to stop it. So please, STFU and deal with it!",2015-06-16T13:13:58.000Z,1

It really sticks in my claw Disney introduced this with the line that humans never existed, it just acknowledges us the audience, I did not think it added any more excitement to see this upcoming movie. Also, it somehow fascinates me how anthropomorphic animals are not accepted as part of the mainstream of any country, not only America. Earliest record of animals with human characteristics were in Ancient Egypt, look no further than the eagle-headed sun god Ra.

Shut the fuck up.
This movie isn't about you furries, nor will it feature any. If anything they will poke fun at them. You aren't getting your own movie, and if you ever did, it would be directed by C-list directors and get a 2% on Metacritic. You furries think you're the most dominant fandom when you really aren't. Just because a film features anthropomorphic animals doesn't mean they're furries. Stop commenting about this being furry related and go back to putting your horrible MS Paint scribbles onto Deviantart.",2015-06-16T03:25:38.000Z,51

(Well, I guess. Because mammals are very accomplished--when it comes to heightened skills and evolution. Ha! Beat that, dinosaurs!) shouldn't it instead, be called: Mammaltopia?
   If you see anything but mammals, type it in this corner. Thank you!

       Anyways. I hope that the new Disney movies would lay off the ""CG craze"".(CG=computer graphics.) Because, so many movies are into that tiring trend; including our beloved Disney.This person, wants some eye-licious, hand-drawn animation. Right now! Right then! Everything must be balanced. CG may be very realistic looking and all, with the skin and hair and etc. But, kids want more of the old, unrealistic stuff that they saw their parents watched. Classics, like Cinderella, Lion King, and more. Those were the dreams of the past. Even so, CG is not the only thing butting into movies. Oh no. I spied Disney, countless of times; remixing some of their dusty classics in the back of their theme park closet; they have created live actioned movies out of these old tapes/DVDs. Example ( claps hands): oh look! A wild movie, named Cinderella has appeared in theaters! No! Wait! This is not the old one! It's a live actioned one. (Have pity on our future generation, please!)
  ----Sorry, though (after taking a deep breath from my crazed dislike rage). Hffff....pffff. So,so,sorry. I've never watched their new live actioned Cinderella movie, at all, never before. I have jumped a great far distance into the jagged conclusions and I've judged a movie that I had never seen before; which is why I criticize a lot, especially when I stood still, watching the trailer with unblinking eyes and desperately, ranting under my breath out loud about my straining thoughts Disney's attempt at trying something new with their oldies. 
     Many people have serious and silly opinions. Some, may clapped for the film, because of its unique difference to its original counterpart. While others chose to stick their thumbs down and bawl at the monstrosity of the movie, created by lazy film-makers, recycling old movies to obtain some hard cash from this generation's young.
     Well,then. I must be off. Back into the dark side-lines. So I could judge some more in the darkness. Evaluating everything, in my own way. See ya, viewers!!!",2015-06-16T02:59:02.000Z,0

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"There's a lot of comments about furries. Having an internet connection and reading though lots of comments and stuff, naturally I am aware of such things. I actually have theory about furries and bronies. I think that everyone has a piece inside of them that is satisfied from social interaction. I think these are people who have for some reason lost the ability for that piece inside of them to be satisfied by other people. But furry and brony characters are characters who are like people, but they are also created to be very accessible to people with underdeveloped socialization, by design. So these characters appeal to these guys. I mean, MLP has a fanbase of people who probably large numbers of them would have trouble being completely comfortable in a normal adult relationship. Just going off the stereotype.. I could be wrong, (but am I) I've seen reviews of mlp, even tried to watch an episode (it was like the time I tried to listen to a Justin Bieber song, I couldn't make it all the way through). But in the case of MLP the characters are essentially candy colored little women (in like .. horse form .. I know .. but still) in a friendly accessible fantasy world, so is it any wonder these characters appeal to them? And since they are probably also repressed when it comes to natural sexuality, is it any wonder there is a rather prominent amount of porn dedicated to the subject as well? To me it seems like it's almost logical that it exists. And I don't really care, there's worse things to be into, it's not something I think it's healthy to be all about, it's not something that I think someone should TRY to be into, but frankly it's like eating a bad diet or playing too much video games, it's harmful to the person, but I don't think it's that harmful to others. The ironic thing is that hostile social environments I think is what ends up shaping people who go into these fanbases in the first place, so people who are angry about weird but probably harmless people are actually the ones who ironically play one of the largest roles in making them. Anyway just my theory, I wonder if I'm right or wrong.",2015-06-15T02:02:43.000Z,1

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"I wonder... why there are so many people raging upon furries and bronies in a trailer for a DISNEY MOVIE?

I don't see any good reason to feel rage on then. It's not like they are raping people.
Geez, you can't even tell if someone is furry just by looking to them.

People who like animes aren't hated. Furries do. One likes japanese-ish thigs. Other likes anthropomorphic animals. Is this a problem?

As far as I know, straight from furries themselves, they do not feel like going into zoophilia. And there's a bunch of comments in this video exacly about this.
I know that somebody will read this and comment ""NO DUDE, SURE THEY RAPE ALL ANIMOLZ, THEY'RE MUNZTERS AND SINNARZ THEY DEZEARV DEATH"".
As far as I know, every rule has exceptions.
There are ""normal"" people who feels atraction to animals. There are ""normal"" people who does not. There are people from the first group that never would have sex with an animal, and people from the second group that already did it.

Geez. Why do people hate each other? They can't take care about their own lives?
If someone isn't hurting another human or animal, and even vegetables... why would you bother?
That's looks like jealousy. Some people can't see others being themselves, doing what they like, they start calling others ""sinners"", ""furfags"", bla, bla, bla, etc.

Black people suffered something that, somehow, is the same as LGBT, furries, religious people (from ANY religion) and atheits are suffering today.
There's nothing wrong with any of these. But people do think they're wrong.

What's the problem on having a black skin? They are EXACLTY as everyone else, they're human, they have feelings, they have needs.

What is wrong about believing in God, Budha, or Zeus? People always did this and will always do. Religion helps people overcome problems, religion (should) teaches faithful people to respect and love each other, no matter the differences between they, and it also says that ""Only the ~~insert divinity here~~ can judge""

What is wrong about being atheist? ""YOU WILL BURN IN HELL, U SINARZ, GOD WILL MAEK U SUFFAR"" No. Don't ever say this to an atheist. They don't believe on it, they won't start believing with a someone raging and shouting that they're bound to hell. That will never help an atheist to believe on any religion. Come on, lots of atheits are much better people than the religious people, and the last ones have HUNDREDS of rules to follow about ""respect each other, love each other, don't judge each other..."" but still they do this.
Kinda strange, I think, because they rage so hard about how the atheit's sins, but raging about it is a sin as well, and they don't regret this sin.

Human beings are strange. Human beings are very different from each other. And this is good. Nature proves it. If everyone was exacly the same, there would be no one of us to ever find this out.

IF you still think i'm wrong... try to do this: everytime you will let all your rage fall upon someone, think about WHY you are feeling that rage and WHAT you think that is WRONG and try to understand if that is really wrong. You can also change the ones who are being attacked by your senseless rage. Try to change ""furry"" with another kind of people... ""straight"", ""LGBT"", ""muslims"", ""black""... if the phrase still makes sense, there is something wrong.

E.G.: ""Furries suck. Why do I think this? What is wrong about them?
I don't like they because they like animals too much and this is wrong, but... wait, that's does not looks like a problem, they're not raping animals at all""
""Straights suck. Why do I think this? What is wrong about them?
I don't like they because they like animals too much and this is wrong, but... wait, that's does not looks like a problem, they're not raping animals at all""

Yeah, I know... This ""machine"" I did sucks a lot, but I made sense when I was writing it. If it was on my mother language, it would be a lot better. ~Comment ""Eu li tudo"" if you read everything~

Oh my gods........ just stop. We're all HUMAN. So treat each other like HUMANS. It doesn't matter if he's a furry, or if she's atheist, or if she's gay, or if he's a nerd, or...........
IT DOESN'T MATTER
None of these people are hurting ANYONE!

Do you think THIS was Walt Disney's idea for the word? To create a sea of hate over a movie about a FOX? NO! Walt Disney wanted nothing more than to remind us that there is magic in the world, that there is hope.

I've lost near all faith in humanity now. I know people who are furries, I know people who are not. I know people who are Christian, I am not. I know people who are straight, I know people who are not. They are all sweet people, the best of friends to me, and they wouldn't hurt ANYONE.

SO WHY CAN'T YOU ALL BE NICE TO EACH OTHER GODS IT'S NOT THAT HARD!

Please...... I'm asking you to just stop fighting..... there's enough hate in the world.

Because I bet one thing you never thought about is the person you just called a name could be crying in front of their computer screen, afraid to be themselves because of the cruel words of people they've never met. And you would never know.",2015-06-14T19:17:29.000Z,1

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"They hate on gays, people who are just trying to be true to their sexuality.

They hate on disabled people, even though they didn't choose to be this way and might be trying to find a cure.

They hate on minorities, people who just aren't white.

They hate on whites, people who just happen to be the dominant race.

They hate on theists, just because they believe in god(s) which they feel exists and can't see it any other way.

They hate on atheists, just because they don't think ANY deity is really there.

They hate on furries, just because they're part of an art form.

They hate on people who are different, just because they aren't the same and that alone makes them an enemy.

Notice something about all these haters? They're all the SAME. Hate something that's different, hate something that's benign, hate something that doesn't even effect them. They ALL do this so wouldn't it be nice if these haters actually were against something malevolent such as injustice like forced education or political tyranny rather than something that's just different? Prejudge people who are different, insult people who are different, even bully/beat up/kill someone is different. They did throughout history and they're still doing it do this day. They act like they're standing out by trying to be powerful with their hate but they're really just blending in with all the other bad people in the world. ""You laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same.""¬†

Guess people should actually stop hating if they want to get somewhere meaningful in life. The different people spent their lives well being true to themselves, the haters just wasted their lives being destructive.

Guess they won't really be missed by anyone who really matters...",2015-06-14T01:38:55.000Z,3

What is it with people and hating Anthropomorphic animals?
Hey geniuses, not all furries draw or enjoy porn.
Furries are not all about porn, and if you think that, I highly recommend checking out a webcomic called ""Zoophobia"".
I actually think this is a pretty funny concept. Besides, we have cartoons like Mikey Mouse, Looney Tunes and MANY others, where animals are Anthropomorphic. They don't have anything to do with Furry porn.¬†
Seriously, having Animals as main characters has been around forever and I really like that idea.
Besides, EVERYTHING has porn. Everything. So shut the hell up.

Anyways, for some reason, I just can't get enough of this trailer, I find myself coming back to it time and time again.
The animation is very smooth and the expressions are pretty nice and the concept of the trailer is hilarious, especially with the narrator expressing little to no emotion, and I like the fact that natural enemies don't get along.
I also like how they walk differently, similar to how animals walk differently.

Yes there are reason to connect the two, one the names being similar and two, the silly pun.

Though Zoophobia is a cool comic and I check up on it weekly myself, I doubt a percentage of people working on this film has ever came across this comic and just figured up a title for the film sort like the author to the comic did. One placed phobia cause the main character is scared of said animals. The other Topia because its a city full of anthros.¬†

After a mighty battle with his enemy and a daring rescue of a little girl from radioactive doom, our yet unnamed hero returns to his home, exhausted and a mess...ew...radioactive sweaty super-underwear...atleast it's the outer pair for over his pants. ANYWAY. He casually tosses his dirty clothes in the hamper despite his wife yelling from downstairs to remember his costume goes in the special bin not the regular hamper, and he tiredly staggers off to take a shower. Welllll....when he steps out and goes to find some clean clothes for the evening, the hamper is missing. His wife screams from down stairs and as he rushes awkwardly down the stairs in his towel, he discovers a now LIVING clothes hamper monster trying to eat his wife's oven mit while she tries to wrestle the mit back. The creature panics and escapes, and soon reports of a wandering laundry monster stealing and eatting people's socks pop up all over the neighborhood. People from all walks and groups try to stop the beast, but it keep escaping. A lazy little boy discovers the hamper monster in his backyard, and finds out if he feeds the monster his dirty clothes...he doesn't have to wash them. Ever. So he decides to try and hide it and keep it as a pet, to make cleaning his room easier. Adventure, childhood pet keeping love, drama, and a few tense scenes ensue and in a dramatic battle between the hero hubby in deep doo doo and the hamper monster who mistakenly thinks he has to defend or protect the boy from the hero...the hamper breaks. All smelly missing laundry appears in a massive pile from seemingly out of no where in the middle of the road where the hamper now lay ordinary, plastic, and broken in half. The boy begins to weep. Falling to his knees and bawling, something stirs in the mountain of lost dirty clothes...a pile of baby hamper beasts no bigger than decks of cards leap up and scatter off away. People shriek but the boy is over joyed. These tiny hamper monsters move into homes all acrossed the globe, hiding behind clothes dryers and feasting on the left socks of the world.",2015-06-13T02:09:44.000Z,0

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"This trailer gets so many things wrong, it just make me cringe.¬† Let's list them, shall we?
- Right off the bat:¬† Humans *are* animals.¬† You can try and separate them all you want, but humans belong to same Kingdom Animalia as every other mammal, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, and invertebrate.¬† Would have been better to say, ""This is not a human."" instead of ""This is an animal.""
- Anthropomorphised means ""human-like"" in every meaning of the word... not just ""it basically walks on two legs"".¬† If that were the case, then every animal that already walks on two legs is ""anthropomorphic"" when they plainly aren't.
- Foxes have hearing far superior to rabbits.
- Crotch-cover when mentioning clothes.¬† Nothing to see in the first place.¬† That old schtick is getting tired.¬† Not to mention, most furred animals have no need for clothes.
- Technology use:¬† Not limited to humans.¬† Many animals use tools, via trial and error, a very basic version of ""the scientific method"".¬†
- Ignoring the pun:¬† Something we haven't seen before... with everything you've mentioned is in this movie?¬† Ignoring, what, the dozens if not hundreds of animated features from around the world, Disney included, that feature nothing but anthropomorphic animals wearing clothes and doing human-like activities in natural conflict between their relative species?¬† I don't think so.
- Be-fur.¬† Puns.¬† No.¬† Puns are bad.¬† Especially puns that end in ""fur"".

I get the impression this trailer was made by a Furry... featuring all the retardation that comes with being one.  It even sounds like it was narrated by a Furry.",2015-06-13T01:11:27.000Z,0

Okay what's the plot? What's the conflict? Who's the protagonist? We get nothing from this. It's pretty much banking on furries to go see it. I don't care if you're into that. It's your life, do whatever. But for the rest of us, this should be a pass.",2015-06-13T00:16:58.000Z,0
2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"I'll jump on the bandwagon too because I love when people bash furries like me...

This movie is actually pretty adorable. The fox alone has so much expression with just his ears. His shoulders, hands, tail, hips, all scream his emotions with out him having to say a word or even grumble! Animation has come so far and I'm actually kinda excited to see what the story of this movie will be. If there even is a story. It could just be, ""Let's follow a fox through his life in Zootopia.""

Of course, as this is an animated movie with anthropomorphic animals in it, it will attract a huge amount of attention from Furries. We're fans of this schit, what do you expect? Some people will find an erotic niche, some will find a duplication(because replication is a sign of appreciation) niche, and others will enjoy or hate the film for their own reasons.

Some extreme furries might come in with their furry gear and get their furry all over the theater, others might come as generic moviegoers secretly stroking their affinity for anthros. And another chunk of people /will/ be generic movie goers, come to see what the movie has to offer.

News networks, mainly Fox News, will be more than delighted to jump on the ""Let's rip open Furries for being different in a slightly extreme way."" bandwagon and happily rip Furries a new one... Again. Coming up with the obvious, ""Furries have been caught /masturbating/ to the film Zootopia in the theaters... Can you believe it? A bunch of grown men and women in animal costumes are coming to theaters, in public, sitting down and masturbating in front of other people with each other.""

This movie is going to attract a certain kind of people because it meets a certain kind of people's attractions and affinities. It will attract a smaller kind of people as it meets their creative desires and an even smaller amount of people as it meets their creative and sexual needs to replicate and to twist into a sexual light. Its almost guaranteed to make at least some kind of news as it will be very controversial because of the Furry following.

In other words... If you want to watch the movie but you fall ill by the very idea of people enjoying animals so much that they themselves would dress in animals as a way of replicating and appreciating, then sit at home for a month of two. Wait for the movie to come out on DVD or get published all over the internet. it'll be about the same cost or even free. And you can avoid being made ill. Win win if you ask me.

Oh, and yes, more Furries need to learn to take one for the team and mock themselves. If the mockery reaches Furry to Furry levels then it'll become one giant circle jerk and eventually all the mean spirited comments like, ""Furries are the scum of the Earth"" will cease to have really any meaning. It will eventually fight Po's law of shit being done so much as a parody that when things are meant to be a real attempt they won't be seen as real, they'll be seen as more parody.

I draw them on occassion for fun but have never really indulged into fur suits and all that jazz.

The only thing that bothers me about these kinds of 'worlds' is what do the animals eat??? If they eat each other is it considered a form of cannibalism or murder?? Or are they all vegetarians?? Or are they SEMI-VEGETARIANS (which would mean chickens and fish aren't inclusive of being 'sentient' anthro animals)?

First, this isn't a ""furry"" movie; that would be like saying Cat's Don't Dance, Robin Hood, Tail Spin,¬†etc are ""furry"" movies/shows. Furries are¬†a certain type of¬†fan, not the name of the concept of anthropomorphic societies.¬†Now,¬†I certainly don't¬†have a problem with the furry fandom¬†or with them¬†anticipating this movie (I'm not wishing death on them like some of you homicidal people down there).


¬†Second, the idea of an¬†animal only society has existed for a¬†*long* time in movies and children's tales and is not an original concept. Now this doesn't mean Disney can't use this concept as some¬†actually seem to¬†believe; it's certainly not a copyrighted idea. Disney used to use this a lot in the past with it's cartoons so you are being silly acting like because Chicken Little exists means that this movie will be just like it.

I mean it's not like they all do it, but it is a SIZEABLE cross section of the porn on the internet. It's nothing to be ashamed of, in fact everybody watches porn so it's no surprise that things like ""yiffs"" exist, I don't see why they are so defensive about it.

In der Welt von Zootopia, gibt es keine Menschen.
Zootopia ist, eine moderne, zivilisierte, Welt...
...welche total tiereisch ist!
Das, ist ein Tier.
Tiere in Zootopia, sind anthroposophisch...
...was nur eine aufgeblasene Formulierung daf√ºr ist,
das sie auf zwei Beinen gehen,
sie nicht nackt zur Arbeit gehen.
Danke

Das is besser
Und sie nutzten Technologie
Ok, hier sind S√§ugetiere, des ganzen Planeten, in Zootopia
Gro√üe und Kleine, schnell und tr√§ge
Aber die Wahrheit ist, Zootopia is' nicht perfekt.
Und wie in unsrer' Welt, gibt es Reiberein...
...speziell nat√ºrliche Feinde!
Was, zu Problemen, f√ºhrn' kann...
...aber Tiere haben nat√ºrliche √úberlebensf√§higkeiten...w√§hrend einer Finstersicht hat...h√∂rt der andere besonders gut!

I feel sorry for her. Since Disney is an empire in animation and motion picture industry, she can't do anything about it. I would feel terribly awful too if someone bigger and more well-known than me came along, took my idea, bent it a little and said ""Hey! Look at this completely original movie I just made up myself!"", while I sat in the corner with a comic I've been working on for 8 years, carefully and wholeheartedly devoting myself to, and I could do nothing to change it.

You don't have to be a child to find anthropomorphic animals to be funny or cute. Most of use grew up with anthropomorphic animals that we watched.
Liking anthropomorphic animals, finding them cute or funny doesn't make you a furry. Even if you are, there's nothing wrong with that and people need to stop finding films like these as an excuse to bash a harmless community.
This is also DISNEY. Much of what they have done involves anthropomorphic animals. Why should this surprise anyone?

Disney, YOU have used anthropomorphic creatures in almost all of your movies. This concept itself, of a world made of entirely anthropomorphic animals, is also /not/ an original idea, which you seem to be attempting to pass it off as. There's this thing called the ""furry community"" (an actually great crowd full of good people that has an unfortunate and unjustified reputation). I'm not complaining, stories/worlds like this are great! And the furry community could definitely use some positive exposure. I just feel like it's kind of a kick in the leg to the countless people who have made stories and graphic novels like this when you say it's ""like nothing seen before."" Other than that little line, this seems amazing, and I'm pretty excited for it! I'd just be nice if you stopped advertising it in a way that makes it seem like you're trying to sell it as an original concept.

My NSFW is purely of my own OC, whose body is drawn in reference to my own, since she's literally ""a furry persona"". Similar to if someone draws a cartoon or anime version of themselves. I can't vouch for other furries, but I love this movie and it won't be used pornographically by me.

2015-06-11T15:58:28.000Z,g9lmhBYB11U,Zootopia US Teaser Trailer,"Like nothing you seen be-fur"". Wow Disney is pretty full of themselves. This so far from being original it's pathetic. (excluding the furry community) Here's a short list of shows and movies that have already done this decades before this film: Swat Kats, Chicken Little, Tale Spin, Duck Tales, Darkwing Duck, The Paw Paws, Thundercats, Babar, Samurai Pizza Cats, Fantomcat, Disneys Robin Hood. But the one thing that Zootopia does different, seems to be the only movie of it's kind to focus a lot on the fact that there are no humans. They're trying to make it seem like They're unique for being aware of this. As if Disney is doing something new, groundbreaking and unheard of. Disney reeks of arrogance.",2015-06-12T02:32:55.000Z,0

Seriously though, this Nick Wilde character seems to have a character description that suits my personality, and he has the sleepy green eyes like I do ^~^. I'm just nervous now that their going to mess it up with the standard plot motions of pairing two people together (one of them being annoying), having them progressively get along, then use that very overused misunderstanding cliche, then cue a sad pop song, then cue hijinks, then he and the bunny kiss, the end.

I'm hoping if they ARE going to do that, they at least make it not so painful...because I really want to like this movie.",2015-06-12T01:47:45.000Z,0

So I won't rain on their parade and mention PlayStation's Sly Cooper, Hanna Barbera's SWAT Kats, Nintendo's Star Fox, Dreamwork's Kung Fu Panda or Nickolodeon's Tuff Puppy.

The idea of animals acting as humans is not new especially for Disney. Usually when Disney uses anthropomorphic animals, it is to make a twist upon a tale or trope used before. The only twist here it seems is that humans are animals. Reading the plot from the description, the only way I can see it being interesting is if the small herbivore versus big carnivore animals were symbolism to racism or some sort of discrimination but if it's only the rabbit that is being bullied then the idea of this doesn't seem that original to me.",2015-06-12T00:43:19.000Z,0

Mine was about humans nearly going extinct from a major plague so the leading scientists of the world saved two of each animal (like Noah's Arc) and gave them human intelligence so that when mankind was gone, their legacy would still live on earth. In the future, the animals evolved from the experiments and became anthro, wore clothes and built civilizations (except unlike Zootopia's animals, they're against technology) but they still have the same flaws that humans had: They separate themselves by species and fight with each other.

Rabbit girl want to be acknowledge for her police skill or is stuck with traffic duty but want to prove herself to be a good cop. She some how witness a crime and cant do it alone and try to get help for the cops that do heavier police work but they don't listen or they go out and find nothing a few times and gave up listening to her. She comes across a fox who could be a eye witness the this crime or have some role or have information on the crime. But also notice that he had a warrant for his arrest or she witness a criminal act that he had done (mostly scamming someone) and blackmailed him to help her to find the criminals and bring them in. As they search for clues they fought along the way but later gain respect for each other (maybe after they tell there personal stories) as they closed in they end she wanted to do everything herself but the fox suggested to calling backup. But after going in and trying to take down the bad guys they end up failing and getting captured and out of some reason the hideout gets destroyed and altered the other cops just to find the two and she end up losing her job and (if the fox had a warrant) he would be put into prison. After sometime in depression after losing her job she encourage herself out of some reason and brakes the fox out of jail (of he encourage her to try again out of some reason). and goes out and try again and succeed (the evil boos might be killed or arrested) and then ends up getting her job back.
The fox might join the force, walk of into the sunset, or ends up in some relationship with her if they go the romance way.

As for the characters I know the fox and bunny is the main but mostly the fox. As for support characters, I think there is gonna be a kinda of a sidekick for the fox maybe a weasel that helps him with some black-market goods or information. And I'm guessing there might be some connection with him in the movie villain and yes I know there is one, theirs always one. I'm not sure what he is gonna be, as for the cops, many top of the food chain and large and strong animals and I'm guessing the commissioner maybe a Lion. And I'm guessing there might be a scene she heads to her parents house and her mom and dad thought she brought home a boyfriend and she could be living with them to

As for personality goes, the Fox is a scammer with a smooth talk to talk his way out of anything. a smartas* but short sighted. The bunny is cleaver, mommas girl or daddy's girl or both,... ok that's all I can think up on.

Post what you think is gonna happen and there personality's",2015-06-11T19:31:21.000Z,0
