This is the only one that improves on the original cartoon movie. The BatB and Aladdin had terrible singing (auto-tuned Belle, anyone?) and low-energy musical scenes (everything in Aladdin) and pointless changes to the story (Jasmine's whole character, filler CGI chase scene with mutant Iago) and needless addition of modern politics (Belle's feminism). I love that this Cinderella celebrates traditional femininity, kindness and forgiveness. Every other Disney movie is now about STRONK INDEPENDENT WAMEN WHO DON'T NEED NO MAN, as if leaning on other people = dependent and is something to be ashamed of, and how revenge and evil getting paid with evil is something to strive for.",2019-06-04T15:28:01.000Z,1

An abusive step mother, The jealous aunt and her two competitive daughters, the birds I loved feeding, an angel who came in to my life to make me realize God's love for me and above all a beautiful set of parents who always taught me good values like kindness n love. and yes the house story too. I even noticed some of the dialogues in the movie tht I had with my dad. I don't expect a prince charming to come becoz i know God is my only lover.

Rewatching this film, I think it beats Beauty and the Beast storywise. I was touched by the ending of BATB, cried a little. But this one, f*ck, it's more touching. Cried when fairy godmother transformed her, cried when she arrived at the palace, and cried in the end.

BATB beats Cinderella in music, though. But Sonna Rele's Strong is a really great song.

Looking forward to more Disney remakes.",2019-01-10T23:19:09.000Z,9

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"What being a princess has always meant to me.

1. Being independent.

2. Doing what's right even if all disagree.

3. Achieving the best in all that I do.

4. Being a leader.

5. Understanding that while I may be bigger, I am not better than any of the little bugs that crawl outside.

6. Finding new ways for myself to grow.

7. Learning the valuable lesson of hard work.

8. Educating myself in simple ways, it means no college.

9. Being humble enough to understand that I am not better than others.

10. Seeing the beauty in nature and understanding that life is an adventure, verses a destination. 

11. Finding my own way out of any destructive path I may find myself on.

Being a princess has never been about living in a castle or having the finest stuff in life. It is not about glamour for me or the superficial nature of things.

It is about who I am on the inside where no one else can see.",2018-10-14T16:04:33.000Z,0

But since you CAN balance small stones one on top of another anywhere on Earth, Earth cannot possibly be a spinning oblate spheroid. Besides, if the earth's supposed centrifugal force can be perfectly cancelled out by ""gravity"" at the equator, then you should feel ""gravity"" twice as strongly at the North Pole since there is no centrifugal force there. Do we? Nope. Earth isn't spinning. Gravity has NEVER been scientifically proven whereas density/buoyancy have been. The Propensity Of Density > The Depravity Of Gravity.

I mean, who would have guessed that a fairy tale could be made over to really show you what love is all about? Amazing that they did that. Bravo, Disney! There's a line in the movie, something along the lines of how the ""bravest thing you can do is show someone who you really are"". (I've got the line wrong, but the idea of it right!)  :-)  That is SO TRUE. Showing your true self, warts and all, to someone, is incredibly hard and incredibly amazing and one of the most phenomenon experiences on earth when they love you anyway, just as you are.",2018-08-20T16:50:55.000Z,3

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,From the trailer I thought I was going yo hate this movie but I'm glad I watched It. It was beautiful. Why am I not surprised though that people are talking about race?! The fact that you guys give a fuck that there were black actors in this movie is sad. Cinderella was created in 7th century Bc. That means around the year 1160. Black people were not slaves back then and its quite possible that there could have been black nobility seeing as how Egyptians were the first to do The whole royalty thing.

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"I found this movie completely contradicts with the ideas it's trying to sale the audience on. It trying to promote the idea of not to marry for advantage or money, instead we should marry for love. I found this to be hilarious because Ella marry a prince who's rich, tall and handsome. And ironically enough, Cinderella was a hot bombshell. I think if Disney really want to brain wash kids or whoever else still buys into this kind of crap nowadays that they should marry for love, then at least create a story that's more realistic for god sake. Like instead of letting Cinderella marry Prince Charming, they should let her marry a fatass butcher or servant. Moreover, instead of letting Prince Charming marry a hot bombshell, they should let him marry an ugly 200 pound girl. This way the movie would have been at least some what  meaningful, otherwise this movie just made me felt like I was watching a PG rated version of 50 shades of grey.",2015-09-09T05:29:50.000Z,0

Because what exactly makes a girl 'courageous and kind' if she can't even be kind to herself? Little Cinderella needs a spine. My 4 year old has a better grip on human psychology than this bimbo version of Cinderella. In America, 3 women die every day in the hands on an abusive husband or boyfriend.

Explanation 1 = 
The other stuff was changed into something else, like lizard to footman, pumpkin to carriage. Now, Ella's shoes wasn't changed. She took her OLD shoes off her feet in the movie and then the fairy godmother made NEW shoes which is the glass one. So the other stuff turned back to what it was before and the shoes she wore to the party was already at its original form. It is not changed. It is already made like that. 

Explanation 2 = Everything is possible in a movie.

I think the strong actors really made you actually care when I was expecting it to be very shallow and too cartoonish to really take seriously. I know Cate gets all the big camp moments with the villain but I actually think its Lily James who carries the movie overall. She strikes the perfect balance between nice and charming but also feisty and strong; this bitch really knows who she is and will not let anybody spoil her day or wipe that optimistic smile off her face. She will not cry over being treated like shit by her step family or ever be a doormat to any man. Nor will she wait for some white knight to come get her; she was determined to go to that fucking ball and get that dick. Way ahead of her time. I believed in the chemistry between the two lovers. I also thought the King & princes relationship was touching especially the deathbed scene where the prince was curled up on the bed like a little boy. It had some very human moments. Again, it goes back to the actors playing it for real; Derek jacobi has such a strong presence as the king & both he and Cate gave the film strong theatrical credibility. But its Lilys film. Plus I love that they stayed faithful to the Disney classic. Fuck modern twists we have enough modern reality films.",2015-06-16T02:38:42.000Z,1

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,What a FANTASTIC movie!!! I couldn't spot not one thing wrong with this movie! Yea Helena had a small role but its perfect because if given more she would have distracted from the full film plus in the animated version the role is the same. Im so glad they didn't make any huge changes like the last two films where snow white becomes a joan of arc type or in maleficent where they make the evil villain a not so evil person. The only thing i wish i could change about this movie (and yet i wouldn't because they did it beautifully well) was when the step mother was explaining why she treated Cinderella as she did she kind of stopped mid sentence and stormed off in anger which left me wanting more :))) Such a teese,2015-04-23T19:51:33.000Z,1

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"I read something very interesting on tumblr the other day, which has made me much more excited to see this movie. A lady was commenting on how most people see Cinderella as such a passive, non feminist story, because the girl hardly has any power and doesn't stand up to her stepfamily. But, this lady said, the story is actually very empowering in that Ella never once is cruel or vindictive or selfish, despite the horrible abuse she faces in her own home. The empowerment comes from Ella being able to stay good and pure of heart despite her hardships, and if u think she should have stood up against her abusers, you've obviously never heard a victim or survivor talk about how hard it is to defend yourself against it. It can be dangerous, even lethal, to try and leave your abusers home, and in that time period? Forget about it. So no, she doesn't fight, but yes, she is a good role model in that she endures and hopes and stays kind and generous despite others being so unkind to her. She is breaking the cycle of abuse--and that is a very powerful, incredible thing to happen in a story like this. As Ellas mum says, where there is kindness, there is goodness. And where there us goodness, there is magic.",2015-04-16T06:41:38.000Z,1

It's unbelievable what beauty a computer can create nowadays! And, as I know, the half of this great film was shot in real English palaces, it's amazing! Plus, costumes of the characters were just mind-blowing!!! Also actors were very suitable, like every person was on its place... There were 2 or 3 touching moments, and my parents even cried happy tears in the end, I reckon it's wonderful, because they literally remembred about magic, youth and fairy tales!!! In other words, Cinderella has got everything! You definitely MUST see it!!!!!!!! :D (P.S. I did not expect this film to be so awesome)))))))",2015-03-29T19:37:34.000Z,8

Keen to support her loving father, Ella welcomes her new stepmother Lady Tremaine and her daughters Anastasia and Drizella into the family home. But when Ella’s father suddenly and unexpectedly passes away, she finds herself at the mercy of a jealous and cruel new family. Finally relegated to nothing more than a servant girl covered in ashes, and spitefully renamed Cinderella since she used to work in the cinders, Ella could easily begin to lose hope. Yet, despite the cruelty inflicted upon her, Ella is determined to honor her mother’s dying words and to “have courage and be kind.” She will not give in to despair nor despise those who abuse her. And then there is the dashing stranger she meets in the woods. Unaware that he is really a prince, not merely an employee at the palace, Ella finally feels she has met a kindred soul.

I think it's a good idea to check history before speaking and forever being branded as a racist in public. People of African heritage were a common part of life in Europe for centuries. Before society began to put ""white"" ""black"" labels on people, race was not an issue. There were black nobleman during the 12th and 13th century in Europe. They were respected and seen as anyone else. They were guests of kings and queens due to their nobleman status. They weren't different. Their dark skin was just seen as another human feature.
Also, skeletal remains of a high society black male were found in the rumble of the Mount Vesuvius eruption which destroyed Pompeii, Greece in 79 AD. There are many many examples of people of Hispanic, African, and Asian heritage in European society and vice versa (Europeans in other culture's society). It's ridiculous how we are today. There's not white, black, mexican (which, if they weren't born in Mexico or have heritage from Mexico, can you please stop calling a person Mexican), or Chinese (same applies here). We are all an amazing mix of culture and heritage. Love yourself and love others as Jesus loves you. Respect all people and appreciate what all cultures have contributed to our way of life, from combing your hair (the comb started in Persia, which is Iranian) to the gas mask in WWI that has saved thousands of lives (which was invented by a black man in 1916). Every one of us matter.",2015-03-26T13:07:38.000Z,1

There were no big changes to the story like with Maleficent, only some extra padding to give each character a more fleshed out background, which lets be real here - the Prince was in dire need of.

Definitely the best of Disney's live-action adaptations as of yet and certainly proves that one doesn't need to go the ""Darker and Edgier"" route when it comes to remakes.

tl;dr - Multitudes of levels better than Maleficent, go see Cinderella if you want to leave the theater with a warm and fuzzy feeling in your belly instead of the hollow empty one you got from the former.",2015-03-18T16:16:21.000Z,1

A) in case the astoundingly time-period accurate costumes, hair, and architecture have confused you, this film doesn't take place in medieval France. It very very super duper clearly takes place in a fictitious fantasy universe that has fairy godmothers and glass dancing shoes. If they pulled a black casting choice in something like Ever After (a legitimate period piece) I would be distracted by it there, but not here.
B) The Cinderella story originated in China. If it's so ""offensive"" to so many whites that a colored Cinderella be portrayed in a European story, why is nobody up in arms about the Europeans who put a white girl in an Asian story?

I like the 2015 Cinderella but the film has basically been remade a million of times. The trailer and actors look good, but everyone knows the story. If they added a twist or made it darker, then maybe more people would watch it. Disney's film adaptation of Alice and Wonderland was successful because, there was a twist. Anyway not many kids nowdays know about the tale of Mulan, or Pocohantas since there are never remakes of those movies, and they came out years ago in the 90's. I'm happy Beauty and the Beast is being remade, since there hasn't been a new film adaptation of it for a long time. Disney remake films that haven't been remade yet.",2015-03-17T14:54:21.000Z,6

I scroll through the comments and everyone is up in arms about black people not being in a movie based on a European folk tale, that is several hundred years old, and based around Medieval Europe, yet not one comment has to do with the fact that this is a movie that plenty of young girls will watch, and that Cinderella, who is the main character, and will be idolised by these girls, has a waist the same size as her head! Firstly, you don't hear white people getting up in arms when movies with primarily black casts come out (Selma for instance). And secondly, it shows what people care about more. Between the racism and unhealthy female beauty standards in this movie, one is an imaginary pin prick, while the other is a very real slap in the face. And people are choosing to complain over the first one. There are far more appropriate areas to fight racism than a movie that has completely different problems that need to be addressed.",2015-03-16T01:40:12.000Z,0

""Why are they all white"" ... because it's a European fairy-tale where the original characters were white. I wouldn't expect a black girl to play Cinderella just like I wouldn't accept a white girl playing Mulan. The roles of foreign Royalty were clearly played by other races in the trailer because that's what makes sense.

""Why isn't she prettier"" ... she's naturally pretty, you're just a twat who thinks fake tan, dyed hair, and bleached teeth = beauty.

It was a beautiful film in every way.  The settings, the clothes and all the other little details were absolutely picturesque.  The acting was brilliant - I even teared up at some parts.  And the lesson of the entire story wasn't overdone to the point of being cheesy, but emphasized enough that I left the theater feeling so good about the world and wanting to ""have courage and be kind.""  And sure, the argument could be made that the movie is still a silly fairy tale teaching young girls that women need men or it's good to be a pushover or whatever else people are coming up with these days, but I really don't think every movie needs to feature some rebellious, ""badass,"" ""strong and independent"" girl who absolutely refuses to be married or believe in anything beyond the confines of her own eyes.  There is nothing wrong with encouraging gentleness, unconditional kindness and faith in true love and magic.  In fact, in our ever-changing and robotic society, we could use a little magic every now and then.  ",2015-03-15T04:27:31.000Z,1

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"SPOILERS AHEAD:
So this movie, I felt did an okay job, but I still enjoyed the original cartoon version. I like the fact that they showed what happened to the mother, which is something that they didn't show in the original. The message was better stated here and the graphics were pretty great. Also, it had a nice twist with the stepmother breaking her glass slipper. But some of the main points weren't well presented in this film. The death of the father was sudden and it was thought that he was killed by the stepmother in the original, unlike the new one where he had an accident. Cinderella was a servant basically for eight years in the original, which makes her kindness more extraordinary as she had the patience with dealing her step family, even when she had to do so many chores without help and even several times if a minor mistake was made. This one, however, she was the only servant for less than a year, half of which she had help from the other servants. So she didn't really feel the abuse for a long period of time. The animals in this one were alive for an unusual amount of time because the average lifespan of a mouse is only 2 years, and these mice have been with Cinderella since she was 8 (so about 8 years). Also, Cinderella is her name, not a nick name. For her to take the name given to her by her stepsisters instead by her parents is kind of an insult. Sure you can say that it serves as a constant reminder of her abuse, but again, that wasn't for long period of time. Had she been enslaved at age 8, like the original one, I will accept it, but less than a year isn't long enough. Also, the fairy god mother was more like a hot sister than a gentle mother. They should have casted someone like Betty White or Judi Dench to give that lovely persona. Also, the tearing of the dress wasn't as saddening as the original. The stepmother tore the sleeve and the front part, which was pretty sad, but not as sad as the original when the sisters tore it up so much, and when the mother just smiled and left her there without so much as a forbidding Cinderella from going to the ball. ",2015-03-15T00:29:26.000Z,0

You know, for everyone in the dark side of the comments who is complaining about how diversity is ruining society and how Cinderella is a ""European fairy-tale"" I would just like to point out two things.

1.) The very first original Cinderella was an Egyptian fairy tale. It was about a Greek slave girl named Rhodopis who eventually married the King of Egypt. So no, it actually is not a ""European fairy-tale.""

2.) So...it's perfectly okay for the mice turn into horses, the pumpkins to turn into carriages, for dresses to materialize via magic, and for fairy godmothers to exist, but God forbid they portray another human being with a darker skin color in a freakin make believe story!!! O.O HOLY CRAP IT'S A SIGN OF THE APOCALYPSE!!! DDDDDDDDDDD: 

On one side, it's hilarious. On the other, it's really sad. smdh.",2015-03-14T17:06:46.000Z,13

-Little Ella running through the meadow.

-Ella and her mother saving the bird.

-The line ""Where there is kindness, there is goodness, and where there is goodness, there is magic."" was cut.

-The line ""...so I'll know as faraway as I may be, that you will be safe."" was cut.

-The dialogue between the guests at Lady Tremaine's party - one of them making a sexist remark - was cut.

-The servants reacting to the Lady Tremaines' demands.

-The servants being dismissed was there, but the dialogue was removed.

-The brief conversation between Lady Tremaine and Ella: ""What on earth have you been doing?"" she asks her stepdaughter rather cruelly. Ella's soft-spoke response: ""Dreaming."" It's after this sweet quiet moment when Lady Tremaine grows louder with her response: ""Then wake up!""

-Some of the dialogue in the fencing scene was cut.

-The dialogue during the Royal Ball announcement was shortened.

-The dialogue explaining that the glass slippers would be a memento was cut.

-The Grand Duke and Royal Guard questioning Ella after the spell was broken.

-There is a scene after the wedding, but the movie ended with the wedding.

nothing makes me want to see this one except for Helena B.K. as the fairy godmother. she's brilliant at anything she does. 

all the rest just looks the same as we've seen before and even too...fake, plastic, pop-oriented, teenage like. no dept, no charm, no pure beauty or intrest, just more of what we have too much of as it is. 

they all look too perfect like models, and it's just...well, shallow and boring. 

i liked the ""Ever after"" version with Drew Barimore. it had something new to say, although it was far too long and twisted. and Angelica Huoston as the stepmother was exquisit.

Instead, the Stepmother is actually the heroine who save Cinderella through true love, the prince will turn out to be an evil prick and the cinematography, far too bright and not enough CGI.

People need to understand that this offends many people such as Native's, Asian, Mixed, Hispanics, Africans, etc. and for a princess film to be have everything changed in it except for the race of their characters hurts many people. Please stop and think before you judge because it's simply the truth that no one wants to admit and I think that is the entire issue we are in this mess in the first place. And what hurts many people the most is that, the people who are being racist are either overreacting, hating someones culture not their color, or *just being mean because they know they are across a screen*.

I am surrounded by black people (and I'm black myself) and I asked them what they think of this trailer and not a single one. Not. A. Single. One. complained about it being ""too white.""  I also checked several forums and the ones that mentioned this movie had no discussion about it being ""too white"" either.

You know why??  Because we have a Cinderella cartoon already that is all white so this is no surprise and this is not the first all-white Disney film.  Enchanted anyone?

All the people grumbling about ""blacks want to be in everything"" are taking the comments of a few people and using them as a platform to spew their own personal prejudices.  If there are blacks complaining about this movie they are in the minority, and not even a vocal minority at that as I have yet to see their comments.

My first and only thought after watching the trailer was that Disney is starting to run out of ideas, we really don't need a remake of their older classics in my opinion.",2015-01-24T04:36:31.000Z,1

Those years when the royal families were 'white'. I don't know, I love Disney princess so much💜. And I'm happy because of this movie. Like, really, get angry because the movie is 'too white'. Please understand it is a live action. Have you seen Cinderella before? I like the movie in this way. Cinderella is part of my childhood. I like the vintage feeling. For me, if they use African American actors would be either great, it is just the story what makes me whisper. Just don't talk shit about 'white' people because no one choose their race, I know in this world there's people who will judge because your skin colour or just by the way you look. But if you ask for equality it should begins in ourselves. Put African Americans (in a movie which original characters are white) won't make you better than others, I think no one needs a movie to tell you how special you are. Just enjoy the movie because it seems magnificent! I don't care about races. I don't see skin colour, I see soul colour. So even if a movie is full of English actors it doesn't mean you, Hispanic, African American, Asian, aren't special. Stop hate, please.🙏",2015-01-19T08:31:54.000Z,1

The Grimm Brothers were scholars who traveled around collecting stories they weren't ""original"" by any means, by which we may consider ""original."" With versions dating as early to Ancient Egypt and China, Cinderella has crossed boundaries, and with Roger and Hammerstein's Cinderella premiering on Disney back in the day with a black Cinderella (Brandy) and her Filipino prince, Disney could've easily added a diverse, interracial MAIN cast-not just a black princess. The prince's  parents in the above were black and white, yes. The Disney Fandom's racial entitlement is showing again.

I think Cinderella is a classic, timeless story and why should modernized views change that? Yes, it doesn't have a diverse cast - but other movies do. Look at Big Hero 6 for example. Plenty of viewers complained about the lack of diversity so they changed an originally all Asian cast to white, black, etc. yet the movie was criticized for cheap attempts at making the movie diverse. And yes most Cinderella adaptations always have the same endings yet, how would you feel if they suddenly decided to change the amazing plot line you grew up with? I'm glad they're making a live action version, yes I know what's going to happen but I feel like live action just brings it so much more to life. It feels almost magical just watching the trailer - why should you let the lack of cultural representation and 'overdone' plot stop you from enjoying it? ",2015-01-11T04:59:44.000Z,1

It is often considered the oldest known version of the story:

They tell the fabulous story that, when she was bathing, an eagle snatched one of her sandals from her maid and carried it to Memphis; and while the king was administering justice in the open air, the eagle, when it arrived above his head, flung the sandal into his lap; and the king, stirred both by the beautiful shape of the sandal and by the strangeness of the occurrence, sent men in all directions into the country in quest of the woman who wore the sandal; and when she was found in the city of Naucratis, she was brought up to Memphis, became the wife of the king ...",2015-01-10T22:22:24.000Z,0

Maybe the African plays a bigger part in the movie and they chose the best actor that could fulfill that role? Who knows? No one should judge because none of us are exactly screenwriters.

Also to those people being rude and saying there shouldn't be a black or coloured person in this at all, shut up. He's a slave anyway, so really there is no problem. Don't ruin this movie by saying it is European. I've read an Asian version of Cinderella and although they're not the same, they're similar. So really you can't open your mouth about who created what first. All this movie is doing is trying to end Racism but no people just have to start the racist call. Everyone is going to watch this movie whether they're European or not. I don't think people would be standing outside the cinema doors telling other people if they're not European then they cannot go see the movie. So just be kind and shut up.

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"I must say when Maleficent was first announced and I saw that Jolie was going to be playing her I thought it was a bizarre choice. I thought Helena Bonham Carter would've made a much better Maleficent, and to see her as the Fairy Godmother, to me, is also a bizarre choice of actress. When I think of a loving motherly figure I think more along the lines of Julie Andrews from Princess Diaries or Julie Walters from Harry Potter.

Having said all that about Carter, I do have to admit that this movie looks pretty impressive. They clearly gave the story and made it much more mature with Cinderella having met the Prince prior to the ball. Something that I don't recall being done since the Rodgers and Hammerstien musical with Brandy and Whitney Houston. 

I even saw another trailer of this film where (I think it was) the Prince's father basically called bullshit on the Prince's plan to find the woman he fell in love with by fitting the shoe. which was another clever touch to the film.

So overall I am impressed by this trailer but after a being disappointed by Maleficent, I'm going to try not to get my hopes up too high about this film.",2015-01-04T15:48:22.000Z,0

I'll agree it's a time sensitive piece that would make more sense with mainly Caucasians in it, but who cares one way or the other... It's Disney, they're going to put black or any other ethnicity person that they want in it.

Its a fairy tale that was writin in Europe way back in the day. There was not a lot of ethnic diversity back during the when these fairy tales were written. Sometimes it is necessary to keep the race of the characters into account for the movie to be believable. Look what happen to the last airbender, it was a disaster. It just didnt feel real because of all the ethnic diversity that was happening in an asian based world. Look at this movie. I do imagine this film to be predominately white because the story was written in a white eviornment. Having so many differents races wouldnt make the story feel believable.

i am asian, and i don't think they need to put asian as cinderella. because it is not the culture, time is wrong,place would be wrong, everything will be wrong. we got mulan, which was actuall old chinese story. they made that to movie. isn;t that cool? i am japanese. do i complain that why don't we have japanese as mulan? never. i guess in the states people see themselves as american no matter what race so , it's not that simple,there is more conflict, i get that.
but why not pay respect your own race.your roots, instead of trying to put your race in white people's shoes?
instead of complaining about old story that was based on place and time full of whites, we can try find a story of african princess. something that inspires the kids. i hope i am making sense. ",2015-01-01T14:50:56.000Z,0

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"Btw, Frozen was actually based from The Snow Queen fairy tale. And Elsa was the villain(though I'm not 100% sure). 

Maleficent were Sleeping Beauty- from Grimm's Fairy tales' Briar Rose. And there were actually 12 faeries, one of them was 'Maleficent'. The princess' name wasn't Aurora, but Briar Rose instead. 

Cinderella- came from Grimm's Fairy Tales too, though it has different versions from different European countries. The 'Cinderella"" name has many translations too and Grimm's version was quite dark and exaggerated where birds pecked the eyes(of course there's blood) of Cinderella's stepsisters during her wedding and they both died.

Beauty and The Beast I think is the BEST. Both in literature and in movies. I like how ""true love conquers everything"" concept brought to life in a very romantic way, perhaps it is TRUE LOVE, after all... Imagine a pretty young lady falling in love with a cruel beast?

It was a story about not judging others based on what you see-  Belle looked at the cruel beast's kind side instead of looking at his grotesque physical features and ugliness. 

It was a story about bravery- how Belle or Beauty sacrificed herself to the beast, in replacement for her father's imprisonment and even death. Belle wasn't afraid of the beast too.

It was a story about hope- the beast fell into despair but didn't give up his hope from finding someone to love despite his ugly physical appearance, thanks to his castle attendees and butlers.

It was a story about learning your own lesson- the beast was once a handsome prince, but fell into a spell after the enchantress cursed him for being such a rude, disrespectful, cruel, judgemental, unkind and selfish person. But he changed himself for the sake of good. And he learned all the good traits that he lack from Belle. 

And, it was a story about Love- Beast almost gave up his life to save Belle from the wolves(in the movie), he also set Belle free from imprisonment because he knows where Belle can find true happiness even though he loves her and knows that she was the key to break the spell. Belle, loved him back despite his ugliness, because she found love in his heart. They had romantic feelings for each other after all.",2014-12-29T20:07:08.000Z,0

No they were captured and sent here as slaves, so think twice, idiots before you comment racist shit like that, I agree with how Disney's attempt to just throw the black guy in to show they're not racist, because people today are more superstitious about races, like Ferguson is an example. but i don't agree with some people commenting down here some downright rude and you guys are raging about a fairytale? haha what a bunch of pathetic losers you guys all are, wasting your time when you could've found a new hobby to do than bitch about a *movie that you're not forced to watch.* you can go find another movie that you like very easily.

What amazes me that even in this world of fast, instant information,  people feel the rushed need to express they're ugly, vile, beyond racist, and completely ignorant opinions without even looking up or researching other Cinderella movie/stage versions with the click of a button.   This tells me most of you writing negative comments, and even getting so politically upset over that old racial diversity issue...must be under the age of 18. Or just bored and looking to write cuss words on the internet .  Because if you would take a minute to educate yourself,  type in ""Whitney Houston & Brandy  Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1997).  Do the Math Kids!  This made for TV version is a Broadway style musical (Purchased and presented by, yes, the so-called-raciest Walt Disney Productions)..18 years ago in an attempted to make the most culturally neutral, and racially mixed cast in the history of this genre.  This fantastic production was probably before some of you bubble heads were born! LOL!  Take a look people...it has been done. (at that time)  In a  grand and lavish way.  I actually was amused and love the music sung by Brandy and Whitney Houston. And the Country (USA), overall seemed to think this ways so innovative to have thought to have all the characters of different races playing the parts.  However..looking at it now,  this little novelty gets distracting when you see Whoopi Goldberg as the queen with her not so black son, and very white guy husband the King.

Bottom line is, This upcoming reboot looks artistically beautiful.  I love it when Disney spends the money to get every detail more magical than the last.  Disney at its best,  takes visual art to a classic level of excellence.   As an African American man I will be happy to take my little girls to see this Euro version. So lighten up everybody..it's just a Fairy Tale..if you do not like this new anglo version..don't go.  Cinderella is the SUPERMAN of all Euro fairy-tails. I'M NOT MAD AT DISNEY AT ALL! There are countless versions of her story reflected in many different cultures around the world.  All We need to do is stop trying to ""fix Everything"" while forgetting to have fun, relax and enjoy what looks like a beautiful film.  

I'm so sick of political correctness when it comes to Artistic expression and I welcome this All-White, Euro Cast. LOL!  And I  encourage  all of you YouTube  haters, please shut up..or put up.!  Or better yet..make your own damn movie/animated version of Cinderella based on your own culture and artistic choices. 

Oh yeah, and those of you who thinks its stupid or impossible to have a Black Cinderella...in ""our racially divided and hateful America"".... type in (Keke Palmer stars as the first African American actress to play the role of Cinderella on Broadway, 2014 ""In My Own Little Corner."" Rodgers + Hammerstein's CINDERELLA) .....with a White Guy as her Prince!  OMG!


Anyway I made my point.  But isn't silly, the present generation thinks everything started when they came into the world.  Please people,  before you start venting your negative, and foul mouth trash, know something about what the hell you're talking about.

If its all about having Americans rave about the sound of European accents like its still so god damn exotic. The prince had absolutely NO REGAL BEARING, they might as well cast one of the Jonas Brothers to play the charming prince. Kate Blanchette was hired to sell this movie to the intelligent gay market. The idea of Cate playing the stepmother was almost as gay as the sound of ""Angelina Jolie is Lady Maleficent"". But Cate's talent was sadly wasted in a movie merely intended to sell MERCHANDIZE.

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"As a lifelong Disney fan ever since I was a little kid, all I can say after seeing this first real trailer of Disney's newest live-action remake of another of their animated classics is simply wow :)

The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland & Maleficent were all fantastic live-action remakes of Disney animated masterpieces but Cinderella definitely looks to be totally way more faithful to the spirit, essence & the original story of its beloved animated predecessor than the former 3. It really appears as if the phenomenally-gifted Kenneth Branagh has found the always-rare to find perfect balance of staying true to the original while adding new fresh bits & pieces here & there to make this familiar tale feel brand new. Plus the cast he's assembled is just hands down 100% top notch: Downton Abbey co-stars Lily James (Lady Rose) & Sophie McShera (Daisy) as Cinderella & Drizella respectively, Game of Thrones' Richard Madden (The late great Robb Stark) as Prince Charming, Cate Blanchett as The Wicked Stepmother, Helena Bonham Carter as The Fairy Godmother, Sir Derek Jacobi (Gladiator) as The King, Stellan Skarsgard (Thor 1 & 2) as The Grand Duke, Hayley Atwell (The First Avenger: Captain America) as Cinderella's mother & Holiday Grainger (Great Expectations) as Anastasia and as always Kenneth is once again bringing along his go-to composer, the equally-phenomenal Patrick Doyle to score the film. I mean wow :)

The only 2 things that slightly bother me a bit is (1). Hayley as a blonde. Hayley as a blonde is nowhere near as beautiful & attractive as she truly is with her natural brunette hair. They shouldn't have had her dye her beautiful brown hair cause she's way more dreamy as a brunette than as a blonde!!! & (2). I was really hoping that just like in the 2 direct to DVD sequels to the original animated classic that Holiday's Anastasia would be portrayed as a more sympathetic stepsister to Cinderella compared to full-out nasty Drizella & their vicious mother. Anastasia's character evolution from wicked stepsister to misunderstood & surprisingly likable new version of herself as seen in the aforementioned D2DVD sequels was the only thing I loved about those 2 movies!!! Just like in the wonderful Ever After: A Cinderella Story, it was totally refreshing to see at least 1 of Cinderella's stepsisters geniunely care about her like a true sister should so it's a shame that Branagh has seemingly opted to portray Anastasia in her old original full-wicked self. Ah well :(

Aside from those 2 minor hiccups, I simply cannot wait to finally see this next year!!! This is gonna hopefully be an instant Disney classic in every way just like the timeless original :)",2014-12-09T00:16:51.000Z,0

I get that, but this isn't a history lesson movie.. its a movie for children. my child isn't going to be like well hey mom isn't this a movie in the whatever era and say say there a black guy there.. that's just an excuse for them not to be in the movie.. also theres been tons of cases where white people have played other races in movies.. when they played as natives in old cowboy movies.. or like to say Cleopatra is a white lady when shes clearly black and not white.. So how can white people do it but no one else can. im not trying to start a race war just stating my opinion and im black and white. I love both.. but seriously something needs to change.. and to some of the white people getting offended chillax ur not the movie producer u shouldn't be getting so upset u cant do anything about it anyway lol ..",2014-12-07T05:10:36.000Z,0

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"The people who complain that this is an all white cast unknowingly generate racism because their complaints beg the point - what is stopping black people from creating their own stories and characters? Nobody is stopping them. At the end of the day black people are a minority in the US, it only stands to reason that they wouldn't make up an equal proportion of the cast. While the film is a fantasy, it is loosely set in an age and place which was almost solely compromised of white people. The fact it's a fantasy means they don't need to be strict with that representation, but does it actually matter? Seems like an asinine thing to have a teary about. Would you have preferred the director to have been forced to cast a black cinderella, even if it was against his vision as an artist?

Don't take me the wrong way. I would be happy if it was an all black cast and would have about the same level of interest in the film (see: none. I'm male.), I just don't see why racial representation matters. I don't think black people are demeaned simply because they aren't included, nor do I believe they would suddenly be empowered for being represented.

If you worry about the skin colours of characters in a fantasy film, I'd suggest you have it pretty easy in life. People with genuine struggles don't fret over such things.

I mean, in the story and animation Cinderella is presented with sweet and delicate features while as in the live action she has a much more defined structure, something you see in some models of the 21st Century. (That brow game though, it is strong in this one!)
I don't think I have anything bad to say about this because at the end of the day, it's just someone's perspective on the fairy tale and what they want to see in it so I'm not going to hate, it might not be what I want to see but I'm still going to love it because it's someone's hard work and the most important thing, IT'S A DISNEY FILM!! <3 :3 Since I am a Disney fan, I shall love their work until I die.

Seriously though, why is the world, or internet at least, going to shit over all this Race crap lately? The worlds working towards equality the best it can. It's still got its problems but just be happy that it's not hundreds of years ago, where equality would not even be a thing.

Deseoso de mantener a su padre amoroso, Ella da la bienvenida a su nueva madrastra (Cate Blanchett) y sus hijas Anastasia (Holliday Grainger) y Drisella (Sophie McShera) en la casa de la familia. Pero, cuando el padre de Ella inesperadamente muere, ella se encuentra a merced de una nueva familia celosa y cruel.

Finalmente la joven queda relegada a nada más que una sirvienta cubierta de cenizas, y por eso la llaman Cenicienta. Ella podría comenzar a perder la esperanza. Sin embargo, a pesar de la crueldad, Ella está decidida a honrar a las últimas palabras de su madre: ""tener coraje y ser amable."" Ella no va a ceder a la desesperación ni el desprecio a los que la maltratan. Y luego conoce a extraño en el bosque. Sin darse cuenta de que él es en realidad un príncipe, no simplemente un aprendiz en el Palacio como parece, Ella finalmente siente que ha conocido a su alma gemela. Al parecer, su fortuna pueden estar a punto de cambiar cuando el Palacio envía una invitación abierta a todas las doncellas para asistir a un baile, aumentando las esperanzas de Ella de encontrarse nuevamente con el encantador desconocido (Richard Madden). Por desgracia, su madrastra le prohíbe a asistir y cruelmente destroza su vestido. Pero, como en todos los buenos cuentos de hadas, la ayuda está a la mano, y una mendiga amablemente (Helena Bonham Carter) se adelanta y - con una calabaza y unos ratones - cambia la vida de Cenicienta para siempre.

And don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of HBC, but I'm only saying that there is always room for representation, if you really care to have it, without it being a fucking maid standing in a corner.

PS: In this trailer, the evil stepmother and her two daughters show up wearing really heavy make up, something that was totally not a thing in the late 18th century, women, especially upper class ladies, would never be caught dead with a full face of make up on. It was only wore by actresses and whores. And that is just a single bit of all the historical inaccuracy featured in this film (don't even get me started on the hairstyles) but oHH NO GOD FORBID PEOPLE OF COLOR IN A 2015 MOVIE ADAPTION OF AN EUROPEAN TALE!!!

In the other hand, I find it pretty ridiculous and even offensive to try to force in a movie all races of the world just to make people feel ""represented"". It would be dumb to have a movie about the US civil war with a bunch of ethnically diverse patriots fighting for the freedom of the ethnically diverse slaves.
As it would be ridiculous to have a movie about ancient india with white and black people as the lead characters.

As it is ridiculous to expect ethnically diverse people in a movie set up in the rennaisance, like Cinderella is! There weren't a majority of Indians nor east Asians (and for sure not latin Americans) in Europe back then, and they would definitely not be the aristocracy or royality.

I see where people come from complaining about how Cinderella simply wished and didn't do anything to actively rescue herself except be pretty enough to catch the eye of someone who could do something (a common theme in Grimm fairy tales), but it was fabricated during a time where much wasn't expected of women, and wasn't necessarily the Grimm Brothers' doing at that.  Remember, their job was to go around and listen to fables given via word of mouth and document it.  While they may have edited them some based on their own views, most probably stayed the same as they were told previously.  It's why I like stories like Bluebeard and The Little Mermaid.  Sure, in the original the mermaid dies at the end, but she did her best and sacrificed herself for her love (one-sided as it was), and Bluebeard's wife didn't just accept her fate and fought back when she was to be murdered, ending up victorious, so one can't say all Grimm stories are the same.  I suppose those versions wouldn't really suit Disney's target audience, though.  I enjoyed Cinderella 3: A Twist in Time (once that terribly tacky opening sequence was over) because Cinderella had to actively do things to regain her happy ending, and she looked amazing doing it.  Sorry, I have this issue where I go off on tangents.  Anyway.

My problem with this new film is that, at least in the trailer, save for the preemptive meeting with the prince on horseback and the flashback scenes with the mother, all of the scenes are from Disney's cartoon.  It's just a live action version of something they've already done over half a century ago.  I suppose the story of Cinderella has been twisted just as often as Snow White, and the fairy tale universe itself (i.e., Once Upon A Time, Fables/The Wolf Among Us, The 10th Kingdom, Into the Woods, etc.), but do we ever really get tired of it?  I hope this version will have some sort of little twist at the end.  Just her managing to get out of the locked room by herself would be enough for me, instead of having to rely on friendly rodents.  Really, who would pay to go to a theater, only to watch something they've seen before?  Well, it's Cinderella, so a lot of people will, but I think I'll just stay home that day and watch the original instead while waiting for this to hit Redbox or NetFlix, at least until I hear something about this version that makes me believe it's worth the expense.",2014-12-03T11:54:18.000Z,0

Here we go, having a comment that has actually something to do with the trailer.
There are fairies, mice turning to horses, comfortable glass shoes, pumpkin carriage and Stark coming back to life with shiny blue eyes, and yet some people think the only unrealistic thing is the lack of ethnic variability.
Also, I think Cate Blanchett will be the only evil step-mother I will ever like.

The saddest part is that they themselves don't even realize they simultaneously profess contradictory thoughts.    That being said, let me as some questions, so I may better understand your arguments.
     Is it that the movie studio would not hire an individual of African heritage (easier to just say black...even though all Homo sapiens evolved into our present form on the African continent over several million years and only hundred fifty thousand years ago did we begin migrate to other continents.  I say this because me are much more alike than we are similar.  With a little genetic research you will find the hidden secret of racism they hide...THERE IS NOT BIOLOGICAL Foundation for RACE.  Human races are not natural genetic groups; they are socially constructed categories.  I've just glossed over a very complicated yet well documented SCIENTIFIC FACT so don't consider this a complete defense.  Now I'm getting back to my questions after a very long parentheses!)
     Was it the director who choose not to cast a black ( feels so weird using that word) or was it the writers?  Or are you claiming that society has unconsciously (or ON PURPOSE) fostered and cultivated an atmosphere wherein black characters are segregated to all black movies?  My point us obvious...WHO OR WHOM DO YOU BELIEVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LACK OF MINORITY INCLUSION in archetypal character roles traced back to European fables?   If my assumption is correct then I predict all those criticizing this modern Cinderella movie attribute different causes to the cinematic racial segregation of actors/characters from classic European fairy tales.",2014-12-02T10:51:07.000Z,1

I like movies that don't care about color or looks, just real normal people. But these only white super hot looking actors in movies gets boring.

I know this is just a trailer, so there may be some new twists in the actual film, but the storyline looks very ""passive girl allows everyone to walk all over her, then is rewarding for her doormat ways with a happy ending she did nothing to work for or earn"". The original film was a historically remarkable classic, and steering your children in a less damaging interpretation of the tale isn't that difficult, but how ""modern"" is this retelling really going to be? I'll watch it because I like fluffy fairy-tale films, but it's time we moved on from outdated story tropes.",2014-11-28T20:18:53.000Z,5

It came out in 1997 and it starred Brandy Norwood as Cinderella, Filipino-American actor Paolo Montalban as the Prince and even had Whoopi Goldberg in it. For me it was the only live-action Cinderella out there growing up.

I think it makes some sense that if Disney is doing a live-action reboot of Cinderella as a feature film, they're going to base the ethnic palate be a bit closer to the animated version of Cinderella from the 1950's or on the original French story.",2014-11-27T13:06:24.000Z,0

Racism doesn't just apply to black people it can also happen to white people and any other race.

Forgive us (white people), that we do see you as real people and therefore we fully embrace a whole black Annie movie, and we fully embrace a percentage of black Oscar winners that is actually higher than the actual percentage of black people in the population. Because it's about talent, not color. So no need for ""black reel awards"" and shitty comments on a Cinderella film please. Get over yourself and start seeing yourself as people too.

On the subject of racial representation, I think anyone who sees diversity as a negative is racist, but I respect and uphold every artist's right to tell the story they want to tell. Historically, Europe was predominantly white but not entirely so - diversity was definitely a thing (ever heard of the Moors? The Romani?). Given the expense of traveling, I have to conclude that the only non-white people who would've frequented Europe would have been wealthy if not royal or noble personages. Also, I wonder how many people in this comment section would pay to see a movie based on an African or Asian fairy tale.",2014-11-26T12:19:48.000Z,0

You know, most kids are actually exposed to NAKED breasts from when they're just born, (the actual function of having a pair of tits is so that you can feed babies) so well... in my opinion the boobs do no harm.

And also, I am not sure about this, but I think that at the time and place that this story seems to have taken place, most women wore corsets that pushed the boobs even higher up then in this movie. But you know, I could be mistaking it for some other time.

Anyway, her dress does not seem to be following any strict code for a certain fashion era, but I belive it's completely suitable for our time because at least here in Sweden most of us seem comfortable with women showing a little bit of their chest.

It was made in the 50's! The characters were all white...that is what they based it off....the black people already had an all black cast back in 97 for Cinderella...i don't see anything wrong with an all white cast for a remake of a cartoon with all white people.

Cause the real problem with this movie isn't the all white as fuck casting but the British as fuck thing. CINDERELLA IS FRENCH ! IT'S PART OF FRANCE SOCIAL HISTORY ! This story was told since the Middle Age in France for talking about it doesn't matter if you came from the worst situation (bastard in the old days and it was normal to threat bastards like shit before) with work and faith (because Cinderella doesn't really show kindness but mostly faith in God and try to be the nicest person in His name) you can reach the top. It told a lot about the history of this country, their norms and how people weren't maybe that useless and stupid before but now ... English ? Damn ! Even in the first version of Disney the voice had FRENCH ACCENTS GODAMMIT ! What are you trying to do Disney huh ? After centuries England and France are finally at peace but you're trying to do what her by giving on of the most important fairytale in France to the British ? Start the 100 years war again ?

What I do like about this movie is that we get to see Cinderella's birth mother have more of an influence on her life. Not just her father. It also looks like she won't be randomly falling in love with the prince after meeting him only once. Maybe they'll go the Ever After route and make Cinderella and the prince meet a couple of times to develop a relationship before the ball.

The preview doesn't look that bad but I doubt the movie will ever be good as Cinderella (1997) or Ever After.",2014-11-25T15:57:26.000Z,0

They have no money left from buying Star Wars and Marvel, so they are just going to remake every animated film from the past. Maleficent was the first piece of shit. Right now it's Cinderella and in ten years, Frozen will be remade and after that The Avengers and after that Cinderella will get remade again. They have billions of dollars to make up for their greed and if you submit your children to this garbage, you will be re-feeding the beast.

Don't see this movie. Just watch the original if you love the story and go pay to see something original, not another money grab from a studio that hasn't made anything decent since the 1940s.

I am happy for her to finally have that scene, at least once, in her weird sombre career. -------------- 2. Sadly they make every nationality British accented in period films, every single one. Cause Anglo sounds ""smart & clean"" & every other accent sounds ""dumb & dirty"" or they will only use French Accents to emphasize a Sleazy & Easy Person. Arggh. ------------ 3. No one wants to see saggy-titted-squatted-over-a-forest-loohole women in ballgowns. I.E. Aretha Franklin & her (literal) Flop Frock.] -------------- 4. They are ripping off ""Ever After"" with the meeting her before hand, while she is having a moment of independent rebellion, But at the same time, its better than the cartoon, where they just LOVE each other, cause they are so pretty & shy. *barf*  ----------- 5. So her Dad doesnt die? well its wrong, BUT The fact that she gets to know her MOTHER at all? Bothers me more, Step-Mother!!  ------- 6.France had been importing Black Africans for Centuries & keeping them as Pets in Luxury, much like a Paris Hilton Dog. so....they'd be there, in France. (Hey its better then that time they tried to pass off a spoiled Beverly Hills New-Money Black girl with 5000$ weave off as the Cindergirl.) I just really hope there are no Orientals in this, unless they are Siamese Envoys crawling to the throne in admiration!.

The cast also featured an Asian prince (son of an African-American queen and Caucasian king), a Caucasian step-mother, one Caucasian step-sister, and one African-American step-sister. If you want diversity, watch that and stop bitching about this movie featuring a mostly Caucasian cast.

So...we have Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, Mulan, Lion King(photorealistic CG obviously), The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Rescuers, Lilo & Stitch(You think they wouldn't?), The Black Cauldron and Hercules for the remainder of the recognized Animated Disney Movies that are likely to get a Live action counterpart.  Did I forget Tarzan?  Probably forgot Tarzan...

My bet is that Mulan will be next, simply because it's more action oriented than any of the others and female lead with love as a sub-plot.  My list goes like this of ones to release in order.

Mulan
The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Pocahontas
Little Mermaid
Lilo & Stitch
The Black Cauldron
Aladdin
Hercules
The Rescuers
Lion King(least likely to also get made at all)

I don't need a black superman, I don't need a Spanish Snow white either! What would be nice is races with their own fairy tale. Also, don't try to make it different just because the person is Indian or something. Make a unique story and use different races. There's no need to take the same story and make twists and turns so it sounds more like what a black person would go through. If you want to make a story that takes place in another country, then do it!show off that country and make us interested in the culture! Don't try to conform to ""making everybody happy"" No body wants to go home with a group of friends and ask  ""do you want to watch the African, Scottish or Asian Cinderella?"" All cultures want to have their own fairy tales and heroes in their own right in relation to their culture. Just like Japan has samurai and Europeans have knights. I understand wanting to see people in movies that relate to your culture more but would you rather have a fairy tale that has been colored to look like you or something original that has meaning to where you came from?

Guess what? It is because the film is based of a story, written and set by Europeans, at a time in Europe where it was mostly white people. Please read through my comment and you might understand why that is actually a very valid argument and why it actually promotes diversity.
First of all, I am not even white, but I have to point out that trying to force PoC in this is a form of cultural appropriation. Believe me, I hate white supremacists more than any group of people, and due to bad experiences, I have a certain disliking to white people in general, but to me, blacks or asians trying to get in on Classical European literature works, is a form of them submitting to white supremacy, that white culture is superior then there own culture. I stand for diversity, and a form of multiculturalism very few understand. To me, I would rather see 5 disney movies, with each movie being an adaptation of a literary classical or folklore story that belongs to a certain culture, with all the characters being cast of that ethnicity, not see 5 movies with all races mixed together. I would rather see an Arabian Nights adaptation, with an all-Arab or Persian cast, and a Chinese folklore adaptation with an all Chinese cast, and an Indian legend adaptation with an all Indian/Pakistani cast, and a African folklore adaptation with an all Black cast, and a Western-European classic adaptation with an all white cast. When keeping all these different stories to their own ethnic casts, you are actually preserving each and every culture's heritage. When you mix the cast for adaptations of each of these stories, you are destroying them. I would be equally pissed to see a white guy in Mulan or Aladdin, as I would be to see a black person in Cinderella.",2014-11-22T15:22:51.000Z,1

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"Wow, for all its flaws, I was still kinda hoping this would turn out to be more like Maleficent. Maleficent wasn't particularly well made, but it had elements to draw you in; it had Angelina Jolie looking exactly like the classic villain, it had a gritty origin story that completely re-wrote the tale and gave new dimension to the character, and it had a great twist ending that made it all worth it despite the flaws. I want to hold out hope that MAYBE the ""kindness"" thing they keep repeating is going to have a similar angle, like maybe the stepmother and stepsisters are secretly jealous of Cindy because they thought her dad loved her and her mom more but Cindy's unwavering kindness will turn them around at the end and they'll be like a real family or something, but that's definitely not the vibe I'm getting from the trailer. I'm also not a fan of the costuming, Cindy's dress looks nothing like the original and it doesn't look period appropriate either and Lady Tremaine also doesn't appear to look or act anything like the classic villain, and between her and the fairy godmother looking way too fabulous and not at all like the original middle-aged matriarchs it feels like the movie is going to be all style and no substance. All in all, it looks like it's going to be JUST the same story but with some extra scenes of Cindy and her parents and the prince and nothing new or exciting or nostalgic to actually draw in a crowd like Maleficent.",2014-11-21T23:30:04.000Z,2

It reminds me too much of Christian Grey in the 50 Shades of Grey trailer, the tone is too measured and slow. Many people are complaining about how women are stereotyped into being weak and helpless (which they too often are) but have you considered the equal and opposite stereotyping of men? The men designed to cater to female fancy must be brave, strong, reliable, forward to the point where it would be uncomfortable if they weren't found attractive - this is exactly what the male lead reflects. And I get the feeling it's becoming worse - though I haven't seen the original in ages, I remember the original Prince Charming was less determinedly masculine (IN A GOOD WAY - there is nothing more beautiful than a good romantic duet :) ).

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"I hope everyone realises that these movies are mostly made for the 90's kids who grew up on Disney and are now in their 20's. So they make them real life, remove the singing, add in some 'edgy' new angles and then sell it to all of those who still need their Disney fix, but want a more 'grown up' tone. On a side note, if you're going to make your characters blonde (which is adhering to the traditional cinderella so that's fine) and you're not going to cast actresses that are naturally blonde (again, fine if you're looking for acting talent rather than model cast and hope for the best), you at least need to talk to your make up department and make sure that their eyebrows match their hair. I know it's a small detail, but I don't usually notice these things, and this time I noticed. But oh well, maybe it's a trick to make their faces easier to express. ",2014-11-21T12:14:03.000Z,0

Not every film needs a princess going through what seems to be an acid trip if it was written by Alice Cooper, not every film needs villains to be needlessly turned into tragic heroes, not every remake needs to have violence, dark themes, total changes or have PG-13 rating. This looks all right, and it looks like it keeps the spirit of Cinderella but also gives it some new stuff. Once it's out, go watch it and then hate it on it or whatever.

Stick to that, Maleficent was garbage, Angelina Jolie was the only reason to watch that movie. If they want live action bring back Howard The Duck! ",2014-11-21T06:47:41.000Z,2

Does it automatically make it racist? No. I realise that it may come across as that but I highly doubt that's the case. I've seen the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical version of Cinderella with a Black Cinderella, a white step family, the prince is Asian and the queen is black and king is white yet it today still remains one of my FAVOURITE films. The race does not make a film. The acting does. You could have a mixed race cast but if the acting isn't good it's not going to be a good film. The same goes for an all white cast, if the acting is rubbish then likely the films not going to be much better.  For all we know the actors or actresses could be mixed race but still look white. I realise that racism is a major issue and I think it's awful but not everything is an attack on race.I get peoples point about this being story of Northern European origins and at the time that it was written, the idea of a black or any other race person being wealthy or being of high standing was not realistic and I still find it appalling how anyone of a different race was treated but it was reality though it does not make it right. Does this mean that a new take can't be done? No. This is a traditional take on the story and casting and so I think people need to understand that. If there was racism going on behind the casting choice (not casting another race because of personal prejudice) then that's a real shame. I think this film looks good and I'll be interested in seeing how well it does.",2014-11-21T02:07:22.000Z,2

What’s the significance of the mice turning into horses?
What’s the significance of the fairy?
What’s the significance of the glass shoes?  Is it bad that some lady got hold of one of them? 
What’s the significance of that party the girl is attending?  ( By the way, who is that girl? )
Who is the guy she is dancing with?  Is he a gardener?  a soldier? a cook? a garbage man?  Why is he relevant?
Why is she spending all her time with that guy?  It's a party.  Why doesn't she spread herself around more?

Also, Prince Charming's smile at 0:56 is hilarious and he reminds me of Michael Shannon if his eyes weren't wide out open all the time. Again, that's just me. Also, Rogers and Hammerstein had the right idea when they did Cinderella be a black woman and other characters be a different race that isn't white.

And yes, back then, in those times of which they are set and the first published story of Cinderella was in 1634 where woman depending on men was something that ACTUALLY happened and even then if you go back further the story seemed to originate in Ancient Greek times which, once again, woman stayed at home, dependent on what the husband can earn and she cooked and cleaned. So yes, woman are dependent on men in these stories and now times have changed but given Anderson and Grimm (most well known) wrote these stories in the 17 or 1800's or whatever it is woman were STILL dependent on men then as well so the men wrote from what they knew and in those times woman didn't have jobs, went out, had meals at fancy restaurants by themselves etc because it would of been wrong for a woman to exercise her independence.

So yes we have moves based on the ORIGINAL works because if you have seen the modern fairy tales that have been made they are all crap, as long as you teach the little girls that they can be independent on their own then let them have the fantasy of finding a prince and living a non stressful life because as soon as they grow up they realize they won't be having that and they need to make it on their own. I grew up with these stories and as a 31 year old woman I didn't throw a tantrum because I didn't get my prince and castle, these stories never scarred me so let the little girls have their fantasies, it is HEALTHY for them to pretend they may get a prince, it is called having an imagination and besides, one or two MIGHT get a prince, look at Kate, I doubt she grew up thinking 'oh one day I am going to marry William!' when she was 12+ (age to more or less start to let go of these fantasies and realizing that, ya know, princes are not for everyone) for her, she was just lucky that she actually WAS able to nab herself a prince.",2014-11-20T21:59:04.000Z,4

This story is set in a time and place were multiculturalism wasn't much of a thing, which sucked and everything, but my lord can we just accept that there is actual historical reasoning behind why they cast white people into the main roles? It's not racism, it's realistic, which  maybe isn't the entire point of Cinderella, but it's the way the story was originally meant to be portrayed. It says nothing of a ""white washed"" America or whatever the heck else people want to call it. What if someone decided to tell the story of Mulan and replaced the characters with white people? It wouldn't make sense, and it would be stupid to try and shove a culture into another one where they weren't present. Maybe if they had retold Cinderella in a setting that would make sense with another culture it would be cool, or something like that, but hating on Disney for sticking to the original story is just a waste of energy and, frankly, kind of ignorant.

For starters this is not a musical everyone like the animated version so you won't be hearing A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes , Bibbidi Bobidi Boo etc. Jaq and Gus won't be in this or wear clothes like in the original , so ever since I heard that Disney was doing this I was dissapointed because people are going to confuse it with the animated one. Also notice that they are all British in the Walt Disney animated one they all had American accents , also the stepmother here has red hair in the animated one she had grey hair , yes her name is Lady Treamine like in the cartoon, yes Anastasia and Drizella are the names of the stepsisters etc. yes Cinderella is blonde and has a blue dress , but don't let Disney fool you all guys this is not a direct REMAKE OF THE CARTOON ONE WE ALL KNOW ITS NOT A MUSICAL ETC.

Secondly, this is a FUCKING FAIRYTALE,  yes it may be based on European history or whatever, but at the end of the day it's a FAIRYTALE. Thirdly, everybody calm your fucking tits, woah there's a black guy, big fucking deal. The whole point of acting is to be chosen for a part based on your ability, not your fucking race. I'm sure that Nonso Anozie, yes that's his name, was chosen by his portrayal of a character by the director, not because of his race. People are chosen on their ability as actors, NOT because of their race. NOBODY in a FAIRYTALE has to be of any particular colour or race, it's not like it's a film about slaves or the KKK or some shit, so calm the fuck down and leave it.

Firstly, it is a fantasy movie with mice turning into horses and a pumpkin into a carriage. If you can suspend belief over those points, the ethnic make-up of the cast shouldn't trouble you at all. Secondly, there were people of non-European, non-white descent in Europe in the early modern period (and in other periods too). This was particularly the case at court where having a black or brown servant was desirable. For example, the 19th-century Russian poet Pushkin was part African, as his grandfather (or great-grandfather... I can't remember which) had been a slave brought to Russia by a wealthy merchant in the early 18th century.",2014-11-20T19:34:12.000Z,0

More diversity, in the movies you make Disney. I get it it's a classic, but classics have been re imagined all the time. I truly believe that the animated magic that spawned the lion king, lilo and stitch and snow white, can create a more diverse body of work, than just showing Cinderella over and over again. Just look into the myths and legends all over the world, there are so many inspirations/stories to tell, than just the Euro-centric image you have portrayed.

I especially hated the very concept of Maleficent. These fairy tales were created to teach children lessons. They were stories about right and wrong. Now these movies either skip the lesson entirely, or turn it on its head. So often they teach bad lessons or attempt to my the villain a hero. It makes me sick, and that is coming from someone who read the original, gruesome versions of the stories.

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"In my opinion it looks the same as everything done before. The trailer is edited to make it seem epic with loud music, but it looks quite normal. This story is overused and getting tired. If you are going to do something again do it right. You don't have to make it action packed or change the story like Snow White and the Huntsman or Mirror Mirror. But like those movies you should take something over done and make it more interesting in costume, casting, and location, etc. My favrouite retelling of this story is Ever After: A Cinderella Story. it's simple but really alluring.

About the race dispute in the comment section,
You're looking for ""Cinderella"" staring Brandy. It's also disney and has almost every race. In fact it's here on Youtube if you search it. Just watch that. It's a bit more musical but it's not that different than something like this. I like that one a lot.",2014-11-20T18:32:29.000Z,2

They feel as if non white people are to be put here and there so that they dont feel racist, but feeling as if non white people are a minority to honour IS a genuine racism in itself. No one wonders why Bolywood movies dont imply white/asian/black... people. And why is that? Because countries that are mainly white are the only one to have so much minorities! So the blame is on demography, as stupid as it sounds. Racism lies in the categorization itself in this debate..",2014-11-20T17:13:54.000Z,0

I for one loved the trailer and is a big fan of Disney even though the majority of it is white. What do you expect? The tale of Cinderella came from a European country not from an Africa which is a continent. If we as Black people want our own story then we should make one and not complain about it because most of the tales are European based that's produced from other companies such as Disney.

Like Cinderella both embody the struggle against oppression by society and rotten culture. The story of Ye Xian is more honest and beautiful than Cinderella, in my opinion. Plus, the role of fairy godmother is fulfilled by a talking fish (sent by the girl's mother from the afterlife)! :D 

If fairies are mandatory for Ye Xian to be made, they could very easily add carbuncles (rock-fairies) to the plot (they fit the setting of cave-dwellers). Although the guardian spirit (the talking fish) makes it more unique.﻿",2014-11-20T15:23:07.000Z,58

So why in the hell would come PC dumb stoopid ass think the movie should have other races? Dumb ass fuck! There was no such thing as multi culuralism in this century! Stop trying to force black dick up white coochies! Of course the feminazis is gonna hate too cause it dont have that man hating shit in it! If the movie is white so the hell what! it's in early Europe! Helena looks GORGEOUS too! Isnt this based on a true story minus the fairy god mother? Cinderella lost her dad at 8 and was taken cared of by her wicked step mother and married to the Prince at 18??? Can't wait to see it!,2014-11-20T15:10:47.000Z,200

I just have one question: Is this going to be a musical or are the mice going to talk? Because the one thing the live action 101 Dalmatians did well was not making the animals talk (as well as the stellar casting of Glenn Close as Cruella).

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"i am a black girl, and in all honesty i cant see cinderella being black. Why? because of the historical inaccuracy. This story i'm guessing is set in england i presume, maybe during slavery, i'm not sure. How would that work? Cinderella's father would have had to be a rich black man, which i'm not sure was possible, before he left or died ( i'm not sure which style they're going to use) and probs married a black stepmother. Fine. What about the prince though, I doubt they can use a caucasian male to dance with the african female, and then marry her in the end. If they did, then the whole movie might be about the father not wanting an african princess, or the country not accepting her.Thus, its not even cinderella at all. It's another story entirely. Maybe if they changed the whole dynamic and made it a dystopian society then maybe it would work. But until that happens, let the european stories remain how they were written. Instead, let's make our own fairytales. Keep it in mind, these were stories written a while ago to adhere to society during those times. They can't just  change an important part of the lead character. New stories are being thought of every day.

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"This actually looks pretty good! It's surprisingly close to the original Cinderella (well, the cartoon one, at least), and the cast is new and refreshing as they are not all uber famous actors. Some people are complaining about the lack of racial diversity, but I am a woman of color myself, and I find no problem with it in this movie at least. It's historically accurate (I'm actually glad there aren't tons of black people in this movie. As accurate as Disney likes to be, they all would have had to be depicted as slaves or servants, and as horrible as that is, it's what people of color would have been in that era. I think we can all agree that has no place in this movie. Besides, it's a fairytale. Your kid doesn't give a shit what color skin the princess has, as long as she-or he- gets to wear a tiara just like hers). Just as movies like Mulan, Princess and the Frog, Aladdin, and Frozen were, the peoples' races are just as they would have been in that country and time period. That's some ace research and historical representation on Disney's part if I may say so. The only person who could have been more racially diverse is the Fairy Godmother, and that's my only complaint. She should have been something other than white, as she's a fairy, not a born and bred European. That was a wasted chance, imo. Otherwise though, I'm excited to see this! It looks really well-done, and I hope it turns out as awesome as it's presented to be! Though I must agree they showed WAY too much in this trailer... -__-
 And if you REALLY desire a racially diverse version of Cinderella, go watch Roger and Hammerstein's rendition of Cinderella. It's my favorite, and extremely well done! Cinderella is black, and so is her fairy godmother and the Queen. The Prince is Asian, and even one of the stepsisters is black. I absolutely recommend it, 10/10!",2014-11-20T12:09:50.000Z,0

I've read through a few negative comments, and I think - really? - sometimes we need to just 'chill' some people hit the gym. Some people smoke Weed. Some people do Yoga. Some people meditate.....and some people just live to a absurd themselves in a fantasy for an hour and a half!

She could have her eyebrows tattooed on by the fairy godmother. At least it'd make sense why her family has her cleaning n stuff. Also make the prince black just to piss off the general public with some mexinegro love. Oh and have her be like 14yrs old and 4 months pregnant. Now that would be a great movie.

Based on the trailer, I think that the step mother and step sisters will be even more evil in the live action than the cartoon and there won't be as much comedy with the mice and cat. 
I wonder if this is going to be better than the cartoon or not. Not likely because the Cinderella cartoon movie was a classic old movie like Sleeping Beauty, or even Sword in the Stone, that many young children loved. And I admit that I still kinda like them too.",2014-11-20T11:28:37.000Z,0

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"When I watched it for the first time it legit gave me goosebumps and I ended up watching it more than 5 times in a row hehehe. The plot being the same as the old and classic Disney version was actually what I liked the most about this new one. Yes, we do want to see those stories that have been part of our childhood, magically created in real life with beautiful characters. Disney classic fairy tails are perfect the way they are and because we are so used to them since we were little kids, we consider them as the main version or the 'true' version (even though they aren't). Therefore, the only way to make it 'better' is by using innovative cinematic techniques, NOT by changing or adding new unrelated elements to the story. I actually find it disappointed when they recreate old movies and introduce a whole lot of things just to make it different or ""unseen"". It's as if they were trying to change our childhood memories and the only thing that goes through my mind is: ""No... that's not right! That's not what happened in the story... They're wrong"". It's the same kind of disappointment when we watch a movie based on a book we already read, because the images of our imagination are already in our heads (or in this case, images of our memories) and when people show it in a complete different way is kinda upsetting. Maleficent was different though, because they didn't tell us the same story in a complete different way. They introduced us a background (the truth underlying the classic story) and that's what made it different & good at the same time. Also, another thing that I found remarkably good in Cinderella is the casting chosen, especially Lily James. To play the main character you gotta know how to act as a real-princess (I'm using hyphen here because I'm not saying 'real' as in a ""true princess"", but as in a princess closer to reality). Well.. to explain it better, we don't live in Monarchies anymore so princesses are not part of our daily lives. Therefore, to represent something unreal (a princess) as real as possible, Lily James used nothing else than emotions - universal feelings !! - something we all can relate to :) She didn't have blank faces or fake crystallized tears like Mia Wasikowska in Alice in Wonderland or Elle Fanning in Maleficent. You can easily see her emotions only through her facial expressions, like her reaction when Lady Tremaine tells her to call her Madam, when she meets the prince (in this particularly scene she reminded me of Kate Winslet playing Rose in Titanic by the way *-*), her look of surprise when she touches the white horse, or even before that, when the fairy godmother appears it's possible to see her red face and swallow eyes because she was crying. PLUS she did all that still having the adorable, sweet, gentle and beautiful looks of a true princess. So in summary, Lily James easily portrayed Cinderella as a princess but simultaneously as a real person. I won't even talk about the prince (Richard Madden) but for now, all I'm gonna say is that when he said: ""Believe me they are all looking at you"" WOW! My heart melted. hahaha. In conclusion, I absolutely loved the fact that it followed the original one. I even loved how the colors of her dresses are the same from the old version and how she also uses a cloth on her hair as a maid. I loved all the similarities and even the small differences. And I loved how the dearest Disney princess was portrayed by the gorgeous Lily James :) I'm sooooooo looking forward to watching this movie <3

I wrote it when I realized that black people (look this up, proven at Harvard and Berkeley) are all to fucking stupid to read and write.  In fact, all the black people in Africa (not North Africa, don't start that shit...those are Caucasians you fucking morons) did not even have written languages until Europe and Asia brought theirs.

Sooo, that being said, here is my story......

Once Upon A Time, there is a black skanky bitch named Lowandasquisha and she lived in Detroit. Her mother is on the welfare and also on food stamps.   Lowandasquisha  eats a lot to escape her lonliness (she is ugly and fat....really fat....like how the fuck did you get that fat?????  kind of fat.  She also smells.

One day she eats so much that she crashes through the floor of their apartment and kills 73 people on the way down.   Well, in the ER she meets a nice crack head who tells her ""I am a Prince, and I am rich, but you have to let me fuck your ass every night for a month, then I will be at your service, and assistant if you will.""

So, Lowandasquisha  being desperate, and also an orphan (she killed her mom in the apartment disaster) gives up her big smelly ass to the crack head for 1 month.

After the month, she demands ""OK, you fucked my ass for a month, I want your assistance, you promosed.""

That is when the crack head said, ""Oh, you want me to aid you know?  Well, you might say, you already have it.....because I gave you the AIDS.""

These fantasy stories are based on European history as you can see from their clothes.

But I don't like the choice of Helena for the fairy godmother. Her costume and wig look tacky on her. I know she has played several ""round"" characters, so I guess that was one of the decisions for picking her. 
It's a 'meh' for me but I'm still excited to see it. The graphics look stunning and the clothing looks great too. I love how the glass shoes were kept, the ripping of her mother's dress and the glue ball gown she was given by the fairy godmother",2014-11-20T08:43:54.000Z,0

But i like authenticity more than a good mix. Like seriously all the multicultural movies that been produce has been horrible. Btw the Cinderella story is not just based on the European fairy tales. For example, the Chinese version of Cinderella has been out like a thousand years earlier than the European counterpart. And even though it was first it would still be weird for me to see an all Asian cast on a western movie for Cinderella because your whole life you been taught in school and media that Cinderella is a typical northern Caucasian girl. Same thing like how Jesus was portrayed as a white man but in actuality he would look more middle eastern and wouldn't you feel weird if you seen Jesus looking like a middle eastern even though that's how he originally look like.",2014-11-20T08:43:19.000Z,1

It's SO much better than all those horrible remakes where they hand the princes/heroine a sword and have her kill people and are like ""there. now she's like a male warrior. NOW we can respect her."" I just think Cinderella gets such a bad rap! The concept in valuing truth, patience, kindness and forgiveness above all, even in the face of abuse and bullying is REALLY powerful. It's so much easier to be like ""here, kill the bad guy."" But let's face it, that never happens in real life. This is a much more challenging, yet rewarding message. And as for the fancy gown at the ball- the point is, since this is the Perrault (not German) version of the fairytale, she gets rewarded with the gown from the fairy godmother and with help from the animals, because she is a good person! She gets rewarded with luxury and extravagance, for once, at the ball, because it is supposed to reflect her internal beauty. The idea is that good people, who are strong enough to remain good people, win out in the end. An optimistic lesson, yes, but probably more applicable to the real world, and a nice change from all the villain-obsessed flicks out lately.",2014-11-20T08:07:03.000Z,0

Stop being idiots. The only ones making an issue out of this are the people brining race into the discussion. Also can we please talk about the era this story was written? And if you want a cinderella with people of colour, there are tonnes of versions where they are represented - for example the Brandy and Whoopy Goldberg one. G

2) This is a fairytale. It is not meant to be logical. Fairytales are there to give us hope and by rationalising every aspect of the story you are completely missing the point and hence ruining it for yourself and everyone who wants to enjoy it. Let people dream. Actually, let children dream about finding prince charming and magic because we are allowed to. It is not some crime because people think it makes no sense.

Why does common sense go out the window when a production gets a huge budget? His skin is fine, just clean it and moisturize. If the lenses and lighting are good, he's going to look good. With 35mm and panavision cine glass, you're going to see the makeup and then if you try to blend it in post, you've created a bunch of work that never needed to be done and ended up making a really plastic looking image from $30,000 lenses.

The problem is not that Cinderella is white, it's a Euro-tale so we know she was never created as a black girl. The problem is that Disney is white washed majorly, even when they do more colorful movies. That's the truth and if you don't see it you are ignorant or racist or stuck in a white bubble. They made a great movie with a black princess and dropped it quick. They have never made a truly colorful movie that reflected the culture fully, and they always got their whitewashes in there. Their shows and movies always feature one or two stereotypical blacks, asians, indians, indian(N.A.) or hispanic. Racism is still here and dominant even though people try to act like its not. I love Disney as I have worked for them and been mentored by some of their greatest artist and employees. BUT Disney is a company owned by a racist family, that caters to the dominant mind set of the white washed world. 
Now I'm a black girl who loves whites guys, Johnny Depp and fairy tales and even bad movies, so I will be seeing this with a smile. The only problem I have is that the movie looks a bit boring but hey. ",2014-11-20T06:37:54.000Z,28

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"*sighs heavily after looking at some of the comment threads* why do people have to make such a big deal about whether the cast is diverse or not? It's not going to make much of a difference whether the cast is all Caucasian, African, Latino, Asian, Native American, Hawaiian, Russian, or Indian (you can add more to the list if you'd like); the only thing that's going to be effected is the setting. Disney chose to recreate the European version of Cinderella, so having a 95% Caucasian cast is to be expected. And before anyone says it, I am fully aware that Europe is not all Caucasian, but it is mostly Caucasian. And also, just because the cast is mostly Caucasian, doesn't automatically make the movie bad unless you the viewer decides that it will. 

That being said, while I think the trailer was too revealing, I think the film will be alright over all.",2014-11-20T05:26:28.000Z,1

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"""Cinderella"": In the Brothers Grimm version, one of Cinderella's evil stepsisters cuts off her toes, and the other her heel so they can both fit into the tiny glass slipper. The prince is notified by little doves that there is blood on the shoe, and finally discovers that the true owner is Cinderella. Once the stepsisters realize that they should try to win favor with Cinderella (after all, she will be queen), they attend her wedding, only to have their eyes pecked out by birds

SOME OTHER SIDENOTES ON THIS STORY: Cinderella doesn't have a fairy godmother. Rather, she plants a tree by her mother's grave and prays under it every day. She finds her dresses to wear to each ball under the tree (there are three in the story, not one like in the movie). She is still helped by animals, though specifically birds, not mice. Also, she doesn't just lose her shoe because she is in a rush. The clever prince covers the steps in pitch to make her stick to them, but she only loses a shoe in the process.",2014-11-20T05:19:54.000Z,32

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,Out of all the disney princess movies they had to pick Cinderella. Maleficent was amazing because it showed another side to the story. The Cinderella story has been told time and time again. I think Cinderella is one of the most bland stories. They could have chosen Aladin or The Princess And The Frog or something more diverse. Aurora was a blonde haired blue eyed princess maybe take a break from that for a movie or two and show diverse princesses for little girls to look up to instead of the kind nice blonde haired blue eyed angel little princess. I would love to see a real life remake of The Princess and the Frog but sadly there are a lot of other white princess stories that will be remade before I see that. ,2014-11-20T04:48:39.000Z,4

They are also talking about a Mulan!!!! I'm so excited. I'm really hoping they do this for all of the Disney princesses. I think that a live action Little Mermaid would be absolutely stunning and they really need to do one for Snow White. They need to do a Snow White that isn't made for 1930s mentality. I want a Snow that is still a princess (not a warrior) but isn't 100% helpless and shoved to the background.,2014-11-20T03:32:42.000Z,48

(1:30 into the trailer)

ME: Nope, every single live-action version Disney does is going to suck.

This was flat, unenchanting, written-in, paint-by-number, and looked worse than all of the movies like ""Ella Enchanted"" which basically tried to knock off of animated versions. You hear that, Disney? Your live action movies are worse than the movies that are made to try and imitate you and be pale facsimilies. I couldn't even watch past 1:30 because I realized it just went ""downhill"" from there. Why don't they just throw in some evil army for Cinderella to defeat in a fantasy battle while they're at it and complete the downgrade... That or Johnny Depp.

I really don't care that they're going to ruin ""The Jungle Book"" because that was already ruined to begin with, but we need to start a petition to keep them from trashing ""Beauty and the Beast"" before they begin filming.",2014-11-20T03:19:38.000Z,5

Although the step mom and the stepsisters are beautiful on the outside their personalities are ugly and rude. The girl playing cinderella is by no means plain or ugly she is average but what is shining through is her personality we hear her mom saying that she is very nice and kind meaning that she has a humble and caring personality which is far more beautiful and important  than that of outer beauty. I personally think this is a positive message for little girls, young girls, and women in general. Beauty fades but your inner most beautiful personality lasts longer. I applaud the director for this take of the a classic fairy tale story. ",2014-11-20T02:25:20.000Z,0

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"I think this looks quite good for being a live-action, apparently non-musical telling of the Cinderella tale...although I am a fanatic for the Disney classics and don't imagine that anything could ever possibly be anywhere near as good as them (or the Rodgers & Hammerstein Cinderella, for that matter), I still look forward to it. It's true, though, that the trailer appears to be pretty much the entire film condensed to under 3 minutes. And unless it's deliberately omitting something, it seems to be basically the same fairy tale over again. 
HBC as the fairy godmother would've convinced me even if I hadn't already been expecting to like it, though. 


What with this, 'Maleficent,' the Sleeping Beauty re-release, that 7D cartoon (which looks rather deeply unappealing to me), and Into the Woods (which involves a version of Cinderella as well as mentions Sleeping Beauty), Disney is really putting a lot of focus on their earliest princesses--or things related to those original fairy tales. I think I would rather see, instead of just further lavish live-action remakes, some real quality continuations of the princess stories...maybe even crossing them over with one another...but that would take a heck of a lot more inspiration. ",2014-11-20T01:59:38.000Z,1

The answer is simple, she wanted to play a very nice character after playing so many evil characters. Besides, she already played a mean woman, who forced a young girl to do tons of housework in 'Les Miserables'. Robbie Coltrane, who played Hagrid in 'Harry Potter', said in an interview that he wanted to play a very friendly guy after playing so many villains and nasty characters. ",2014-11-20T01:59:03.000Z,0

Step 1: Find a book of Grimm's Fairy Tales or Aesops Fables.
Step 2: Close your eyes, flick through the book and prod your finger down on a random page.

Step 4: Cast Helena Bonham-Carter, Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham-Carter AND Johnny Depp. Or at least Mandy Moore or Kristen Bell or whoever can do some bubblegum pop to print Grammy awards.

And is anyone else bothered by the color of her dress? I prefer the light blue-gray from the original over this almost gaudy bright blue-purple color, which (as someone very accurately said before me) looks like something out of Nanny McPhee

I don't see it as Disney re-making a film just because they already did the story once. Re-making would imply they're basing it off the original movie. This one looks like it's just them doing the story of Cinderella again, with a much more fleshed out story and less singing. Not a re-make, but a re-telling (though I admit, they do use the same names for the step-family and the general designs to a degree, such as Drizella's weird bow on her head). Either way, though, this is not the first live-action adaptation Disney did of Cinderella since making the animated adaptation.

The Aurora's story from the animated movie didn't stay the same as the animated movie where they crossed. If they had just told the story of Maleficent and left Aurora out of it, the movie would have been much better.

I've noticed errors and it's only the trailer. First, though we don't know for sure if they met before the events of the movie. Cinderella and the Prince didn't meet. But that's me being nit picky. Second. The horse drove the carriage not a duck. I didn't event notice Bruno (the dog) Fourth. The mice don't talk. She may not have spoken to them a lot in the movie but at least she could understand them. And another nit-picky thing. Her dress isn't right.

I think i could kinda agree with what some people would say about this sucking........ i think its just because i'm coming from the perspective of being raised on these movies like so many others and feeling sentimental with the classic versions because that was what i was introduced to in the first place and going to WDW Orlando Florida so many times growing up being used to the versions of the characters there, i guess i could not imagine them any different.......i get what Disney are trying to do with the new technology is give these next generations the same type of experience that we had, being given these movies as children which i think is great cause its keeping like the legendary stories and morals alive but still it trips the fuck out of me...... and it sucks cause i cant see the same songs being used in this new movie as the original or any of the others if they continue to reboot them which sucks because they are for me what made the movies !!!!!( plus i get really unstable with change of any sort) ino its gunna be something ill have to get used to but yeh!!!",2014-11-19T23:53:40.000Z,5

It had a good plot for Aurora and Maleficent's relationship but I didnt like how Maleficent was betrayed by the man she loved twice. I also didnt like how Aurora's father was a greedy and selfish king who had no trouble in betraying a woman he onced loved, let alone a woman who had done nothing to him that deserved such cruelty.",2014-11-19T22:00:11.000Z,0

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"To all those saying ""it should be a new take from the evil stepsister's point of view"" or it should be feminist like 'Malificent'""

Yeah there's a plague of metrosexual libtard, feminist, gullible dupes and disempowered, weak nerds desperate to feel superior and powerful by identifying with evil. They live in their mum's basements and yearn to be a Sith Lord and claim some sort of artistic credibility by only describing their newest fancy by the adjectives 'darker', 'edgier' and the 'good guy loses'.
These types fawn over evil but when evil affects them they go crying to mummy and curl up in a foetal position.

Malificent was anti-male, New world order, social engineering propaganda. Pretty transparent to anyone with a brain.﻿
Here's why:
The reason that the globalist elite have been pushing feminism is because men are the biggest threat to their control of the populations. In every takeover or suppression of an enemy throughout history the men were taken out first. Men are more likely to view totalitarian authority as an alpha male threat whereas women are more likely to view it as a protector (related to women liking the 'bad boys'). Men are thus more likely to challenge authority and are physically more dangerous.

Globalist inspired feminism is also about societal divide and conquer. They need to destroy the social fabric to make it harder for familial relationships to form particularly between men and women as families provide cohesion and resistance against tyranny. So pushing women to abandon traditional nurturing female traits and to pursue male qualities creates friction as men have evolved to protect and compliment women not compete with them. Relationships have become harder to form between men and women, divorce is at an all time high, marriage at an all time low as women abandon their biological natures in favour of pursuing masculine traits, ending up with internal conflict and they are often unhappy.

At the heart of feminism lies deception. Feminism was created by the power elite as a communist tool (modelled off Stalinesque Russian female empowerment techniques) to make society more divided, more matriarchal and thus more controllable.",2014-11-19T17:07:13.000Z,3

I just want to point out that I personally felt Tim Burton's take on Alice in Wonderland was an enjoyable film. Not great but not bad. I know I'm not gonna make alot of friends by saying that but screw it, it's my opinion, dammit! You don't have to agree, just don't be a self-centered jerk about it.

Now admittedly the only thing I'm worried about the film is it's writer who previously co-wrote The Nutty Professor 2 and did the screenplay for The Golden Compass. You may now engage shivering with fear.

But this is director Kenneth Branagh for god's sake. He did one of the more well-known adaptations of Hamlet and successfully managed to bring Thor to the big screen properly.

Hopefully he knows what he's doing and maybe this could wipe off the bad taste of Maleficent and restore Disney's dignity. Not saying it could be good, I'm just saying maybe you could cut them a little slack.

There is talent behind this project so all we could do is wait and see.",2014-11-19T16:59:04.000Z,11

1) Cinderella's mother is shown( Did Disney showed her dining the animated version?No!)
2) The fairy godmother would have a bigger role in this film
3) The stepmother has cinderella's freaking shoe!
4) Cinderella met the prince before the ball
5) The Grand Duke would have a more sinister role in this version
6)  This movie would be told by the Prince's point of view 
Out of this 6 notes how many of this “ideas"" have been put to other  Cinderella movies in the world? 0 to 1 and all of you are saying it's bland,unoriginal, sh*t,bad or any other things that are negative please think again.

And more importantly, I love the meaning that they give back to the story about kindness and courage. The kind of things everybody forgets about when it comes to fairy tales.

I would've liked to see it from a different angle. Maybe from the point of view of Cinderella's step mother or something. Call it ""Lady Tremaine"" SOMETHING.

2014-11-19T14:00:02.000Z,20DF6U1HcGQ,Disney&#39;s Cinderella Official US Trailer,"To all those who will be complaining about another Cinderella film...

You definitely don't know how Hollywood works, do you? It's a big financial gamble if the studios were to invest in something new. If a producer or director were to approach the studios with an original story, then they, along with many other people, are at risk of losing their job. Why do you think a lot of studios are now taking the safe route by spawning out remakes and reboots? They know that people who are familiar with these stories will pay to see it. It's show business. Besides, there have been a large number of original films out there, but they're either unheard of, or they didn't do so well. Quit your complaining and stop falling into the category of a ""whinger"".",2014-11-19T14:06:35.000Z,1
