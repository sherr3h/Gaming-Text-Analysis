I feel sorry for the world we made for them while in some whey i judge them for not being like us - the old generation. We were all different, we didnt give a f*ck and we were just fine, we were so real and genuine...individuals in the world that was letting us to be ourself.

2018-03-14T13:00:05.000Z,y8lFgF_IjPw,Eighth Grade | Official Trailer HD | A24,"I am 24 years old now, and I remember being in 8th grade 10 years ago, as if it was yesterday. What made it even ‚Äúworse‚Äù is my dad was an 8th grade teacher at the same school I went to while I was in 8th grade. My dad was embarrassing and awkward, ‚Äúcool‚Äù teacher (still is tbh haha! But it‚Äôs fun now), everyone in the school knew who he was, and therefore everyone knew who I was. So I ALWAYS stood out, even if I didn‚Äôt want to.

I can‚Äôt sit through this movie without getting up and walking out of the room, because it brings back so many memories and makes me cringe. But that just shows it‚Äôs effectiveness! This movie is amazing and probably one of the only movies that accurately portrays what it‚Äôs like to be in middle school. Trying to impress the popular crowd, talking to boys, dealing with parents, and just all the other awkward moments that come with becoming a teenager; I remember going through every single moment of it all. It makes me laugh, cringe, breaks my heart, and just brings back a lot of embarrassing moments from that time of my life that, even looking back on them now, I still wouldn‚Äôt change today. Going through what you go through as a teenager shapes you into who you‚Äôre going to become in the future, whether you believe that or not.

I used to say that I would ‚Äúslap my younger self‚Äù, but now I think if I could go back in time, I would give her/myself a hug and tell her that ‚ÄúDad is right, just like he always is. Everything is going to turn out okay. You‚Äôll find your best friends for life, fall in love a few times, meet the love of your life, finally start to believe and have confidence in yourself, discover your passions, and realize everything really is going to be all right.‚Äù

The emphasis on the acne the whole movie, like you're seeing it through her eyes because that's actually how the main character feels about her face. No ""beauty filter"" outside of her phone, just insecurity
The fact that so many teachers try to get hip with the kids and bring up memes that have been dead for a good few years
The behind-the-scenes struggle with emotional pain the girl has to go through, hugging her dad who's always there even if he sorta embarasses her. As someone who's emotionally unstable, I've had times where I just have to hug my mom and cry my heart out
Social anxiety disorder, the fear of being around lots of other people. One of my closest friends has it

Nothing ever changes, those ""dorky adults"" and most importantly that  dad went through EVERYTHING you went through.  Replace those smart phones with some analog item from 1994 and you have what I went through with 80% of the kids in my school during 8th grade, and I played sports and all that shit so this is not coming from a social outcast.  98% of your classmates feel the same way you do, they are just to scared to show anyone else.  My pool party nightmare involved me actually shaving my armpits because I felt ashamed of my body.  All the other boys were narrow shouldered and hairless and I did not like being different. The reality was I was a full grown man at 14 with muscles and perfect bone structure.  There was no need for me to be ashamed, and the same goes with all of you.   I am saying this in the hopes that some of you 14 years olds in this comments section will listen to me...  If you are going through an awkward time, let one of your parents know.  Or an aunt, or someone.  Use them like a cheatcode.  Chances are one of them knows how to help you.

2018-03-14T13:00:05.000Z,y8lFgF_IjPw,Eighth Grade | Official Trailer HD | A24,"I definitely wanna see this. Middle school was the absolute worst part of my grade school life. I was bullied worse during those two years than grades 1-6 combined. It was a nightmare and I hated it so much. I was so happy when I graduated, even though a good chunk of the kids would be moving on to the same high school. HS was still easier for me, at least in terms of bullying. People were still assholes and a number of them hated me for no reason, but HS brought me my very first legitimate group of real friends. Yes, I had a couple of friends growing up, but I was always the very shy, awkward one that liked to be invisible more than seen. Obviously, I was prime bully fodder. 

Watching this movie will probably be very relatable to me on some aspects, but, as a child who grew up in the 80s and 90s, who was bullied by her peers and mother, I doubt it could capture the experiences that led to my PTSD later in life. Her father, especially, looks very supportive and loving, which I guess I can relate to, as my father was a very loving man. I'll always miss him.",2018-08-21T10:20:32.000Z,0

The probability that you will read this is very low, but there is a part of me that needs to write this to let you know the beautiful, spectacular piece of art named Eighth Grade is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. You perfectly captured the struggle of not just a 13-year-old girl, but of a human being. This is an accurate portrayal of life's struggles and the emotions that everyone deals with at some point in his or her life. Most importantly you showed the possibility of getting through the tough times and accepting ourselves for the weird, quirky individuals we are. I can tell the genuine feelings that you poured into this movie, and for that I say thank you! I feel this will have a great influence among pre-teens and teenagers (I am one of them), along with future generations. 

Sincerely,
An awkward human being

This is Bo's first movie and many stand up comedians that move to movies are not very good as they are two completely different platforms. 
Also, I worry about the premise, it seems somewhat generic and as we all know 13 year olds are not that good at portraying characters. This will most likely just be a start for Bo Burnham and won't be anything special, and that's OK as it is his first movie. 
Just don't expect anything great, as it probably won't be anything special.",2018-04-03T15:21:32.000Z,0

His penis was really wrinkly and crooked. Kind of disgusting and his ballsack looked like one of those flat purses that old people use to carry coins around in an inconvenient way so they can be slow at the cash register and piss you off when you are just trying to buy a fucking can of Red Bull to see if it gives you wings (it doesn't).

Eighth Grade is probably the worst though as you are right at that transition point from being a child to being an adult.  You have a lot of that in 7th and 9th grade but 8th is the worst.

I'm not sure how the change from Elementary/Jr. High/High School  to Elementary/Middle/H.S. has effected that.  All my experience was with the old structure.

middle school IS NOT the same as high school. Everyone is more obsessed with pokemon and the dodgeball championships than parties and stuff. This is already a shitstain stereotype of high school, but you expect me to believe it's 8th fucking grade? really? 8th grade is the grade where idiots run around wedgie-ing each other and stealing each others stuff.
Lets list off the cliches shall we? Generic old 2 story building made of brick that looks like some university instead of a middle school? check. angsty protagonist who is quiet, awkward and has acne? check. groups of ""cool kids"" with fancy clothes and cell phones who don't even notice the main character? check.

That‚Äôs my eight grade experience. 9th grade I would go into the bathroom during lunch and look up at the ceiling and scream as loud as I could to express me solitude for my body full of zits. I would then eat my lunch using the toilet seat as a table and made sure to lick off the side of the toilet to get all the pee I could manage to get. And then I rubbed my dick on all the door knobs and handles. I did this in the girls room and only got caught a couple times. But it makes me sexually active to watch another person stare at me while I express my bodily motion in a fashion they have yet to understand. Only to get on the bus and stare at this middle school boy where they shared the bus with us because our school was poor. When I finally got home I laid on the floor and put my finger in my butt and just laid there for hours on end until I felt it was necessary to put my finger in my mouth.,2018-03-16T16:57:23.000Z,1

When I see this trailer all i feel is depression and sure things could get better but that past is still part of who you are and it isn't fair that some people were popular and don't relate to this. When i am open about these feelings to people I feel as though they will just interrupt me and tell me to just enjoy life and not compare yourself to others and you can't change the past blah blah blah. I've heard it all and I still just want to feel bitter. Its just unfair that the outgoing people are with demons with equal magnitude but are different and more illusive. The latter of my previous sentence just makes life seem so unfair.

The fact that movies like this are basically just strapping a go pro to an everyday students head just seems so boring and uneventful, and I've already been through 8th grade, so what's the point?

This is like the Emoji Movie(except better but it still doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea), Bo Burntham, Burnham, Burham, is a bit exaggerated with some things he has made. The trailer reflects that the movie is heartwarming with choice of music and it is relatable hence the title. A normal person who uses Snapchat all day isn‚Äôt that interesting, which is my biggest point. If there‚Äôs just a single scene with media or online material being used to convey a message in a film like this, Take Wonder for example, the two kids talked over minecraft. I‚Äôd rather see the movie let the characters grow and have relationships together rather than her growth on YouTube, or how much the popular kids like her snapchats. I respect any opinion.

I made new friends after like 3 months and they‚Äôre pretty lit for the most part. However, I‚Äôm lucky. A lot of these people I thought I used to know are living in the moment, either following or leading the wrong crowd; doing drugs, drinking, having sex, spreading rumors... everything kinda just changed. I‚Äôm driving now. I honestly think that focusing on my grades and on good quality people has saved me thus far. Everyone else is either not focused on grades and is having sex and doing drugs. I still hang out with friends and stuff, but literally know one who is ranked #1 like me is doing drugs or having sex. Like only one maybe drank once at a party she was trapped in or something.

That's the last thing you want to be is yourself.  What if you are selfish, egotistical, shallow, cruel, never caring about others, only about yourself, always hurting others but 'you're happy so who cares' loser ? Do you want to be that? Its a stupid saying that millenials say because they don't want to face and look in the mirror of who they really are and change. It is nothing statement. It leads to nothing. No growth ever comes from 'being yourself'. Growth comes from listening to others, respecting others, and able to have your preconceived ideas of the world challenged and changed. It requires thought and actual desire for the Truth.  Whole lot better then 'follow your heart' and 'be yourself' nonsense.",2018-03-15T22:22:12.000Z,72

2018-03-14T13:00:05.000Z,y8lFgF_IjPw,Eighth Grade | Official Trailer HD | A24,"In the late 60's LB Johnson was upset because pastors in Churches had mentioned that he took the money out of the social security trust fund. Johnson was also upset that churches didn't embrace his great society program.
So Johnson attacked the churches. Preachers free speech was stopped through the IRS. He said you can speak all you want,but you will pay taxes on your offerings and buildings.
At that same time Johnson was not worried about teachers,and teachers unions speaking for government plans and against churches.
Schools and teachers are paid by the public,so they are even more entrenched than preachers.We had teachers,in tax payer funded buildings,preaching to a captive audience,that was underage and vulnerable to their message.
The teacher pays taxes on income,but so does the preacher. As a result we have had 50 years of brain washing forced on students and paid for by tax payers.
During Obama's first run,teachers were wearing Obama shirts,preaching Obama,singing hymns of praise to Obama,and they did the same for Clinton.
I'm sure in the upcoming elections teachers will become preachers for the leftist dogma and churches will remain tax free and silent.",2018-03-15T17:40:31.000Z,0

I guess the reason why is the fact that I never got into the social media side of being at my age (14). I do think me not going into the social media circle has befitted me greatly so I haven‚Äôt had to constantly think that I have to be better looking etc. I‚Äôm not the ‚Äòpopular‚Äô one at school but I don‚Äôt care, I care about being happy for who I am instead of having people to tell me how cool I am constantly. To recap: social media is just plain not good for people at my age because of what it does to everyday people and gives us false expectations of what we should be.

Edit: 
To clarify: I didn‚Äôt mean my comment to get this much attention, it was just my two cents. What I meant by ‚Äòunrealistic expectations‚Äô is that on social media almost everybody is trying to show off the best of themselves and showing their best photos of them. This leads to people who feel like they ‚Äòhave to have this‚Äô or ‚Äòhave to do that‚Äô to just fit in with the crowd. This is what I don‚Äôt like about social media.",2018-03-15T23:13:21.000Z,84

1. A beautiful, well-done and understanding coming-of age film that highlights the ups and downs of growing up with a bit of quirkiness to keep your interest.
2. A pretentious, pandering film that tween and teenage girls will enjoy the most, in addition to those who believe that Burnham can do no wrong.
I'm not sure I'll even watch this movie, considering it'd be hard for me to relate outside of the fact it takes place in eighth grade and it feels a bit underwhelming.",2018-03-15T06:17:12.000Z,0

Then I found out that one of my closest friends had been sexually assaulted in the fifth grade by another one of my friends and that she had been cutting herself in the bathroom between classes and that the school was doing nothing to help her or to punish her assaulter. This was the year that I realized that many of the people that i've been friends are really horrible people and now I only like to hang out with one of my closest friends. Fortunately I don't think I have it as bad as a lot of people that I know and I think i've done myself a real favor by staying away from all of the major social media platforms like instagram and snapchat.,2018-03-15T05:12:43.000Z,0

Believe it or not, life was pretty decent. I know some people think it's wonderful that their children have a way to communicate with them, such as in an emergency, but how many children's lives have been ruined by them? How many young lives have been destroyed because they cannot pay attention to something for 10 seconds that isn't in their palm? How many young girls have killed themselves because of online harassment? How many articles of child pornography have been produced, because some moronic parent gave a horny teenager a device with a camera and access to the internet?

But for me eighth grade might have been the worst year of my awkward adolescence and this movie perfectly captures that. My 8th grade experience came a few years before everyone that age suddenly had cell phones and twitter and instagram, so I can't even imagine how much harder it would have been to try and find yourself in the midst of constant media overload. Using youtube to exemplify this technological shift is genius. These young girls and boys are definitely surrounded by videos and makeup tutorials and youtubers who all make them feel inferior or like they're doing something wrong.
