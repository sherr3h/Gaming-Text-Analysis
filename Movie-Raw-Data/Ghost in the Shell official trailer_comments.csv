2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"While Major in this movies has similar question in agony where her ""Ghost"" rests, --weather in her body or else-- she seems really fragile and very much victimized which kinda takes away tough version of her that I've seen in ""Innocence,""
They did really good job at recreating a setting where weird combination of over-industrialization and nostalgia are simultaneously present (though I feel like U.S Sci-Fi film in general has great in terms of creating dystopian atmosphere). I would have loved this movie even more I they put a little more emphasis on posing mind blowing, open-ending philosophical view.",2019-11-13T11:18:15.000Z,0

( okay its an anime adaptation technically , anyway) the story is also ok. best is the world and the whole city is a  possible scenery. and the details and the possibility to modify your body if you had the money. this could be real soon and then i think a world where you can upgrade , modify or change your look money becomes more important. to be honest i would save some to get good quality body parts. for me the movie is one of the best cyberpunk or anime adapts. by the way the coulours and the look is its very stylish the lights hologramms and this part where she's diving. i look a lot of movies actually there is a lot of junk, a lot of movies how  entertaim u with actuon but  some movies are still epic and this is one of em , and since 1yaer i read more mangas and like cyberpunk so i shuld watch this earlier. anyway could identify myself with the main protagonist  great work.",2019-04-24T00:00:17.000Z,0

Most of the anime shows have their characters with brightly colored eyes, fair skin, and bright colored hair rather than the traditional asian black hair.  They DON'T care. Has no one seen Naruto? Also, go look at the Full Metal Alchemist film. Edward and Al are actually white. The creator of the manga said they were based in Europe. But the live action movie only had Japanese actors. Why do you think that is? Mmmm.... maybe it's because it's easier for them to get a hold of well known asian actors in their counrty¿¿¿ what a bunch of bullshit.",2018-07-18T04:43:02.000Z,0

Scarlett and all the other actors are the only good thing in this movie. The problem is just dumb script and dialogues which over-explain every banal thing but omit all the real stuff (probably it was too deep for the scriptwriters to read sum basic post-modern philosophy so they had to fill that hole with glorifying simple idea of individuality which was safer and commercially more feasible bet to keep the casual movie-goer and his uniqueness satisfied) Too much exposition of the world, killing all the mystery and subtlety and at the same time too much uselessly floating CGI's again added but for wrong reasons, ironically just to hide the emptiness of the world. Cartoon-like evil characters with obvious names, obtusive playing on feelings like every damn 5 minutes. I would cut first 5 minutes out of the movie completely. The intro unlike originals doesn't have any impact. Also the score is kinda bleak... aaand the biggest fail for me: Motoko Kusanagi was always just an alias not her real name so the justification for whitewashing was totaly unnecessarry. There!......

I thought Shells were supposed to look just like an organic body. I wouldn't mind seeing this as a simple design change, but it's so painfully obvious it was done to get a PG13 rating to rake in the most cash, because Americans are still afraid of nudity. The opening wasn't supposed to be an action sequence. It sets up the basics of the world, Section 6's militant structure (or is that section 9? Damn Manga's dub is confusing), the Major's job, and the abilities of a Shell. The story seems to have been altered drastically, with the Major being the first Ghost to have a Shell, but so many other things are kept the same. This just looks like as big as a disaster as Dragon Ball Evolution. I really hope anime producers stop licensing their properties to American film companies.",2017-11-25T05:03:03.000Z,0

I didn't have so much of a problem with the casting. But the script was a complete klusterfuk. For having such great source material. You would have thought they would have at least gotten a little right but oh well. 

However fast forward a couple months or so to Blade Runner 2040. Which actually performed even worse at the box office. Makes me wonder that both should have probably been better left alone. :/",2017-11-13T05:19:43.000Z,0

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"mixed feelings about this, some of the fanservice is really great looking but also seems pretty shallow.

The dialogue is really superficial at times, and while it touches on some of the complex themes from the anime, it feels like it just regurgitates them, loosing some of the depth in translatation, and just glosses over them.


I think the second half of the movie was alot better when it got into it's stride a bit more, i really liked the scenes with the major and her mother i thought they were done well, and that adds alot, as i think they did get over the major's feelings of lonilness quite well which gave these scenes more impact.

It's worth a watch, and you probably do get more out of it if you have some knowledge of the series going in, but it's nothing particularly groundbreaking as with most live action adaptations, so just set your expectations going in.",2017-08-09T13:02:12.000Z,0

People don't like the changes in the real film of ""Ghost in the shell"" because, it doesn't stick to the originality of the first movie and changes a lot of the things that the fan base like but, they have made the story clearer for new audiences to be attracted to the series and that's what people fail to understand is that this is a reboot of the original complex manga that is simply presented in a clearer way for new audiences to understand but, does fall short of creating that deep universe from the original movie that hooked people to the movie's storyline so many years ago.",2017-08-07T18:23:47.000Z,3

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"I loved Ghost in the shell 1 and 2,  and the series is beyond mind blowing for an anime.  But this is not ghost in the shell and not one single person out there will ever convince me of that!

I don't care about the whitewashing stuff,  the anime characters many of whom look like white people. 

But it felt like they took the idea of wow shes nude, lets add more nudity areas.  when she goes invisible, she normally stays there for that event,  but the trailer above proves that wrong.

and the most recent trailer talks of her getting revenge,  She never had a real requirement of ""Revenege"" and nor was there ever a need for ""Bad Guys""  these were Military Styled missions! they didn't need a Bad Guy like every one of these GoodGuy/BadGuy films just seem to have to film about.

Ghost in the shell was a Story, in the series there were many missions, in the first film it was about a Rogue persons spirit inside a bot that showed  unlimited limitations past the ghost body bodies original thought to be design.  thus -Ghost in the Shell!


I'm sorry but this is my rant on this film and the other screwed up ""anime to life"" films that America screws over >.>",2017-08-06T23:45:25.000Z,0

Scarlet Johansson is one of the finest actors of her generation & a babe to boot but when are Hollywood going to fund a movie that has foreign elements with all of the actors from those actual countries...

Its an odd one as the asian market were enraged by the choice of actor's for this movie yet Manga & Asian Art for many years has been clearly been drawn to look more western & more disturbingly i watched a documentary many years ago were a large portion of Asian Women were having drastic & invasive surgery to look more western to the extent one young lady had her face peeled straight off to the back off her head so the plastic surgeon could get full access to break & shape her facial bones to look more western...

I am usually fascinated by any medical & procedual operations but this one disturbed me greatly as it was not about changing one's shape here & there but ones origins..

All of these young asian ladies were beautiful without needing any surgical procedures & had no body flaws whatsoever that I could see but this is a major problem with the so called laws put in place with regards to surgical enhancement in that There Are None as long as you can pay the money & unfortunately women are the biggest culprits for this rise as you never see your true beauty & are always wanting to look like someone else, but to look like another race is really disturbing & instead of changing their look everyone worldwide  should be embracing their beautiful looks & heritage...

When will we see a true asian box office star that hails from America as i havent seen one since Bruce Lee & that's a ridiculously long time...

Sure they'll be type cast or playing 2nd fiddle to the main star but they wont be playing the leading role & i thought we'd turned a corner when Bruce Lee finally & literally kicked down the doors of Hollywoods racists attitudes towards who stars as the leading actor that will headline a major motion picture but as this movie proves we're still in the dark ages...",2017-08-04T20:04:42.000Z,0

As for the movie, at the first view i was rather disapointed. Not having included stuf a to z, yet alone re-writing. 

Some time later i can say; This is enjoyable, to me. 
And if it get's people interested in the GitS ""Franchise"" it is a win-win. 

Also, as much as i like the Anime movie, i really, really liked the Stand.Alone.Complex series. It's writing and caracker develpoment.
Though, some despise it. 

It is there, available for anybody to look at it who might be interested. Just do it and find out for yourself.",2017-07-20T15:28:51.000Z,0

They gave a reason for her being white and not asian which tbh I didn't really care about that much but just to all the people who are mad cause she isn't asian; her ghost is japanese and her shell just looks like a white chick which to be fair Scarlett fits her really well. Over all I felt this version had a more clear cut plot and executed it very well. It went very in depth on the idea of the ""ghost"" and the ""shell"" and I felt it brought much more to the table than the anime. I 100% regret not watch this in the Theater.",2017-07-20T08:30:01.000Z,5

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Got bored during break:
**First 7 minutes of the ghost in the shell movie. **
-- "" Deus Ex 3 synth music 'Bwaahs' "" Stop doing this...... 100% of post-2009 scifi movies don't need 100% identical synth music.
- Generic amnesia plot for the first dialogue in the entire movie. Was this written by the emo in the back of highschool algebra class or something?

**edit:**  Yup.  The ugly forgettable deus ex ""bwaa"" music goes on for 21 minutes . . . . oh and deleted some bullet points because they are selfish xD

--31 minutes in: "" Hack this, hack that, he's being hacked, that's being hacked, hacked hacked hacked "" Don't insult your audience by dumbing down everything into leymans-terms  xD

I will say though. I am loving the 'bro'mance between the major and batou though. lol  Guess that's one of the perks of being the director//writer. Do whatever the hell you want and it's awesome ♥

It's really strange though. It's like the first 20 minutes of this movie are directed differently(probably for that ""first 5 minutes"" trailer) and it really tries to put you off from sticking around to watch the rest of it, but _its like that one asteroid movie_ where the people get better at playing their parts later in the movie. It's really fun to see how horrible the first chapter of the movie is compared to the final 30 minutes, and even the music direction is different.
(p.s. sadly, nothing like this trailer music, which is absent. making the trailer theme of this upload total bullshit)

The big problem with this movie is that it tries to make everything uncanny instead of just letting go of the source material and replacing the more outlandish stuff with what will work _in real life_. The yellow-spandex effect and ""YourCostumeNeedsWork"" tropes in full effect. If you can't go for the fancy noir undertones and jazz pieces that the source materials liked using, try some other thematic setup. Just not  **the exact opposite** and this movie would've been way cooler

final edit: The amnesia thing I complained about... It's actually done pretty well. :D",2017-07-16T09:36:32.000Z,0

All we got from this movie was ""Memories don't define you."" Okay, cool. What happened to the, ""What is consciousness? Who are we to say a being or species is not conscious or self aware when it would be so hard for another species or being to figure out that we are. Why are we self-aware? Is there meaning to it or accidental? Is reproduction our way of immortality? But passing on our genetic pool as far as that bloodline will take us? Is a part of our consciousness put into each person we 'create'? Are we all one single consciousness that has branched out since the beginning of mankind?"" I was really hoping, with this movie reaching such a wider audience, that it would use something at least similar to the Puppet Master's speech to try and turn that little switch on in people's brains. One that makes people possibly more self aware than they want to be for that moment in time. I remember the speech so much from the original that I saw when I was 16, and it had such an impact on me. It made me take a step back at the bigger picture on a nearly daily basis. Which is honestly a bit scary but I do wish more people did it. It's such a shame they didn't stick to the puppet master and bring the same philosophy into it that made the original such a classic to begin with.",2017-07-13T02:04:08.000Z,1

This is yet another role where she jumps around and acts dumb and she is beginning typecast herself with superhero /sci-fi roles.
I would love to see her do something with a little substance, .
Ghost in the Shell is set in the future in which humans and technology have begun to merge, a cybernetically enhanced soldier hunts a mysterious terrorist who can hack into his victims' minds and control their thoughts and memories. Her pursuit eventually leads her to discover the full truth about her past.I wasn't surprised to read Ghost in the Shell was adapted from a Japanese Manga series from the 80's as it has that fantastical feel about it. Fantastical not fantastic.
It also has the feel of a video game which is perhaps why it didn't do too much for me. The first 45 minutes bored me silly but thankfully the last hour was much better.
Good special affects and fine performance from underrated actor Pilou Asbæk still won't have me queuing up for any more in what is quite obviously going to be a new franchise. 6 out of 10",2017-05-07T09:10:51.000Z,0

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"lil opinion from me.
i watched the movie.
i watched the anime.

soo i can say kinda tell em apart.

the movie is actually REALLY well done.
its something that bashes away the audience with an experience they actually put to good use.

sure, hollywood ruined some anime's
BUT this one? its actually VERY well done.

Scarlett Johansson is in my opinion a very good fitting person for the role.
at first i was scared the movie would ruin it.
but no it actually didnt.

sure the movie played with the original GitS story.
but it wasnt horrible.

*** SPOILERS!!!! SKIP IF YOU DONT WANT TO READ IT ****

the anime ends up with major getting onto the net, and gets out of her body.
she helps batou in the second anime movie with the puppet master.
not gonna tell more about it.

the Hollywood version ends up with a diffirent ending!
she.. shit well i said spoilers!
she ends up alive and keeps going with her team.
she lives and the ''puppet master'' aka in this movie one of the test subjects for a ''ghost in the shell''.

**** SPOILERS ENDED****

NOW! what can i say?
the hollywood version is a little dumbed down, sinds it does explain a LOT, of the story in a good way.
its a great movie imo.

The anime, is really for ppl who know anime's throughout.
in the sense of understanding a storyline without knowing it, searching the puzzles pieces yourself.
anyway.

conclusion.
watch the movie, both of em. 
i recommend it.
for ppl who never watched anime, watch the movie ghost in the shell first, soo you know the start of the story a little.
BEWARE! the anime is diffirent! soo dont say its bad, its diffirent.

now, have fun watching both of em.
for anime lovers: really guys, no worries, i wasnt liking the whitewashed idea either, but i gave it a try and wham. 
it was good.

just lets hope they wont milk it out like the usual movies they bring out..
*cough cough* super hero movies, Fast and the Furious *cough cough*

ya had fun reading it? sweet.
ya didnt liked it? well sorry i wasnt entertaining enough... go to the kitchen and grab a cookie.",2017-05-04T23:10:28.000Z,0

The producers of this movie are not creating it for anime lovers to enjoy. they're creating it to be well received by the masses. to make money. Scarlett is an amazing actress & an insanely popular one. They cast to her to get more viewers. There really AREN'T a whole lot of popular Asian actresses that could have brought in as many viewers as Scarlett. that's just the truth.,2017-04-25T12:40:34.000Z,0

Art: 10
Scenario: 6
Music: 8 
Enjoyment: 6

+Movie is almost the same as anime movie with nice little differences. (Main bad character etc.)

-Enjoyment is low because film has NO FLUENCY. Escpecially first hour. It came like 2 hours.

+Characters looking good. Scarlett is awesome as a robot. Really good. - But others plays like a robot too. -_-

-This movie was important for the recognition of the anime, but...it isnt enough. No enjoyment means, no second movie (i dont want it T—T) and no ""new anime watcher"".

-Uh...and OST please. I don't want to listen Steve Aoki remixes -—-  +Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe man! I want the OST so bad.

+Film includes everything: Drama, Action, Sci-fi, Dedective...

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Having seen the movie I am actually okay with how it was written it stands as a decent movie (50-60 tomatoes).  Some elements felt like a prequel which I found interesting but should not have been a main story point.  I understand the obsession with origin stories but they had not established GiTS on film so I think it was a little too hollywood to try to build in context for the major like that.  They retained enough of the OVA to use the title but I believe they can do better and totally expect a reboot in the next few years (like they did with ""The Hulk"" vs ""The Incredible Hulk"", for example).  Some movies don't need it (like Total Recall, which was perfectly cheesy, although I'll never turn down Kate Beckinsale on any medium)

Did the producers and director think that the public wouldn't relate to this movie without some kind of love story?  Did they need to humanize the Major so much?  Subtlety is lost on this production.  They should have allowed some interpretation.  It's okay to have ""Rosebud"" elements to provoke thought in the audience.  Part of the charm of GiTS was that you wouldn't relate to it by default. Sci-Fi is meant to explore the futuristic and surreal potential of humanity.  See anything written by Asimov or Clarke.  We deserve thought provoking movies that don't try to fill in all the blanks for us.  There are no unanswered questions in this film and that is disappointing.

Actually, it would have benefited from a lower budget.",2017-04-24T14:41:41.000Z,0

I don't know what it is about Hollywood and their hatred of Asians. Maybe it's ingrained or they are intimidated by them who knows. But really this appropriation bullshit needs to end. However in the case of Ghost in the Shell. 

About the only thing they did right was the cinematography. The rest was pretty much a hack of the source material. There were some other WTF moments towards the end as well. Way to ruin another classic Hollywood as usual. :/",2017-04-21T18:47:19.000Z,0

The movie is pure epicness, deserves way more success. Loved it how they had so many Scenes which were like poppet out of it´s Anime. Gonna watch it again. How Major showed emotions, proves that every human has his/her own way to deal with pain. I loved the bond between Major and Batou (I loved Batou, his actor fit perfectly for the character). I recommend this movie to everyone, it´s epic and legendary, will make you question about what makes us really human. This is so important, especially in a time where people are sexualised (especially women) and objectified in the West, where people are valued and judged based on their body and looks.
And really, Johansson´s acting was amazing. And there´s no ""white-washing"" when the audience is mostly white people. If Japanese people had done this work for a japanese audience, you think they would have Major and the others look white? The audience is mostly white and the characters don´t look japanese at all.",2017-04-24T10:38:12.000Z,1

I'm not surprised of this movie weak sales. I have slight suspicion that people paying for the movie production thought animation scored highly because of the see-through-costume Xena...

Also, Scarlett Johansson was a mistake here - unless it was something she pushed, A-list main star was too high cost for a niche-movie (except if it is not niche but then you can't keep the aesthetics - it would be like trying to produce an Ingmar Bergman movie for 5y kid).",2017-04-14T17:27:17.000Z,0

I feel lately like there are very few people in America with any taste or valid opinion whatsoever, and their voices are just not getting heard. I feel like the movie industry is very symbolic of this. People who decided to boycott this because of some ""whitewashing"" controversy clearly don't appreciate how much hard work and effort goes in to entertaining them. Did you think that these movies get made for free? You can just nitpick a $110,000,000 movie over something that the original director isn't even bothered by and cause them to lose millions of dollars over your butt hurt feelings? They create jobs man,  movie creators may as well literally pull jobs out of their ass every time they make a new movie. Show some respect. The movie is fantastic btw. One of the best anime/comic book/video game adaptations ever made. I can't imagine any fan of the original not liking this, and I've already heard people who are new to GiTS boasting about it.",2017-04-14T06:13:40.000Z,201

This is what the director of the 1995 Ghost in the shell thinks about all the suposed  ""whitewashing"" https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/24/scarlett-johansson-ghost-in-the-shell-director-whitewashing

And another thing, Major's ""racial problem"" is actually adressed in the movie, and the race change is tied to the plot too, the people complaining about this non issue didn't watch the 1995 anime, nor the Stand alone complex series,Arise series or any of the other  GiTS related stuff, and they didn't watch the new movie, they're all fucking pathetic at best.

In the OVA it was implied that Motoko was basically a human consciousness in a mechanical body. How she got there was never explored in the OVA.  I do love their adherence to some of the key scenes.  But I do not understand why they haven't mentioned the puppetmaster (project 2501) in the trailer so that makes me question how much does this movie follow the OVA? How much creative freedom was taken with this film?  The best parts of the OVA were questions about what makes an AI sentient, what makes a human human, can a machine have a spirit, Motoko's journey through her own existence and her ultimate conclusion, etc.  I feel like most of that might not be in this film.  I can't wait to see it, don't get me wrong but of all the adaptations and reboots that I've seen this one causes me the most anxiety and its strange.",2017-04-12T12:56:14.000Z,0

There were things it did well and some recreated scenes from the original were done pretty well BUT the context is completely screwed up so the scenes don't work as well. And yeah, it's taken away a lot of the thought provoking themes of the original. I'll say this though, it's the best live action Hollywood film based on an anime so far. I mean, look at things like Dragon Ball Evolution and Speed Racer, this is clearly a better product than those. But it's still not great. This was a risky movie for them to make because outside of the anime community, Ghost in the Shell wasn't exactly a popular source for them to remake. It's just a shame they focused on the less important parts of the story.

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,It was an ok movie/remake.  Me and my friends thought it was funny that the Japanese people were remade into white cyborgs.  It also was a change from the original message of the anime film.  Especially her visiting her mother and other aspects.  The diving off and ripping the tank turret off scenes were cool.  I did like during the film the major struggling to maintain her humanity by only being a brain inside a cybernetic construct.  The visual and artistic appeal was great in this remake.,2017-04-07T09:26:53.000Z,0

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"I saw this today and it was fuckin awesome. Totally payed respect to the original anime so for the idiots who just felt this need to boycott it because of this ""whitewash"" crap or whatever you call it, you missed out on a great movie. You missed out on a great movie because of your pettiness and inability to just focus on the movie rather than the color of the skin of the lead actress, ScarJo was awesome as Major btw and the perfect choice to play her. People have been doing this for years and it's not just ""whitewashing"" as some would have you believe. Fanboys complained when Samuel L. Jackson was cast as Nick Fury when he's white in the comics and they complained when Will Smith, another black man was cast as Deadshot. Both Samuel L. Jackson and Will Smith were great in the roles and I could care less about the color of their skin. Scarlett was great here too as the major but because the color of her skin wasn't quite right for fanboys they stupidly ignored it and missed out. I couldn't care less what the color of your skin is, if you're good in the role then that's all I need and Scarlett Johansson was damn good in the role. This whitewashing crap and complaining about a characters skin, including Jackson and Smith, in every movie actually contributes more to racism in this country because doing stuff like bitching about the characters skin color brings racism to the forefront again when we're trying to all be equal. People are so stupid that they don't even realize that in Ghost in the Shell it's just a body, it's just a shell, the girl, the soul is an Asian girl which the new movie explained. People need to just get over shit sometimes and just enjoy a good movie because I guarantee all of you morons who wanna ""boycott"" ghost in the shell because of ""whitewashing"" as soon as you see this movie someday whether it be on Blu Ray or just on TV someday you'll realize how ignorant you were for ignoring this movie for such a petty stupid reason.

The anime was created in Japan by a Japanese person but that doesn't necessarily mean that the characters are Japanese. In fact ""Ghost in the Shell"" was based in ""The American Empire"" aka the Southern States in the US. So i'm not surprised that the Anime characters look Caucasian or having a white cast in the movie.",2017-04-05T04:02:49.000Z,0

The visuals and soundtrack were beautifully paired to create an atmospheric world. The deeper meanings were present and were more of an updated version of previous answers offered. The story is complex enough to stand above generic sci-fi films but not convoluted or confusing. The various symbolic undertones smoothly intertwine with the main story, creating a fascinating film. The film itself has less philosophy than the 1995 anime, but there is some present. The characters are not cardboard cutouts; they're developed and walk a blurred line between right and wrong and their motivations are complex. Scarlett Johansson was incredible as an actress in this role, and helps add emotional connection to the fleshed out Motoko Kusanagi character.

The only noticeable flaws were a with pacing and with a few simplistic dialogue moments. The trailer presented a more simplistic film than the film itself. Other than that, I say it's worthy of theater admission price.",2017-04-02T23:34:09.000Z,1

I think the anime and film compliment each other very well.  The film answers questions that the anime leaves unanswered and vice versa.  Some critics said the film has an incomprehensible plot and lacked heart. These critics must have never seen or cared for the original. Because I found nothing difficult to understand in the plot and I actually think the film had more feeling and emotion than the anime. Only because the actors are real humans and could express emotion naturally.  

While I liked the new score,  I prefer the original score.  Also, the film is rated PG-13, so of course the violence was severely toned down from the anime.  These are my only complaints of the film.",2017-04-02T05:38:37.000Z,1

@those who haven't seen the movie: go see it or go back to live under a bridge.
@those bitching about the characters ethnicity: go do some yoga and meditation, at least open your chakras since you can't open your mind.
@those hardcore anime fan/otaku. You make me sad. The first anime movie, and sequence of series, along with the manga, it was all a masterpiece. Yes. This movie is a master piece. Literally IS the original animes and manga. The music too. The scenes are identical. The only 2 differences are 1) the spider tank is not Hanka red and 2) to be invisible she does not add a face cloth. Beside that EVERYTHING is identical. And enhanced by amazing computer graphic. I've been following Ghost In the Shell since 1996. Beside the music of Yoko Kanno ( unbeatable) from the series, this live action movie is spectacular and faithful.

Both of which completely ignore the words of the original creator of the series just to continue to push their stupid political agenda.  No one bitched about white washing when we remade The Ring, or Grudge.  No groups went ape shit over the Hungergames literally stealing the concept from Battle Royale and ruining the possibilities of the creator of BR ever remaking his movies. Grow the hell up people.

Why? i have NO idea! It would have been perfect after the apartment scene where she meets Motokos mother. It would have been a perfect scene to showcase all the amazing cityscapes which made the movie so colorful and a sobering moment for the viewers to contemplate our own reality. I was desperately waiting for the sound of the Wadaiko drum strike, but it failed to manifest until the credits rolled, and by then, it was too late:( I hope some fan with good editing skills would make a video from the DVD release with that song or perhaps they will include it in the DVD version, hint, hint.

Lets go straight to the point: Jsut watched the film 
• Took something famous and has a meaning to underground pop culture  and reduced  it to shit.  In its universe men and machines mingle and there is no way to distinguish one from the other. Life has no clear definition and cyber body  implants are used for tons of people to live longer regardless what they believe life or having a soul really is. Movie didn´t explore its main idea,Instead it tried to lure us with Impressive CGI art and a possible futuristic imagery of cities and its multicultural shitty environment.  Scarllet can  barely scratch the surface. She failed to impersonate the conflict of the main character. Wonderful lines for reflection  such as “  IF my soul is gone, what would happen to my body”? replaced by silly lines like “who am i “ and bla bla bla. 
• GHOST IN THE SHELL for Dummies!! Scriptwriting is pathetic. Flat acting performing. 2 moron villans who offer nothning interesting to the film. Excessive use os slow motion shit.

I watched the original movie and hell was I a bit confused but was amazed at both the visuals and the philosophical ideas. The new movie will do very good at the visuals if I base it on the trailers but will not on the philosophical ideas. Basically the new movie has a bright shell with a weak ghost inside.

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"The Major does not act in response to her body. Whatever actions she would react to would be the result of her mental capacities. With the introduction of a means for the mind to travel through the net.  Any potential for body and mind to be interwoven together indefinitely is destroyed. Following this train of thought we run into concepts that sum up descartes in it's entirety. 

The very notion of “I think therefore I am” is the basis for Motoko’s reasoning. That she must be something however her reasoning takes it a step further.  Which denotes that memories are something that makes up an individual. So that while she may have artificial parts. She has memories that are unique to her. 

While she seemingly has the free will of thought and decision. It is only given to her when she fulfills her purpose in the company. She aids in fighting criminal hackers within Section 9. But the moment she decides to give up fulfilling such a task she will be terminated. This also leads me full circle to the idea that our lives are shaped by death. 

However the whole idea that Ghost in the Shell was a revenge story is a hack in itself. There no conspiracy theory here as it doesn't exist. That's just Hollywood's way of giving us the middle finger. Visually speaking the movie looks pretty good but that's about the only good thing I can say about it.",2017-03-30T07:49:53.000Z,0

Pros
-It FELT like Ghost in the Shell
-Included more iconic scenes than I expected
-Johansson managed to pull it off imo
-Over all rather enjoyable

Cons
-The conspiracy was VERY shallow
-Ending was too tied up for GITS; it felt empty, the weakest aspect, id almost call it butchery
-Memories. By the end they made her more human, when in the original she evolved beyond human
-'Making of Cyborg' WAS ONLY PLAYED IN CREDITS :'(",2017-04-02T01:10:51.000Z,179

GiTS is well loved by anime fans but it might tank to a general audience, I mean who knows?

Remakes based on other countries work does not have to have said countries ethnicity in it. This is a remake for an American audience, thus you get white people (which make up the majority of the US).

Whitewashing is cases like Dr Strange, where the ancient one was changed to white when it should have been an actual asian. Japanese people don't actually care America remakes their animes nor do they complain about them using white actors. (watch?v=2DhoBuU1Dtc) ""Whitewashing"" isn't even a term they know there. It's mainly upper middle class white people and Asian-American 20 somethings with a distinct lack of problems. So they have to create their own to complain about and try fixing. 

If black people remake a white movie/show,etc = 'empowering' 
Asians remake a white movie/show,etc = Oh neat 
White people remake a black/asian show, book,etc = ""OMFG WHITEWASHING

Like that ""bad guy"" reminds you hard of the hacker in the anime as well, but the story seems to be wayyy personal. I miss her cold analysing cyborg feel. Like in the anime you see a woman but it is pretty clear she ain't human. She lacks typical human behaviour because from a pure logical point of view it doesn't make sense to be like that. Lots of small things, like the facial expresion being mostly the same, not blinking, turning around with a mechanical movement, not as fluent as the human coworkers.... 

And I AM aware the manga also featured a more humanesque Motoko, giving ground for an argument about this movie being closer to the actual source (manga), but the anime cyborg was so, SO good. I would've loved her to be like that instead of this obvious human version. I mean even the plastic face geisha there is blinking... wtf. :\",2017-03-16T11:45:38.000Z,0

Apparently she got an advance screening of the film or a sizzle reel as it's known. I've been to a few of those myself where they basically pre-screen a segment for audience reactions. Probably to see how much of a roll out they're going to do or not or just to write the damn thing off.

What seems to be pretty clear from her review was that GIAS was all Shell and no Ghost basically. From what she was shown Alachua said that it seemed Scarlett's portrayal of the major was a miscast.

They are calling it white washing. Look, I know that there are some shameful/disgusting ignoring/disrespect of ethnicity that goes on in Hollywood like having a predominantly white cast for movies of Egypt (a place in Africa) and other things like that, but I have to say that I don't see it here. The main character on the Ghost in the Shell anime actually looks more like Scarlett Johansson than any Asian woman I've seen. It is not like in something like Exodus: Gods and Kings or Gods of Egypt. And I am not an anime fan or anything, but a lot of the anime characters look nothing like people we consider Asian. It'd be like if someone had a character named Lee Chin in an animated film and he was a tall man with dark brown, chocolate-like skin with a lean, muscular build. You can't really blame people for choosing Michael B. Jordan to play that character in a live action movie.",2017-03-13T00:42:15.000Z,105

I'm more wondering about whether the content of the film will be just as good and intriguing. The trailer gives more of a crime action vibe than a psychological thriller and philosophical one. Though I do like how they've done the cyberpunk aspect in this.

The philosophy behind the original film was among the best aspects of it for me. The questions raised, the self-reflection and the deep discussions that took place. So many great things about the original and i'm more so wondering how they will carry it out in the film and whether it'll be as interesting, deep and thought provocative. So i'll reserve judgement until after i've seen it, otherwise i'm more cautious about it appearing more action-like than anything.

Though people forget that this is a ROBOT , which can be created as however you want her to look like... and since she IS a robot and non human she doesnt even has to have a nationality or ethnicity (im saying this bcs nationality and ethnicity arent always the same thing esp. for people with mixed ethnicitys or people of 1 ethnicity but simply just born somewhere else). the only thing that can be said is maybe where she was created (the case with all material things or any kind of technologic creations like here a robot).

I enjoy Miss Johansson as an actress but the Major is Japanese. So are Batou, Chief Aramaki, Togusa, Ichikawa and the Tachikoma. The setting is high-tech but there are many episodes that clearly state that the country is Japan. The relationship between technology and Section 9 is Japanese in a time when Japan was cutting-edge of the entire technological market. The Internet was a scary place in 1995 and the concept of the hackers was new and frightening. The manga debuted in 1989. 

The Japanese name of this show is not ""Busty Skin-Suit Heroine"". It's ""Mobile Armored Riot Police"" and the Major heads up an elite police squad that even has trouble staying active among the legitimate police squad and military. They're the elite of the elite (Batou's an ex-ranger) and that's why they can afford cybernetic prosthetic upgrades. Section 9 willfully signs away their professional lives and all their time and the enhancements are a free perk for the commitment. Otherwise they're next to impossible to maintain. There is no amnesia plot in the series. Section 9 tracks Laughing Man in season one and handles Comrade Kuze in season two.

Go on KissAnime and watch the 1995 animated film (dubbed or subbed) before you say anything positive about this tripe. Kusanagi faces and merges with a superhacker and never gains amnesia. I couldn't even sit through this trailer. I stopped it after 36 seconds because seeing Miss Johansson in that outfit makes me want to claw out my eyes. Not only is she not Japanese; she is not Major Kusanagi.",2017-03-11T12:25:38.000Z,0

Its gonna be a shaky cam extravaganza with 100 cuts in every fight scene. Yay.
A major point in GITS is that she looks like such a normal, stereotypical, sweet Japanese schoolgirl, and the contrast between that and what she actually is, is so compelling.

I even find this anime so perfect because it didn't take a lot from manga, which has a lot of humour.

Now, Scarleet Jo-ho-ho-hansson is a disaster for this role. She doesn't look or act anything like Commander Kusanagi, Purojekuto Ni-go-zero-ichi, according to this trailer. Batou is ugly as hell too.

I have no desire of seeing the actress nude, it's the character, one of Major's greatest point is how she had this beautiful body but she (gender based of her body not her consciousness) had no social constructs attached to it. For her it was just a shell for her ghost nothing else, but her surrounding did not feel the same way since they are human.

I think it would have been kind of groundbreaking to really show a new type of lifeforce living within one of us, to force the audience stop looking at the body from a sexual or shameful point of view, but I hope they will successfully weave the fundamental threads of the original GITS without it.",2017-02-16T10:36:41.000Z,2

I think on the downside, she might be the less talented actress (but does that matter much when the more talented actress happens to be doing the role wrong?).  I'll have to see the movie, though.  Also, she would be a good Star Wars actress based on the Claire Redfield character.

Both cultures are radically different and I'm glad more Asian ideas are being made into big blockbuster films. This is a Segway into full Asian immersion. So Asian people please don't fret I know it's angering but once they see the magnitude of Asian movies in America I feel it will lead to bigger blockbusters that will no longer need a white person cast in an anime inspired movie.,2017-02-13T07:30:47.000Z,0

Reading the comments it seems all the fanboys are getting their knickers in a twist that the main character isn't Asian but, in basic terms, had they cast a Japanese actress as opposed to an established A List actress, they may have struggled in their attempts to attract a wider audience and non-fanboys. At the end of the day, they want as many people to see and enjoy their film as possible as that directly correlates to increased profit. If they made a pure 100% carbon copy film from the source material this film may have only been watched by the for talk's sake 1 million fans of the anime. As before stated I don't like Anime and for that reason I never watched Attack on Titan live action. This however I will give a watch.",2017-02-12T11:38:07.000Z,0

May be destined for the $3.99 bin at Best Buy. They are trying to make a niche movie into a mainstream movie meaning a dumbed down version with big stars, explosions, and too much slo mo. I think this idea would have come off better under a foreign studio which would focus more on the story and less on trying to make it a blockbuster. Now that Marvel and DC are starting to cool off, live action anime might be the new flavor. I also don't think Akira will come off well as a live action feature because of the fact that it is the art and not its bloated story that makes Akira stand out. When you talk to anyone about Akira, they talk about the animation, not the story. What makes anime like these great is the fact that they don't look real, but are extremely well drawn. It's this distance that makes them appealing. Live action will take away from the art and draw more attention to the story which is not bad if the stories are well written. But looking at how much money went into the look of this trailer I doubt that it's counterbalanced with a well written script. This may go the way of Aeon Flux when all is said and done,",2017-02-11T21:50:14.000Z,4
2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Most actions scenes seem to be right out of the original anime (1995) which I'm happy to see. But what I'm really interested in is if the plot will sort of fix the lose ends that the anime had. They were minor and practically didn't take away from the experience, but they were there. As for the whole 'discovering who I am' stuff, I don't know how that fits. I mean it was never fully clear if Major merged with the Puppeteer or not in the 1995 anime, but she knew who she was and what she lacked. Maybe they'll use the merge part (if it's in the movie) to tie in the 'discovery' plot. That is if there is a Puppeteer as the main villain and not the company who created her. (Which now thing about it, created the villain as well). Because of that they could make Major and the villain friend/enemies, but I don't know how I feel about that since they were never on the same side. The visuals are beautiful though and I""m liking how they stayed with her 'naked' costume. Sure a bit more white, but it seems to work, at least in the trailer. Here's hoping its actually good, because both anime and manga were awesome! (Just as an off note I'm referencing things based solely on the 1995 anime, so if things were explained in the original manga or the TV show, I wouldn't know since I haven't read/seen those.)",2017-02-11T21:40:03.000Z,0

There's a whole country of Japanese actresses who could have been introduced to the world playing this role.

""There are white Japanese now, and not just a few of them.""
Yes there are just a few of them. All research I ever read on the subject points to single-digit percentages of recent non-Japanese ancestry among the Japanese population, and of those, the majority are actually Asian (e.g. Korean, Chinese, Filipino etc.)
Anecdotally, when I lived in Japan, the number of 'white' people in most locales was... well I was usually the only one. Of course you are going to meet many at cultural centers or events which specifically cater to Western-descended people, as did I - but that is hardly representative of the whole.

A movie set in *modern-day* Japan where all the main characters are white would rightfully be laughed/booed out of the room for being terribly whitewashed as well as preposterous. No one would swallow the excuse that in the novel of manga source set in 2016 Tokyo it wasn't specified that the characters weren't all white, so they just might be all white. It would be ridiculous in how unrepresentative it is. This GitS movie gets away with it (or rather the makers think it will) because the near future setting gives them a flimsy BS excuse, that's all.",2017-02-05T14:53:26.000Z,0

Have no problem with Scarlett as the Major, may not have been top of my list but she is a good actress, and has experience doing action these days. The people screaming ""whitewash"" need to realize, big studios won't take gambles on so called ""unknowns"" or little known foreign talent with their big expensive blockbusters, they want the big! names in the leading roles of their big! films.

Then we have underrated Pilou Asbæk supporting her, and he is rising a rising star in Game of Thrones, so I think he will do a great job in this as well. Furthermore, I rarely like the anime adaptions. Dragon Ball sucked, and Kickass was just about average.

I've looked into the anime/manga and can't believe I've missed out on it for this long. As someone who is always weary now a days when films of cherished franchises are turned into movies in which they tend to ruin the sense of nostalgia and originality, I'm not worried about this movie. So far by the trailer it looks like it'll be good. Again only judging by this trailer it looks like this will respectively portray the anime in its own medium and do well. Kind of how I both enjoy the Lord of the Rings movies and the books. I don't feel the movies took away but in their own way were brilliantly done well. I hope this movie can do the same.

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Same comments over and over again here...Look, name me ONE Japanese actress if you're in the U.S. Go. Couldn't think of one, could you? Right. And if you could, guess what? She's not a Hollywood A-lister. She's not even a ""D Lister"" (maybe that girl from Memoirs of a Geisha, let's say...). Fanboys may go to see a movie because its adapted from something they love. Everyone else goes to see one movie over another because they like the actor/director, the trailer looks good, or it got good reviews. Scarlett Johansson has proven her top billing status and acting ability. That's why she was chosen for the role. If the only people that go see this movie are fanboys, it won't make enough for them to make another movie like this one. And if you look at the how the character looks in the anime, she looks just like her. 

Making Shredder from TMNT William Fichner, I could understand those complaints because it completely changed the story. But this, c'mon. You're just looking for something to complain about, and while you do so, you make filmmakers afraid to take risks and deviate from the source material.

These scenes look like they're purely just there for nostalgia. And the fight scenes look to Matrix-y. Ghost in the shell is more tatical.
The philosohy doesn't always revolve around the Major, nor does the fact that the Major seems vurnrable, or always confused about her past. In the 1995 movie, she wonders how much of her humanity is stripped away, and how much of a robot she is. It's not like she has amnesia in the original movie, nor is wonderd who she really is. she doesn't really care, she wonders how much of her is left. She never had her life stolen or whatever. She was rescued and she chose to join the police force. Oh and she's Japanese. Kuze is Japanese too. Watch 2nd GIG.",2017-01-27T22:10:31.000Z,0

It will flop critically and financially. I will be watching it cause I am a geek, but watching this trailer a second time, I am now thoroughly convinced that it will flop. Just look up the film's pedigree ""Director, Budget, etc."" as well as the (significant) lack of hype for this film. *4.* She won't be starring in any MCU films in 2017 which means she'll be only as good as her last movie (aka Ghost in the Shell).

Non-Asian lead, I do feel those who choose to not see the film will 
ultimately hinder Asian actor's ability to get better roles. The very 
fact that we are going to see a classic Anime live action adaptation in 
less than three months is ground breaking. Anime has fought hard to make
 its way into pop culture. I remember visiting my local mall's Sundance 
store. It was the only store that carried Anime. I also remember 
becoming hooked on films like Ghost in the Shell, Akira, Venus Wars, and
 Ninja Scroll. I found these films because some one chose to mention 
them in a magazine or some other form of media I was into at the time. 
And although I was too young to appreciate them fully, I became a fan. 
Now fast forward to 2017 and we have a 150 million dollar adaptation of 
one of these classics of the 90s. It's progress. It may not be 100% what
 we want but its a start. If Anime are to be celebrated by the masses 
you need to have mass appeal. Charlotte brings that to the table. No one
 who is not a Geek of Anime or movies knows what this movie is. What 
will bring them to theaters is their interest in the trailer and the 
lead actress. If we can get them watching, then we can then more live 
action Anime. And if we introduce more Anime we can begin casting more 
Asian actors into the roles. Marvel is in the process of bringing comics
 to the main stream in the same fashion. Who ever thought we would see 
so many characters brought to life on the big screen. We have mainstream
 audiences to thank for that, not just the enthusiast. One day I hope 
comics will be considered accessible by everyone. And I also hope that 
of Anime. So, I beg you, if you are fan of Anime please see this film. 
The more people who do, the more reasons to make other adaptations. 
Boycotting the movie will cause more harm than good. So GO SEE Ghost In 
The Shell! :)",2017-01-09T19:59:46.000Z,0

I know a lot of people complain that the major isn't being played by an Asian, but honestly, all ethnicity aside, Scarlet Johansson does seem like the right kind of person to play the major. Besides, one of the hole ideas from the original anime was that her character wasn't in her original body, but rather in a mass-produced assembly line body built by a big corporation, so I think it could still work with having Scarlet Johansson playing her, in terms of story and what not. The biggest thing that I don't like in this trailer is how Batou looks. He was one of my favorite characters from the original anime(in particular, the second anime film ""inesense""). I like the guy they got to play him, but His eye lenses are way too small and just look kind of weird the way they did them. Also there were some scenes where he had normal looking eyes in the trailer, which he never had in any of the anime versions. Hopefully the rest of the movie is adapted pretty faithfully. I looked up the ""shelling sequence"" scene which they did for this movie and it looked amazing! It was about as perfect as they could have adapted that scene. They even had the same music from the anime film. So I don't know. Hopefully this will be a good film. I'll defiantly see it when it comes out.",2017-01-09T07:36:16.000Z,35

I'm a huge GitS fan, will never forget seeing it on a big projector in the back of this cool video rental place. I was about 8-9 and it was somewhere around 97-98, I had just finished playing my half brothers copy of Metal Gear Solid on playstation. That game was and still is my favorite video game. When I saw GitS on the projector it was the end scene where Major is fighting the tank, it look JUST like Metal Gear Solid except with some hot cyborg replacing Snake :D I fell in love. Both of those series just have so much atmosphere in their worlds, and sense of realism. 

P.S It Seems like Cyber Punk is kind of coming back, interested to see if we ever get an Akira hollywood film, then there's the new Blade Runner as well as Cyber Punk 2077(I haven't played any of that dev's games, but have heard good things. I got my medevil magic fill with dark souls).

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Extremely disappointed with this. At first I got quite hyped with the visual but then I heard the premisse for the Major's character: ""I'm looking for who I am"", ""I'm insecure, I don't know who to trust"". This sounded ridiculously shallow and cheesy. Really hope there is more depth to that. 
 
They could have gone for many different approaches for the Major; 

Oshii's: A dark slightly depressed but deep intelectual and introspective woman, clearly detached from her humanity but still with desires to dive deep into the mysteries of the new world she lives in and the nature of life. 

Shirow's Original Major: A tough ""gorila babe"" with a sarcastic but wit sense of humor that fights for justice and has a difficult time getting herself a strong man that can handle her, so she still has some lesbian fun with some youger friends of hers. Much more like a young tough but humorous ""female detective"". 

Or Kamiyama's Major: Kinda of a mix of the two, a mysterious extremely intelligent and talented character with a little bit of sarcasm spiced with no problem in showing her sexiness, still she wonders about the nature of the ghosts and her own identity but in her own mature adult away.

All three Majors share a common trait: She is a strong independent woman. THE LAST THING I'D EXPECT TO SEE IN MAJOR IS INSECURITY! Her identity crisis is that more of a mid aged woman, definetely NOT of an endgy insecure teenager. 

That seems like a really shallow generic main character. Seems to me hollywood still can't take Japanese animation (and manga) seriously enough. This is not catering to the adult audience fan of GITS that first saw this back in the late nights, but to dumb millennium teenagers.",2016-12-24T15:14:13.000Z,36

The best dramatic and philosophical scenes in the anime revolved around the Puppet Master. The story doesn't work without him. Its a real shame, as it looks like they pulled off some elements well; such as Batou and the hostess bots, plus the inclusion of Takeshi Kitano. Chopping key components of the story, and the death stroke of using Michael Pitt will be the demise of this film. Shame.",2016-12-23T01:14:36.000Z,0

The biggest red flag for me has nothing to do with Scarlett playing the Major(Lets make it straight as well that she never calls herself the Major but Kusanagi) but its the visuals, visuals play a HUGE role in movies and they shot themselves in the foot, the background is sooo distracting, and you can make the argument they did it to draw in the audience but to me as someone who's a avid fan its painful. Also the Major is not the first full body prosthetic. As a matter of fact there are several of them even in the first movie.

Note: This part was made after watching the trailer.

The Major knows who she is! She didn't lose her past, theres a bit about becasue she lost her original body she feels like she's lost her original ghost but thats it. Ugh I hate movie trailers like this.

One last note before I wrap up. Batou! No! He's ghastly!

I hope the best for this movie, and its going to make its money, what I hope is that it'll get people watching the original Ghost in the Shell.",2016-12-22T06:18:33.000Z,1

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"1) Looks creative.
2) The trailer smells of fear from the producers. They're trying too hard. It's like ""hey teen boys... look she's naked and kissing another girl... buy a damn ticket!"" While at the same time trying too hard to show iconic scenes from the original. 
3) The original is one of my all time favorite anime. It was almost profetic in describing social media and how we will interact in the future. Major is a character that lets you explore that world. This however feels (at least the trailer made it seem that way) that her past will be an important plot point. That feels a little too cliché and overdone, whereas the original was more about exploring a future world and what it means to be alive. 
4) This is not to say the movie doesn't look appealing or that I'm not looking forward to it. I'm just saying from the trailer it looks like the makers are too focused on it's success and targeting audiences that I get a feel like some of what made the anime fun might be lost. Again obviously it's all speculation. 
5) Best I can say about it is the look and SJH seems alright in the role.",2016-12-16T17:00:25.000Z,8

And there goes random screw ups big and small:
- Cliche ""wall running""... Also the second guy brave heroine shoots while ""wall running"" should've emptied like half of the magazine right in her wherever really, but screenwriters saved the day.
- ""You were dying - we saved you"" cliche crap.
- WTF with ""you are the first of your kind""!? In ""source materials"" - she got her full synth body when she was just a kid and by the time it happened, this sort of practice was already relatively common. And here you're trying to pitch it as if we're watching RoboCop. Also ""one of a kind"" cliche...
- 1:25 - I'd start blaming screenwriters - Chief Aramaki took a gun in his hands like once in whole Ghost In The Shell animated movie/series and/or manga universes and here he takes out a death squad with just 6 shots... But it's Takeshi Kitano - what else would you expect?...
- 1:30 - I'll just assume that you forgot to add the ""eye implants"" for Bato's character there. Also I got the feeling - somebody forgot about the fact that he has full synthetic body just like Major Kusanagi does.
- 1:34 - and that's where Motoko's motivation goes out of the window, right into hollywoods graveyard of cliche motivations.
- 1:48 - Ok. That's just sad. I really hope that guy was  not ""The Laughing Man"" character. Also another grave stone on hollywood cliche hero origins graveyard.",2016-12-06T12:54:21.000Z,6

I'm not really into manga or  anime but this does look interesting and I might see the original anime after this but damn just let this be it's own movie and stop complaining. Scarlett is awesome, the song is very fitting and the visuals look stunning. The action looks good and clear and isn't shaky cam for the looks of it. To me it looks like a well directed action thriller with a compelling story.

She has too much of a soft voice and mellow personality to suit Motoko Kusanagi. Motoko has a very wild and strong personality, also her eyes defined her greatly. Motoko's death stare and serious expression were one of the characteristics that defined her as a very unique character in the cyberpunk era and Scarlett doesn't seem like she will be delivering that to us.

I like Johansson, but after years of GITS, SAC, etc, I'm too used to strong voice actresses playing the part. The major has a strong, clear voice which nicely represents her cool self-assuredness and military experience. Put simply, The Major is a bad ass. She has the voice of a military commander...

Johanssons' breathy whispering here just conveys doubt and uncertainty. I understand she's probably trying to convey exactly that, since she is going through a sort of existential crisis here, but its just out of character. Even when Kusanagi was at her most self-doubting phase, questioning the existence of ghost, she never sounded this wishy-washy.

Who cares. I just want someone who can play the role and understands the Major's proper lack of emotion and reasoning thereof; so seeing the Major crack a one-liner and slyly smile afterwards is already off-putting (not that GitS doesn't have some level of humor). Personally, the shape of Scar-Jo's face and the way that she acts, she shows emotion whether she means to or not. Can she step up? Maybe, hopefully. We all want a good movie so all we can do is hope that she can. I don't care what ethnicity that entails as long as they view the source material and do it right. Instead, as it's a Hollywood movie that has to explain a ton of things to not alienate non-GitS viewers, shouldn't we be more concerned that introducing, understanding and coming to a conclusion in a two-hour film surrounding the complexity of the GitS universe is going to be one hell of an tough-to-achieve task?",2016-12-02T12:04:48.000Z,1

Another Japanese classic tarnished by American Hollywood. But, I am pleased to say that this movie looks like it's going to be really good. I like Scarlett Johansson. I believe she does a great job in the films she has been in. I think the only two that would have placed in my mind that this one wouldn't make it were Under the Skin & Lucy. But, I always have to remind myself that I can't judge an actor/actresses' performance solely on them; because they are led by a director. And that 1 or 2 flops (in my eyes) doesn't speak for that person's entire career. Overall, I am really looking forward to this movie and what Hollywood and the actors can bring to the table.

And it is here hollywoods life action version vill be different, they will take all the plots from all the animated gits series and movies. And put everything in the blender and create a long action ""soap drama"" series.
and they will milk this new ""soap opera"" for all its worth until theres nothing left. just like marvel is doing it.

Her humanity was up for question in the anime, but i don't feel the Major was as insecure and weird as she is in this live action version.

If this movie turns into a ""feel sorry for me cuz women can be strong too!"" movie (0:35 - 0:42, honestly?) imma leave half way through cuz the Major never needed to prove that fact, she'd just gun you down like any badass.",2016-11-27T17:43:08.000Z,95

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"seems significantly dumbed-down when compared with the original movie and the sac show. the plot seems more like your generic super spy with amnesia a la jason bourn. also seems like they sucked out all of the subtlety of motoko's character. 
the visuals seem accurate enough but simply wearing the skin of a good movie doesn't make you good. 
nice that they kept her orientation the same. 
not fond of them making motoko the six million dollar woman. if I remember correctly motoko was not the only full body cyborg nor were they some kind of secret. motoko was exceptional due to her hacking prowess and exceptional piloting skill (piloting the cyber-body) as well as good leadership skills, not because she was the only person in the world to be given super powers. that's more like the plot from ghost urn then ghost in the shell. not every protagonist has to be a singled out chosen one hero especially since that makes it seem like the character is only good because they were given the best toys rather then because they posses any real skill or intellect.",2016-11-27T00:50:07.000Z,6

Try to remember guys that this may be someone's first look at the GITS universe and could spur more writers to explore it in new and interesting ways whilst broadening the audience, that's got to excite you; potentially having more people to talk to about this amazing story.",2016-11-25T14:58:10.000Z,0

If you really think there's some racist conspiracy to keep non-white actors out of movies you're an idiot. Movie studios only care about money, so they'll chose a well-known white actress over an unknown Asian actress any day. NOT because they hate asians, but because they're selling a movie to a western market and there aren't very many well known Asian actors to begin with, mostly because they make up such a small percentage of the US population.

Motoko Kusanagi is really iconic character. One thing that scare and worry  is about 2017 live action movie and I am not really fan of choosing Scarlet as Motoko Kusanagi's role. Why? If u watch the 1995 movie closely, Motoko didn't make so much facial expression  but only obviously expression she made is that she was looking for the answers and she wanted to figure it out. BUT in the Live action trailer, u can see Scarlet made a lot of expression (sad, fear and smile).It is obvious that the actress didn't learn her role properly  But I really appropriate that the director used the original sound track.

The popularity of Ghost in The Shell will give franchise much popularity so it's a good thing even if movie is bad so maybe we might see more anime of it :D go watch it for love of a franchise if you are truly a fan and support it :) btw I'm so happy scarlet has the roll because she is one of best actress there is today and yes it's not white-washing because Motoko shell is a white lady and I saw ppl saying that asian should be main roll because original movie was made by japan... ugh that doesn't make any sense if shell is white then it's logical to have white actress doing it -.- sorry for my bad English not my primary language, hoping for well constructed comments here, love you all <3",2016-11-21T10:05:40.000Z,0

I'd rather see my favorite animes come to life in Hollywood by white dudes, at least it won't suck (sometimes). American white washed animes aren't flopping due to the white washing, it's flopping because no one knows how to make a decent movie from an anime. Get a major studio, A-list actors, directors and writers to do it and it'll be amazing. As  it stands now, you have a bunch of B list studios,etc attempting to do animes because of existing fan bases in hopes of making money.

The manga had a bigger story, but was a little drawn out.  The anime skipped a great deal of the exposition, but hit on the action.  However, both were intended for a mature audience, hence the nipples being human-like on both mediums.  This looks to be moving towards a PG-13 rating, which, despite Scarlet being the lead, makes me worried that American audiences will get the wrong idea of this masterfully written Japanese work and further the disdain by the un-informed audience of the greatness of such works.",2016-11-21T00:05:04.000Z,0

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Wtf, why is the story seem more about finding out about her past instead of trying to catch the puppet master(unless this isn't based on the 1st movie).

also just so u know the main character in the anime isn't Japanese, for one she has blue eyes, live in a city modeled after Hong kong and has mostly a synthetic body, unless the parts came from japan (the lack of identity  is important in the story).

and I don't care about white washing bs, I care about the story and ghost in the shell is a philosophical story about conciseness and it should be the best thing since the matrix but it seems Hollywood might be dumbing it down into a shallow action movie with good cinematography.

Edit: they are not doing Puppetmaster or Laughing man they are apparently doing The Kuze story, from 2nd season anime ""Affection"" ep.",2016-11-26T04:01:28.000Z,23

It tackled questions of identity, rights, and the ship of Theseus, while deconstructing the setting with brain-hacking counterterrorists solving cyber-crimes.

Tbh, who are we to judge? Paramount isn't working for us or filming this just to satisfy everyone. And, we didn't even invest a single dollar for the production of this film. They can cast whoever they like and film it in whatever way they like, if you like it just watch it, and if you doesn't, that's no point to complain that much since it's already filmed. The trailer looks great and it's so similar to the anime, so what else do you all expect? I saw many GITS fans are being grateful and happy because the anime was brought into a live action movie.

Some of the dialogue already is dumb in this movie, but as any TRUE fan since at least the GITS two anime seasons in mid 2000's can attest to, ScarJo was destined to play the Major since a live action was talked about way back when. And this isn't a joke or exaggeration, ScarJo has literally been the pick to play the Major all the way back then, ten years ago. But this movie is going to be dumbed down for the stupid shit majority public because a TRUE GITS movie is FAR too intelligent for 99% of the population to comprehend.

The producers are trying to market a very Japanese anime story to worldwide audiences and should consider themselves lucky they've got a big name like Johanson to help sell the film.  On the other hand you've got the live action Attack on Titan movies where they made everyone Asian in a story where it's a fairly important plot point that Asians are almost extinct in that world, but of course nobody says a thing.

There are only 3 live action animes/mangas being adapted to film in the in the next two years that are confirmed and the last one was 2013. Right now while sticking to the original plot as much as possible in the length of a movie would be appreciated by the fans but the main goal should be making sure this attempt to bring anime/manga to big budget live action films is a huge success. 
I personally do not watch anime (save for a few that I really wanted to watch after reading the mangas/light novels) due to lack of time, I can read whenever I'm waiting for something or if I don't feel like using a screen and need to chill though, but I had no idea this was an anime while watching the trailer and liked it.

The original film detailed some interesting revelations about the interface between humans and machines. Cybernetics, and consciousness, the defining characteristics on that field being moral dilemmas, and whose ultimate responsibility it was, the unsettling answer being that no one or thing knew. 

That's what made this film, and the subsequent series so comforting to watch, as, such issues are present today, in our everyday lives, yet we are unable to observe their effects on us as a beings living out of our mental projections, only within the mental framework of a dystopian future are we able to pick objectively at our own immortality. The answer once again, being that noone or thing has control, and this idea is made all the more startling when observed in the mind of a machine. 

The ideas behind the movie reference many an important philosophy, but, I think scientifically, as we stand today, theoretical neuroscience (a ways forward) and its understanding of the mind as a, ultimately, and, as far as the main points about it go, a learning machine, that, can, become a caveat for any who look nonchalantly at a humble stone axe made millennia ago by a bird, and objectively rely on the idea of a non-sentient accumulation at work. Because well simply, the mind of a machine is in the CPU right? well, you say, no, that's the brain. Then, dare I ask, what is the mind?",2016-11-17T09:20:30.000Z,0

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"They pretty much changed the plot big time and totally lost the main ""plot"" of Ghost in the Shell (Ghost in the Machine -Arthur Koestler). The story was never about Kusanagi Motoko being a first of her kind. And it was also never about her trying to find her true identity because she already knew who she was. Also looking at the Trailer, they seem to have mashed up action scenes from both the 1995 Movie, and the TV series GITS:Stand Alone Complex (The intro where she jumped off from 1995 GITS and the android dolls taking diners as hostages from GITS Stand Alone Complex)... I highly doubt this live action can be as good as the Animation movies/series. If anything perhaps 20%-30% as good. The feel of the show (base on the trailer) is also dead since they started using their over sponsored shit music and not the one's Gabriela Robin uses (a.k.a. Yoko Kanno).

The main issue with creating a live action of an Animation such as Ghost in the Shell that have spawned several Movies, OVA's and Series that are very successful on their own is that the Bar was set very high by the Animations alone which is hard to beat. Specially harder to beat when you make a live action that have a big change in plot, mis-cast the characters and many more.

Unlike an example..  the  Manga and Novel ""All you need is kill"" it was a Manga and Novel that was not as well known as Ghost in the Shell, it was not animated even.. It was easy to make a movie out of it and become successful Without so much critics cause it was relatively not well known to many manga and Novel readers (I have read thousand's of manga titles  and I never heard of that manga until I finished watching Edge of Tomorrow.. that's how relatively Unknown that manga really is...). The ""Manga and Novel All you Need is kill"" = Live action movie is called ""Edge of Tomorrow/Live-Die-Repeat"".

But ye, for this Movie to be successful. They have to produce something that can be on par or overpass the quality the 1995 movie possess (but I don't think they can...) Unlike Edge of Tomorrow which proved to be very successful. 

Even Edge of Tomorrow did not 100% Follow the ""All You Need is Kill"" Manga and Novel faithfully, it had a heavily westernised casting, and a lot of things were changed in the story. But it was successful nonetheless cause that particular manga and Novel was not that well known/mainstream unlike Ghost in the Shell which is more popular and have high scores on the Animated Movie and Series (which this live action movie have to beat or say atleast get 50% as good). Either its going to be a flop or its the typical Hollywood Influence thing where it only gained huge box office cause a lot of people watched it = Mostly people who have no idea what Ghost in the Shell is and have yet to watch the Ghost in the Shell 1995 or the Series (Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex Season 1 and 2, GITS:Innocence and many more).

I would say, if you plan on watching this live action, go watch the Ghost in the Shell 1995 atleast and perhaps Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex Season 1 and 2 as well. And then Watch this trailer again. See the huge difference. (Just saying :P).",2016-11-23T23:10:25.000Z,80

It looks like a typical holywood  action movie set in the future, with some kind of ""they stole your identity"" or ""bad guys are actually good"" plot twist, while the actual story of Ghost in the shell is about the definition  of having a soul (=Ghost) in an artificial body (=Shell) the contradiction in opposite manners and the value of a body (artificial or biological) to its soul or vice versa. Thats why its called: Ghost (your soul) in the Shell (the body). It goes far beyond some shooting scene and future backgrounds. 

The trailer gives me the impression, that they poorly executed the plot from the original story and simply took the settings to advertise their movie creating something for the ""mass"".
Yet again I do not think the movie has to be bad. Moreover I would say that the movie should not be called Ghost in the Shell  (as far my assumptions are correct) but simply ""inspired"" by what Masamune did. It deserve it`s own name, so it will not leave a bad aftertaste either, like the implementation of the Dragon Ball movie.",2016-11-17T18:51:18.000Z,34

I understand where people are coming from about the cast, even though i love Johansson. Simply because 'd love to see a Japanese actress have the main role for once and  the story comes from Japan, afterall. And at the same time, I think that thanks to ScarJo, the movie will have a better media coverage. Could have been the big reveal of an actress but that's only if people were interested enough to go see a movie adaptation of a manga/anime with an unknown cast... Gotta say, ScarJo's very stolid acting kinda fits the character from the 1995 animated movie (which is really different from the original manga character). So it was a bargain on the producer's side, you know. It's also part of the success of a movie, I guess.

That's their story work. If I wanted to read/watch the same thing I'd go back to the original every time. Its just silly to make a remake where you know every little detail. Let the director's tweak and change things so I can see their take on it.

When a music artist comes out with a song, another person makes a remix and uploads it on media like soundcloud or newgrounds that sounds similar but very different. Thats exactly how a director should act. People get so up tight in their tiny assholes about perfect adaptions of an original work. I just don't find paying for something I've already seen worth my time. Tweak it and tweak it liberally.",2016-11-16T22:41:09.000Z,177

I wouldn't think you would need to specify ethnicity in an ANIME/MANGA, 
especially when her name is ""Motoko Kusanagi"" and it takes place in JAPAN 
(a place which 98% of people are indeed Japanese). In fact when they do specify ethnicity or race in an anime it's usually to let the audience know that they AREN'T of Japanese descent. 

***Most importantly to end this debate, she was supposed to be a generic looking model made to look inconspicuous and be able to blend into crowds so WHY WOULD SHE NOT BE MADE TO LOOK LIKE ALL THE OTHER JAPANESE PEOPLE IN THE CROWD??!?!?!?!

Would it really kill Hollywood to let an Asian-American play a lead role in a big film? When was the last time you saw an Asian play a lead role in a big American film (that wasn't a martial arts movie). People aren't ""fake mad"" just because of this role but at the fact that Asian-Americans are widely underrepresented in American film.

We all know they are casting a white person with a brand name to increase box office gross, which is understandable because at the end of the day money drives the world, but let's not pretend it's not white-washing.

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Look i understand everyone has made the argument that Motoko isn't asian, that her model is ethnically ambiguous, Japan is okay with it, that ScarJo is perfect for the role simply because she's ScarJo, or that she looks white in the anime. But hear me out plz lol

1. Argument: Motoko's supposedly isn't asian because ""the creators"" didn't intend for her to be a certain ethnicity and that she's ethnically ambiguous.

Rebuttal: okay just because someone is described as ""ethnically ambiguous"" doesn't equal white. Her name is Motoko Kusanagi or as some ppl say is her alias, but that is her name nonetheless. No one knows her past and that leaves it up to interpretation and creative freedom. SO getting an asian actress like Rinko Kikuchi (Pacific Rim) isn't far fetched. She would've been a way better casting choice in my opinion than ScarJo. This story is a very Japanese one as it deals with Japan's close association with technology and how far ur humanity goes when ur fully cybernated. also they are deliberately not straying away from the asian aesthetic. If her model is supposed to be western then how the hell is she supposed to blend in looking whiter than a snowflake?

2. Argument: Japan is okay with it.

Rebuttal: This isn't a valid argument because it's like asking how Africans feel about racism towards African-Americans in America. Their answer wouldn't have the same perspective as African-Americans. Japan, a country where there isn't much immigration and they really try not to and where they have a homogeneous society, where if a Japanese person in Japan turns on their tv what do they see? more Japanese ppl. Japanese ppl don't really understand the concept of racism or whitewashing because they never had to deal with it. we (the us) have one of the most diverse populations in the world and hollywood obviously doesn't get it. they think casting the supporting cast with different ethnic groups checks off the diversity requirement and reserving the lead role for a white actor is ideal. I mean the guy playing Ishikawa is Australian! What the hell? im sorry. we have the diversity that other parts of the world don't and its about time Hollywood started using that and representing that properly. Its also kind of sad because guess what? ppl outside the us, sees the face of America as white. so who else would they expect to fill the roles of an American Ghost in The Shell? And its sucks.

3. Argument: ScarJo is perfect because its ScarJo and she make da money.

Rebuttal: The star power myth isn't really true. nobody knew chris hemsworth before thor, nobody knew jennifer lawrence before hunger games, nobody knew Rinko Kikuchi or Charlie Hunnam before Pacific Rim, nobody knew Henry Cavill before Man of Steel or Immortals, nobody knew Aaron Taylor before Kick Ass, nobody knew any of the ppl in the Last Airbender movie (i know it was bad) but that's the point....shall I go on? Ppl are going to see the ghost in the shell simply because its ghost in the shell not because of ScarJo. And secret: ""not everyone likes ScarJo"".

4. Argument: She looks white in the anime.

Rebuttal: have any of u seen anime? By that argument then everyone looks white! The key is that animated characters are perceived to be how u want them to be. How do u know if the Simpsons are about a white family? they're yellow. i could make the argument that they look canadian or latino for all we know. just because they look white to u doesn't mean they are. Also if u watch Anime they deliberately makes it clear to u that someone is foreign: blonde hair, blue eyes, telling u they're mixed, and also a funny accent when speaking Japanese.",2016-11-16T18:32:27.000Z,4

 Se vendra la segunda entrega con el hombre sonriente? Tremenda historia !!
 Me pongo a recordar y la verdad lamento un poco haber conocido el anime japones por ""ghost in the shell"", ya que luego todo lo demas palicede en imnovacion, calidad, argumento o contenido -a excepcion de Evangelion, Akira y algun que otro clasico mas-.
 Si no conoces nada sobre ""ghost in the shell"", mirate, bajate la primera y la segunda pelicula para empezar... Tambien hay 2 temporadas de anime que son sobresalientes.

I just can't picture S.J. as the major, though. No, not because she's white, but for two reasons: One, Scarlett, in my opinion, is too famous. I think it would play better to bring in a relatively 'unknown' actress. All I see is Black Widow parading around as Motoko. I get it that production wants to draw in new viewers to the GIS franchise with a popular name, and I hope it works that way for them. Second, Scarlett, as fine an actress as she is, seems to me to have a perpetual 'dazed and confused' look about her, where Motoko always appears  (even in her moments of severe angst) sharp and focused.
Batou in this clip looks comedic.
I do hope the Tachikomas make an appearance, along with, maybe one of those HAW tanks. 
Bottom line is, I didn't make this movie. I just hope they keep it intelligent, tight, fun, and that it succeeds in bringing credit to the GIS franchise.",2016-11-16T04:39:21.000Z,0

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"1st, saying anime looks white is a bs reason to justify her being white. They don't look like any race. No one in real life has a triangle for a nose, eyes that huge, or natural purple/blue/green etc hair. The medium values simplicity for faces. Simply that.

I'm Asian and I think ScarJo is a great choice. Besides her being white being totally plausible within GITS' plot, here's another good reason. This movie cost a fortune to make. You need an A list actor that can make up the money used to make this movie just by her name and there are NO A-list Asian actresses. You think Hollywood is like ""lets hire a white person cuz we hate minority?"" NO. They arn't stupid. They know there will be backlash. Hollywood is a business. They respond to profit. If this movie succeeds =>  more anime films => more Asian themed films => more opportunity for Asian actors. You can't go from 0 to 100 just like that. I believe this is the first step in the right direction. They can't risk leaving this to any actor simply because she's Asian. 

And here's another potential and unfortunate problem if she's asian. There are tentions between Japan, and China and Korea's government and a certain degree of racism between them (This is generalizing. Not saying all everyone hates each other) .  If she's not Japanese, (especially if the actor is Chinese) that's a huge major spit in the face to Japan, the origin of Gits. It will alienate Gits ""original"" audiences, limiting the search pool even further. I feel like ScarJo is a pretty good buffer for now.",2016-11-16T04:23:42.000Z,0

In the anime, the major and the rest of section 9 aren't worried about their past or trying to find out who they are or were, but rather stoping political and criminal corruption in their city. Major accepts who and what she is because she has no choice and cannot change it. It's a very nihilistic and tragic order of events that show the risks of transhumanism and turning away from our humanity to seek a high level of existence. Still, I hope this movie can set a new standard for live action anime adaptations, and that it does well. I feel more people should give it a chance.",2016-11-16T02:15:40.000Z,0

It's interesting to see the diversity of opinion on something like this!

Call me a ""SJW"" if you want, but I have a huge issue with whitewashing.  I'm a pretty race neutral kinda guy, I'm cool with anyone doing whatever and think racial ""roles"" are bullshit (ie music genres unbound by race, using whatever language you wish, adopting cultural customs from anywhere, etc.).  But why take an East Asian character and cast a white woman for it (who I will mention costs a pretty penny, Johannson isn't a C-Lister) when Hollywood and other film centers are filled to the brim with young Asian actors willing to do a role for cheaper to get their foot in the door in a massive way?   Why is everyone except Takeshi Kotano also whitewashed?  There's a case to be made for Bollywood adaptations not featuring actors of other races, because while India is ethnically diverse it is not so racially diverse.  Hollywood however is not Bollywood, it's a district of one of the most ethnically and racially diverse cities in one of the most diverse states in all of America.  I don't think there's malicious intent, like some cuckoos, but I think Hollywood and producers need to dig their heads out of their ass and realize there's more to film than just their usual recruiting pool.  People have argued that since the story of the Major and the film overall is a very universal one, that race does not factor into it.  That is also a perfectly reasonable argument, so don't take me as someone who's choosing a ""side"".

Besides that, this trailer bugs me on another level.  It's taking scenes from the 1995 film, so I assume it is a remake of the original film and maybe parts of GitS 2.0: Innocence and not Standalone Complex or Arise.  If that's the case, then why is it focusing so much on the Major's background?  1995 never really focused on where Kusanagi came from, it instead grappled with where she was going, what the new world and relationships between beings was like, even just the question of the nature of consciousness to begin with.  It was action-heavy, but it took time to focus on the internal narratives of each character or conflict in stride rather than just as a background to throw action scenes over.  The boat scene between Batou, the discovery of the Ghost,  the showdown, the epilogue conversation;  these were all narrative-crucial parts of 1995, and from this trailer I get none of that.  If the producers wanted to stay faithful to the original, why not take a more daring approach and leave us with questions?  Or hell, just pull a Full Metal Jacket trailer and distill your entire movie into a few frames and quotes?  As it stands, I know what this looks like: Robocop.  It looks like anime Robocop, and not the good one, the remake that was just meh.*

Whatever, I've spent way too much time thinking about a dumb adaptation I probably won't see unless it gets good reviews or an anime-fan friend of mine recommends.  Just my two cents.

*Looking at it closer, I think it's more likely an adaptation of the original manga, so there's more material there to be adapted.  The general point remains, however.",2016-11-17T22:53:54.000Z,32

Major is cold and calculating. At least looks like. That's all the beauty of the story when we see tiny traits of human emotions, just enough rear to suspect she actually CAN feel.

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Reposting from a Facebook post I made, so the formatting is kinda weird, but

Since this is apparently a lose
adaptation of SAC:2nd GIG, I have no idea why they're recreating iconic scenes
from the 1995 movie. Not to mention, there isn't nearly enough screen time to
fully dedicate to the Individual Eleven, so it's strange that they're even
featuring Kuze. The decision to give focus to the Major's backstory is also an
odd one, considering that a broader understanding of the setting and the way
that it relates to the sense of self is needed to appreciate her background as
a whole. Not to mention, the notion that the Major could be the only one of
anything is incredibly strange, considering that the usual GiTS overarching
theme of questioning the self only holds up when ones body is no longer a
subject of individuality. 



It's also concerning that we don't see the rest of
Section 9. While I can understand the exclusion of Pazu, Bouma, and Seito, I'm
concerned that we don't see any of Togusa, considering how essential of a
supporting character he is for most of SAC. 



The action shots look incredibly un-GiTS like. Most
of what made the Major a strong character was her ability to lead and command
others, both during combat and out. She rarely fought alone (only twice in the
97 movie, and only around three times, give or take, in SAC), and she was never
did crazy acrobatics. While this change is understandable in the context of
Hollywood movie, more considerations should have been taken to accommodate for
the tone of GiTS.",2016-11-15T21:04:15.000Z,0

The questions about humanity and what defines it are ingenious in my opinion but I guess the screen time on a full feature film doesn't leave that much room for other than the action parts.

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"I'm willing to give the movie a try. Honestly though, I'll be more surprised if it's actually good. Live action movies usually suck, so I'm hoping that they've at least done a decent job with this one. I'm always willing to give movies a chance--especially considering how much I love all the GitS anime, manga and guides. As far as saying most Japanese people don't care about the casting, that may or may not be true. I don't think that the opinions of few represent the opinions of many. So unless someone polls most or every single Japanese Ghost in the Shell fan in Japan, that statement is a bit hard to accept. Not saying it's right or wrong, but it really doesn't prove anything except for there are 'some' Japanese people who don't mind. Some might actually hate it, but they're less likely to complain about it since it's not anything pressing. It's just a movie. Also, Sam Yoshiba, a publisher at Kodansha, said he was fine with the Scarlett Johansson. As far as I know, the author/creator never stated that him self.

While I understand both sides of the argument, I also understand that this is an adaptation. Even the people over at Kondansha realized (and said) that since this was a Hollywood movie, they never even expected Motoko's actress to be Japanese. They never said she was or wasn't Japanese. Just that considering who was spearheading the movie, they didn't expect her to be. Take that statement as you'd like. Not saying anybody is wrong; to each their own. I'm willing to give it a try.",2016-11-15T19:16:14.000Z,1

I mean if you REALLY want total universality of every race in every aspect of art (something plain wrong as nobody outside the creators of something  should have word in what the final creation will be like, or else it's not art but a try to soothe the masses, something no sane person wants) you should have no problem with throwing say a freaking COUPLE of western characters in an Asian setting? And why even bother reacting according to the freaking RACES of the actors, if you state humans cannot be divided in races? I mean, if everyone in the film was japanese - that is if there were like 2-3 more japanese actors in the movie, namely the 2-3 main characters depicted, NONE of you would flip an eye.

Ghost In The Shell (anime) Is extremely known in Japan. Out of there... Maybe... Aparentily the intention of the entire production involved, Is that the film reaches the largest number of people. And what is the best way to do this? Putting a person or an actress who is known worldwide, who has charisma, and knows how to act... ""Oh, but she is a terrible actress"", my left egg... Did they just called her for being a cute girl? Of corse not... Sexy and beautiful girls have in all of the entire world, but excellent actress, very fews. 

I'm not a fan of her (only Clint Eastwood, he is mythologic...), but I think she is a good actress, has charisma e does the people get up the ass of the couch and go to se a movie, she deserves everything she has achieved... Don't have secret... If you won't that your movie be a failure, you need a ""cake recipe""... 

I love Ghost In The Shell and I did not even knows that Scarlett would be the ""Major"" until I see the trailer. From what I've seen so far from the film (apparently a super production) and knowing the history of the anime... I hope it is an excellent movie, I will watch with the open mind, even because if it gets bad, I will watch the anime again and life goes on... 

Now, what piss me off is that... Think about the money invested, commitment and work that everyone had to do to this movie come true and arrive to you... And after that, come some people to denigrate this without watch it... But the  life is this, the people are prejudiced (any opinion or feeling conceived without critical examination)... 

I miss the time when the people talked shit only after watching the movie, where people complained less about everything...
If you want to say that the movie is bad and give your opinion... great! Your right ... But does this after watching the movie, otherwise your criticism has no basis and are worthless...

Do not be stupid with Scarlett and the others. They do not it with you... And sorry for my english, I'm brazilian ""porra""...",2016-11-15T14:14:18.000Z,0

The original creator visited the set and loves the cast and thinks this will be the most beautiful film yet. (Refering to all previous films). If it's something he likes, that's good enough for me.

In the manga/anime, Kusanagi was more or less pulverised in an accident as a child, and she became a full body cyborg afterwards. She learned to control her cybernetics while her brain was still young and flexible, and the reason she is badass was not because ""[she] is the first of [her] kind!"", but more that she is a prodigious mind naturally at home in a military grade full body prosthesis. In the first episode of Stand Alone Complex, the plot revolved around someone masquerading as a Geisha-sexbot, putting their own brain inside the full body prosthesis of a prominent Japanese politician. When she herself was ""cyberized"", a fellow survivor of the plain crash agreed to the same a couple of days after she visited him in her new body. I hope they don't butcher Kusanagi's character by making her awesome because she is some ""chosen one"", instead of a driven and intelligent woman pursuing a career in law enforcement.",2016-11-15T11:14:54.000Z,0

Hopefully I'm wrong and we'll finally get the first GOOD live action anime adaptation... at least when it comes to an American film crew since there have been good anime live action films... just... all of them have been made in Japan. Maybe other film makers will be able to take notes and figure out how to make a good film. Maybe we'll be able to get a good Dragon Ball film instead of the train wreck that came out years ago.

They arent even saying what its rated its gotta be R or Nc-17 to much guns firing plus she is nude even the nipples aren't showing it is still sexually suggestive.

Isn't the true Asiatic man from Africa ? So many questions i have I'd hate to rip this film apart from so many angles (dimensions) but what i see from the previews I can tell I would  is   this isnt worth my money maybe if i got tickets to screening i would probably watch it but that is a deep maybe, it might seem as if Iam going off into tangents, that this whoever  is reading this that it isnt concise but i promise you Iam no troll just someone who knows he is in a position of great authority to say what he is saying and with that said i will say this what is up with star wars saga america needs a new hero action movie that they can look at, I mean the matrix series was how many years ago?

Japan is predominantly Japanese. And yes Japanese people are ok with this but why not cast Japanese people? I'm just curious, yes America is mostly white people but who is the movie catering to?  Are they trying to say that ""white America"" would only be interested in the movie cause there are white people in it.. in Japan.. or are they saying in the future white people take over japan... or perhaps they don't understand their audience like most producers who make pre-researched judgements, cause their audience really likes a Japanese things..*anime*cough*.. probably that last one. Just saying...

Also, I can't wait to see the movie. It seems like everyone working on the movie did their job fantastically except for casting... I'm still not talking about Scarlett, cause she will alone pull the non-anime fans to watch the movie... they didn't need to change everyone else...or the extras...",2016-11-15T07:20:55.000Z,0

Despite your dissatisfaction with the casting, you all gotta admit the GitS vibe is there! Even though I wish the Major was played by a Japanese actress, I think this is only the beginning and Hollywood is actually heading to a good start when it comes to live actions. Look at it this way, if this movie does well when it comes out, imagine other animes getting a live action with the same high quality as this! They might even be open with the idea of using asian actors too if this live action exceeds everyone's expectations and anime is acknowledge by the general public. Screw that Dragon Ball Z and other shitty live actions, this is where good anime starts to get the respect and recognition it deserves from Hollywood.

Why bother if you're just going to lift material from the anime movie so you can be compared to it when there is so goddam much material to work from in the manga?

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"It's a sad attempt by the so called ""fans"" who are not familiar with the Major's background to always bring up race when in the manga and anime her ethnicity was never disclosed. She can manifest herself into anything since she is an artificial intelligence with an artificial body but implanted with a human brain. ""Artificial body"" should give you a hint that she can look European, Japanese, African, or whatever ethnicity she chooses since she is now an artificial intelligence. In the anime she experiences plenty of near death scenarios to a point where her body is almost completely destroyed. She is brought back to life by her organization by fixing her all over again therefore, she can look different if her organization wishes by giving her another artificial body. 

Masamune Shirow, the original author of the manga, indicated that the concept of GitS is global, meaning it is a story blended with Western and Japanese themes. The story was based on humanity's increasing reliance on the internet and technology, which is prevalent today. The advent of the internet in America, specifically Google, influenced the story and Masamune also researched studies from Japanese universities about technology's impact throughout the world therefore, the story is about humanity losing a sense of identity due to our reliance and obsession with technology.

Plus, I find it ironic when people say race when we are all human. What they mean is ethnicity. Either way, the Major has a dilemma about her identity, whether she is purely ai or human. In the anime she said she does not know if her memories are hers or from someone else since her brain was implanted. 

However, she has grown so accustomed to her life as a cyborg agent owned by the Japanese government. Her body was manufactured by her organization so she is an important asset to them therefore, she lost her identity as a human when she had to undergo critical cybernetic enhancement as a very young child around the age of six.

Before anyone brings up her name being Motoko Kusanagi, well that does not automatically qualify her as being Japanese. My name is Christian Gonzales. People automatically assume that I am Hispanic when I am actually Filipino. I may be Filipino but I identify myself as American because I have never been nor grew up in the Philippines, so I don't know anything about their culture but America's. I have plenty of Korean friends who have names that don't sound like the culture of their ethnicity like Daniel Johnson or Michael Trenton. People come from all over the world so I would not be surprised to see an African or a European  with a Japanese name in Japan if they have breathe and lived the culture ever since they were born there.

Point is, the Major's ethnicity was never disclosed in the anime or manga but her race certainly was and that is maybe human (her human implanted brain) or maybe artificial intelligence. Also, there was the fact that as a child she had to undergo major cybernetic enhancement in order to live due to a life threatening accident. 

The story is about her trying to find out her identity ever since she changed into an advanced cyborg.

Before you call me a bigot for supporting the whitewashing in the Hollywood film industry, of which there is, I don't see that applying in this setting. It is appropriate for someone like ScarJo to be casted in this story because she really pulls off the character of Major well. I am impressed by her performance so far, but I will reserve judgement about the film until it releases. 

To reiterate, the Major is a character with a lost identity with a past of a human as a child but a current life of an artificial intelligence. She has a dual race as a  human and ai but an unknown ethnicity, and the story is not exclusively a Japanese concept but blended with Western and global influence.﻿",2016-11-16T20:51:02.000Z,334

Comparing it to the anime where tranquility amidst chaos reigned rampant, this provides me with a sense of realism being forced, what do you guys think? I feel the ultimate disappointment when it came to the remaining team being cast/ how they look compared to the original. Maybe what's actually going to spoil it for me is going to be all the scenes where I remember how different the tone, the atmosphere that the world was seeming drowning in, the visual representation of something so unadaptable.

The anime Ghost in the Shell was deep and dark, and while the graphics for the scenery are amazing, I'm already getting the impression this movie is going to be lackluster.

B) The Major is practical, first and foremost. In the original if she's not planning on using her cloak then she's wearing regular body armour (cloak underneath). In the trailer at 0:25 she's assaulting some...place without armour and without her cloak? Why?
C) Is this going to be a ""let's recreate the iconic scenes, add nothing new, slay the story"" type of deal? It smells like it...

But the music was a great disappointment. The OST by Kenji Kawai was so perfect that I feel it is almost irreplaceable. The anime's intro song just set the tone for the whole movie in such a special way, it gives me chills everytime I hear it. I really hope that they consider using songs like the anime's OST and not only cyberpunk remixed versions of 80's/early 90's hits...

This is now the second spin off movie Rupert has directed in the last five years, honestly the bloke needs to work on some original content. 
Also a major shout out to the hack writers who just wrote bloody fanfiction and suckered a bunch of rich idiots to fund this crap fest. 
And look at Scarlett throwing herself into another role, she is a great actress so maybe she can pull of the character. 
I predict this is gonna make a nice profit at the cinema, mainly due to the amount of butt-hurt Weeboos wanting to see how Hollywood ""Fucked Up"" their OP's and Waifu's.

I'm also glad that Scarlett was interested in the story. It's a Hollywood production and therefore an American adaption, but I believe it isn't simply about whitewashing but about giving the movie a strong character that is proven to attract audience.

Also, this will make the movie much more high profile and attract mainstream audience instead of comic fans only. Great chance to show how complex and well written manga can be.

Don't forget that if you want to see more Asian actors in movies support movies that feature Asian actors! Numbers is what studios understand.

Not impressed. May still see it but Scarlet Johannsen does seem miscast. Not the whole whitewashing thing but I don't buy her character vs. the Major of the anime.

I mean, remember Pacific Rim? Yeah, the female lead was asian and the movie was very much inspired by mecha animes, and most people though the movie sucked for those sole reasons. Imagine if Ghost in the Shell had an asian lead, *so many people* wouldn't watch just because of that. So my hope is that by having a white lead, although it is sad, at least it makes people watch and enjoy, and then maybe watch the anime and realize it's still a good story even without a white protagonist. It's my hope that we can make people watch movies with asian characters and not assume it is bad.",2016-11-14T19:09:02.000Z,2

Also, what's up with the Major being the ""first of her kind""? They're pretty much _all_ cyborgs to some extend (or at least a lot of them) or am I horribly misremembering this? Feels like they were trying to give her a little added backstory but what they really did was butcher the setting. The whole question of identity thing works a lot better if the technology is ubiquitous and a part of everyday life for (nearly) everyone. If the main character is just ""oh so special"" again it kinda makes it more bland... I don't know... I'm not feeling it and it has nothing to do with the casting...",2016-11-14T19:05:17.000Z,0

No, it's not cool to change the story like this. The point of GITS is to explore what it means to be human in an increasingly fuzzy AI world, terrorism, war etc, from a multitude of perspectives. It never needed cheap cliches and there was intellectual respect for the audiences. Motoko Kusanagi is supposed be La  Femme Nikita's Madeleine level of greatness. Her exact LACK of identity crisis, capacity for emotional adjustment, strategic prowess, leadership and political skills ,used to be the most lovable things about her.

GITS is not a franchise that is very well known to the whole world, so they have to sell it to everyone, not just to GITS fans.  You can also take a look at Jpanaese anime itself and notice that the characters, as in most anime don't actually look Japanese or Asian. They look western.

이렇게 진지한 사이버 펑크 작품의 예고편으로 보면서 크게 웃었던 적은 처음입니다.
01:13 B급 영화의 그래픽입니까? 그리고 이어지는 01:28 바트의 동그랑땡 안구는 정말이지 충격과 공포군요.
파라마운틴, 드림웍스는 작품이 이렇게 엇나가는동안 아무 제재를 안했다는게 놀랍습니다.
그냥 새로운 이야기로 진행하지 왜 1995년 극장판과, TV판의 이야기를 넣어어서 원작을 욕보이는거죠. 어설프게 원작의 장면들을 집어넣고 마코토 소령은 스칼렛 요한슨으로  어색함의 극치를 찍었네요. 기계적이면서 차가운 카리스마는 던져버리고 헐벗은체 뛰어놓는 스트립 걸로 만들어놨습니다. 몸뚱이도 찰흙으로 빗어놓은 것처럼 만들어놓고, 12세 관람가로 만들고 싶었나? 그냥 성인용으로 만들지. 원작팬 + 스칼렛 요한슨 고용으로 마블팬 + 저연령층의 관객으로 돈을 벌고 싶었나봅니다.
음악은 기대를 안했지만 역시나 원작의 사이버 펑크 느낌은 전무하고, 그렇다고 신선한 사이버 펑크의 느낌도 전혀 없이 그저그런 헐리우드 음악을 만들었군요. 컨셉 아트에는 온통 와패니즘에 전혀 공감되지 않는 사이버 펑크(저걸 사이버 펑크라고 표현할 수 있다면) 요소들만 허무하게 채워져 있습니다.
원작의 팬이라면 적든 크든 실망할 수 밖에 없는 작품입니다. 원작의 리메이크는 아니지만 공각 기동대의 영화화는 매트릭스가 훌륭히 해냈죠. 아, 눈 씻고 와야겠습니다. 개봉후 본편을 보고 더 대차게 까야할지 예고편을 본 기억을 지워 버려야 할지 고민입니다.
예고편을 보러 오신분들 중에 원작을 보지 않으신 분이 계시다면 꼭 원작을 보시길 바랍니다. 원작 팬들이 왜 예고편만 보고 혹평을 하는지 아실 수 있어요.

아, 생각할 수록 빡치네. 제목 바꿔라. 원작 모욕하지마.",2016-11-14T14:48:07.000Z,0

What I do care about is the dumbing down of the philosophical aspect of the movie, which looks as though they've taken all the high concept thought provoking exploration of the nature of the self and what it means to be a human and reduced it down to ""One woman's struggle to rediscover her past"".

Dull american psycho-babble, self-help, Opera Winffrey, teen-angst melodrama.

Nice work people.

Still if it can do anything to introduce new audiances to the original Movie, the SAC and the Manga then it's not a bad thing, but for me this will never be ""Ghost in The Shell""",2016-11-14T10:05:59.000Z,0

Sorry, but I'm not buying any of this one the same level as I did the anime (Which I enjoy BTW) something about it comes off feeling strange in a ""Fakey Movie effects"" sort of way. It's missing something, and I don't quite know what that is. But you can feel the difference right away, and not in a good way. I'll get things thrown at me, but I don't like Scarlett Johansson in this role, or situation either. Overall, I think it's a fine application of the rule everyone seems to have forgotten: Never do in Live-Action what you can do in Animation, and never do in Animation what you can do in Live-Action.

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"PLEASE enough about the Asian actress thing. 😑 If you know the original movie, you know Major Kusanagi is drawn with a caucasian appearance, as are MANY main anime characters.  So much anime that is worth remembering has main characters drawn as 'white'.  The artists were Asian and that was their decision with their art.  Please, if you don't know classic Anime then you really shouldn't complain.  Go watch the original 1995 Ghost in the Shell PLEASE.. also Akira, Ninja Scroll, Patlabor, Vampire Hunter D, etc... get educated. ✓
My biggest problem with this movie is the casting.  Scarlett is amazing in her own way but she's no Major.......  This movie doesn't need Scarlett.  It needs a physically perfect, somewhat absent faced SOLDIER.  The reason I watch the original again and again is because the Major kicks so much ass.  It's not her words that make me a fan.  It's her physicality.  Her strength.  Her top of the line BANGIN' Cyborg Body.  How Naive she is...  Scarlett is sultry.  We need a new face with the physicality of Adriana Lima combined with a top olympic athlete.  Such a huge disappointment from a huge fan like me.  😔😔😔
The other thing that scares me is the fact that some scenes in this trailer look almost IDENTICAL to scenes from the original Anime.  If you've seen the real life adaptation of ""Blood, The Last Vampire"" then you'll share with me in my fear of this being a let down...  Trying to replicate the exact Anime in a real life setting is kinda like eating reheated nachos.  It sucks.  Make new story lines and other kick ass settings.  That way we'll have nothing to compare it to.  I hope it's good.  I really do....  But if it sucks, as a huge fan of GITS....  I'll be pissed.  🍀",2016-11-14T08:42:57.000Z,1

This trailer shows that something always changes from one format to the other. Thankfully the question of identity embedded in technology seems to be there. Slow-mo action is getting a bit overused, perhaps it's just the trailer?
I don't like the choice of music - Pet Shop Boys is too familiar and a dull choice, overrated 90's disco garbage. Changing the tempo is just life support to an un-imaginative song. Anime had much more interesting music.",2016-11-14T08:30:38.000Z,0

Which is a whole issue for me, I mean Scarlett Johanson does have a beautiful face/body combo, and always does at least a serviceable job, even if I do feel her acting  somewhat overrated. But my issue with Hollywood, is that Scarlett gets all the good roles, she is everywhere, I mean I like her face, but I want to also see, other female leads, other than her, and I just want to get as far away as possible of the Marvel Cinematic Giant on my other movie escapades, because I'm saturated of it and bringing her familiar face just make it harder. Also I am a men, like every other men I'm fascinated whenever I see women sharing lesbian lip kisses, but as a woman lover and defender, I do feel that it's somewhat degrading for women to kiss for our male eye candy, I hope the lesbian kiss has an actual purpose, but I heavily doubt it. We have so few female led movies and they force lesbian kiss for us males, I want a movie my future girlfriend can see and think this movie was written for her as much as it was for me, I want little girls to have females hero to look up to, which are pure from male sexualization, scampy clotes is acceptable but I do feel innecesary lesbian kisses are female degradation and anti-feminist.

Scarlet isn't the main lead because she is white, it's because she is a brand name and will bring in a larger audience. The anime industry might seem large but it's actually very inclusive to those that have the taste for it. This will bring a new area of fans who like Scarlet, as opposed to an Asian lead who would knot attract the anime fans as, unless your an anime fan, there is little incentive to watch the film. Can't we all just enjoy the fact that there is a GITS live adaption that looks so immersive like this? Stop making it about race and appreciate what the movie does have. Race shouldn't determine a movies quality, the actors performances should. I think Scarlet is a fine actor.",2016-11-14T07:41:28.000Z,32

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"An honest review of this trailer against loving the anime: Johansson playing Motoko is just fine, if you are going to get anal about someone ""white"" playing someone who has a japanese name then go live in Japan. Seriously.
Batou is too short and not muscular enough.
They take the focus off of ""what is the soul"" and focus more on what Motoko is vs the general populace.
Taking scenes from the 1995 film is nice, but loses its impact if you don't take every scene. Take all or take none.
The ""love"" story between Batou and Motoko shouldn't kick in for a long while.
Motoko doesn't start questioning her past for a while.
Don't try to cram 2 seasons and 3 movies into one film.
Still going to watch it though...",2016-11-14T07:20:40.000Z,8

So no, it wouldn't make people not see it just because there's no super well known actress playing Major. Not to mention the fact that a shit ton of people already know about Ghost In The Shell.

These films will always look visually stunning but these ""adaptations"" constantly ruin the originals.

There are strong themes of identity in the original ghost in the shell, questions like  ""what is consciousness?""

Will people buy the DVD and talk about it long after it's out of theaters or will it be just another expensive throwaway blockbuster?

Please name a major Japanese Hollywood actress who could appropriately replace Scarlett in this movie. I am not asking for any Japanese actress, I am looking for one who works in America with Hollywood and is recognizable enough that they would sell the types of tickets that Scarlett can (and often does). 

Don't be mad at Hollywood for going with the best people who will make them money, it's why only a handful of actors get the best roles every year. Look at how many roles Will Smith or Denzel get and compare that/how much money they make to other black actors. Hollywood goes for money.

White people aren't the only great actors. I see there is the argument that Motoko is a cyborg and is ""racially amibuous"" but if she doesn't have a ""race"" (which she does she is modeled to be Japanese since this is in Japan) while would the default race be white? In an Asian country?

In terms of appearance, that's my personal opinion. Scarlet looks the part so it transitions very well for me.

The Great Wall is an example of white washing that I cannot agree with. Seeing Matt Damon in the movie is just jarring and feels like he doesn't belong.

You can't can't deny there is a racial disparity and unequal opportunity in Hollywood. The people involved in this movie and every whitewashed movie always ""make up"" for it by having a ""diverse"" cast. Unfortunately, having the ONE (or two) white character have all the character development and screen time and giving the ethic people the supporting roles, the character development of a rotten potato, a little screen time, and villain roles, it is not real diversity, it's discrimination.

I'm not trying to white guilt or white shame people, but I hope you can empathize with racial typecasting. After about a hundred years of Hollywood, Asian-Americans who are born and raised in America are tired of putting on a fake Asian accent and being a #2.",2016-11-14T01:41:33.000Z,2

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"The focus seems more on the ""intrigue""' where Major come from, what the bad guys know she doesnt about the corporation that made her, etc. The original was more about the soul in a world of machine, the connexion between being, than about the ""intrigue"" itself. It was more a japanese theme, now we are more into typical Hollywood intrigue. Plus, Major was had a ambiguous ethnic look somewhere between Asian and Occidental, but Scarlett is 100% American looking. And Major was androgynous (except for the big boobs), she had strong muscular features in the anime (androgyneity is another strong theme in japanese animations along with occidental/oriental ambiguity), here she is the embodiement of american white feminity (i love Scarlett, but not the right casting)

Honestly, i am afraid Hollywood will lost the ""Ghost"" of this story, it soul, in favor to something more watchable for American public. But its hard to say for sure with a 2 minutes trailer. It could be that they focused on these aspects in the trailer to attract peoples and the film itself will have less white washing and will stay closer to the original spirit than this preview seem to let us know.  

In short, the preview show a superficial recreation of the ""shell"" of the original with cute looking exotic imagery, but not of the ""ghost""",2016-11-14T01:35:53.000Z,0

And from this trailer it looks worse than what I espected.
The last thing that bothered me is the casting choice of Scarlette Johanson, I thing she is a good actrees.
What I don't like is the shitty cgi, the fact that they mixed scene copied 1-to-1 as they were in the anime (why a movie has to looks like an anime?) with the usual stuff from hollywood blockbusters (lesbo kiss? Are you serius?).
From the trailer seems also that they have decide to give a different backstory to the Major Motoko Kusanagi, and it is in my opinion one of the most stupid choice that they could have done.

1.) Yes, this is an adaption from an anime.
2.) Don't worry on weather or not you saw the original, movie adaptions explain the story from beginning to end.

If you want to make an Japanese inspired film just take the general concept and apply it to your culture. This easily could have been done in a future NY with the same cast. The western version of the Ring did it. You don't need to appropriate Japanese culture to make money. 

And for those too stupid to understand why this sucks for Asian Americans. It hurts because we aren't ""cool"" enough to cast for the parts but our ancestry is cherry picked for White Americans to use.",2016-11-13T23:17:40.000Z,0

...What the hell is this? This plays like somebody watched the Mamoru Oshii film once, remembered all the cool action scenes, and completely ignored the strong characterization and intricate storytelling that makes the franchise as a whole so popular.

I don't know why they would give such a boring and generic character arc to a character as potentially interesting as the Major. I don't know what the hell Aramaki is doing standing over somebody with a revolver like some Yakuza hitman. I don't know where the Fuchikoma (or Tachikoma) are. I don't know how Michael Pitt's dialogue at the end is supposed to resemble anything the Laughing Man would ever say. And the actor delivering Batou's lines just sounds bored.

Artistic license is important, and telling new stories is important. But when you can replace the _Ghost in the Shell_ logo with an original title and just market this as an original film, that's a sign that you fucked up. Taking all of the recognizable names and a couple of set-pieces from an existing property and throwing everything else away is not the way to make a good adaptation.",2016-11-13T22:51:52.000Z,252

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"One thing I really liked about the original was that it dealt with very philosophical issues. For example, there was a part where the villain (a very advanced AI) demanded asylum because it was a sentient entity. Somebody barked ""You're not! You're just a self preserving program!"". To which it replied ""By that rationale, I submit that your DNA is nothing more than a self-preserving program"". That made me go ""Oh wow, it has a point!"". It actually made me think whether we are, in essence, just a very advanced computer program, which is a disturbing thought because I've always thought of computer programs as being very ""limited"", whereas I envision us humans as being superior because we have choice and free will to do what we want. But what if that's not the case, and what if the AI is right? That we're just like a computer program, and we don't really have choice or free will, that we're limited by our DNA just like the AI is limited by its programming?
And if the AI is right, then how long before we create an AI that's so advanced that it would become morally unacceptable to simply shut it off because it's just too aware of itself?
I think that was the unique thing about the movie, that it actually made me think. Whereas I can just turn my brain off and enjoy most movies, this one actually made me stop and ponder about, you know, life in general.
I'm not getting that vibe from this movie as of yet. It just feels like a movie where the character has a personal quest, which has been done over and over again in one way or the other.",2016-11-13T20:47:01.000Z,2

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"Idris Alba was cast as Heimdall in Thor. Michael B. Jordan was cast as Johnny Storm. Samuel Jackson was cast as Nick Fury. Lucy Liu was cast as Alex Munday in Charlies Angel's. Shawn and Marlon Wayans played white women in White Chicks.

These are all instances of actors being cast in roles of white characters, or in the case of the last example, portraying the reversal of the controversial ""black face"". There are many more examples to draw from. If you look at any of the other film industries around the world, they mostly cast actors of their respective nationalities. There are more examples of ""white roles"" being portrayed by other nationalities than any others. Trying to create a race based narrative for casting decisions is actually perpetuating the divide, so I say, stop being racist, and encouraging the exclusion of an entire race from a role. Perhaps they simply cast the best person for the role.",2016-11-13T20:46:57.000Z,0

Throughout the entire series emphasis is not on physical but on ""mind state"" of the characters. It's about philosophy, moral, our place in the universe, even religion... It is ment to be universal, not dependent of race, nation, sex or any goddamn stupid thing we waste our time on. It is exalted in a way that we, the humanity, have evolved into higher state of conscience and no longer care about such petty things like race (though new problems arose). That is why i like this series (aside the obvious reasons), it make me think that we are capable of higher things. And then i see animals fighting over race and physical appearance. Just who even cares, that is not the point, it need to ambiguous so why not deviate a little?

I can live with the extremely artificial looking body shell. While she does look naked in the Anime, it's very clear it's not an exact replica due to the absence of genitalia. It's better than her running around with a thermoptic camouflage jacket. The face needs to look right, but the body, in the grand scheme of things doesn't. Perhaps it's to clamp down on out-of-work sexuality. Now while i'm pleased that Batou has his artificial eyes, it's clear they're removable and only augmenting whereas the anime seems to suggest they replaced his eyes.

They do explain some of her origin in one anime movie but this looks like a departure from the anime and I'm not pleased. I understand you can't do everything exact but since they can now with CGI get close to original then they should. I'm ok with Scarlet Johanson as the Major (still wished for a Japanese woman) but Batou and other parts looks nothing like the anime.

But she's a good, well-tested actress. This movie has chance to bring a classic  anime's story to whole sifferent set of people, and it needed a prominent actress to do so.

And being that guy who has all of that behind his shoulders is like being the worst critic for this upcoming adaptation, especially considering the fact that the story needed no adaptatio sincen the 1995 movie in itself is a fricking masterpiece that'll blow you away. I've said to myself that I should try to put off the scepticism till I see it of course because I still kind of had hopes for the adaptation...Buuut that was back when we only had those small teasers, when I saw this trailer I kind of figured out what this actually will be  - a Hollywood action flick with a bland plot that just took some cool concepts from the original story.

He has Batou's physique while shirtless, but just looks overweight with a coat on. Aramaki is supposed to be short, skinny, and non-combative, yet he waves a revolver around like Togusa, who's nowhere to be seen.

It's unsurprising that they took liberties with the fact that people in this world can switch into whatever bodies they want. But when you meld characters with distinctively different personalities like Aramaki and Togusa into something unrecognizable, this movie seems more like a money-grabber than a love letter to fans.",2016-11-13T19:00:49.000Z,0

These western adaptations of eastern anime never work out, but you gotta at least appreciate the effort on display here.  I think this movie has a little too much of that ""summer blockbuster"" feel to it when Ghost in the Shell is supposed to be a deliberate and intelligent story peppered with the occasional grand action scene.  Anyway, it remains to be seen, but I hope this is good.  It looks like it could be.

P.S. I'm not sure if Scarlett Johansson was right for this role.  The Major is supposed to be a very confident and strong person, but Scarlett gives off a stoic and soft demeanor.  Watching the anime, The Major is like the most capable and intelligent operator in Section 9, and instantly gives off a lasting impression being such a well-rounded female lead character.  I fear that aspect of her character is lost in this casting, which is a shame, because Motoko (The Major) is one of the most endearing female characters in anime.",2016-11-13T19:15:20.000Z,0

The major was never hyper concerned with the cliche things like 'Where did I come from?' or 'People are apart from me, because I'm synthetic' nor did she ever say dumb things like ""Maybe next time you can design me better"". She has a real sense of humor about herself and the rest of her team,  she was NOT a broody Mary Sue. GitS isn't about Major Kusanagi it's about the society of future japan, and where things go from black and white to grey, and making her the entire focus of the movie doesn't make any sense.

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"I like how all of these people criticizing Scarlett Johansson as The Major simply don't understand how movies work. 

Hollywood movies are all about making money. It's a business. If you make a movie based off of an anime film which isn't very well known in the U.S., use Japanese actors and actresses who aren't very well known, and expect the movie to make money, you're going to have a bad time.

Ghost in the Shell isn't Star Wars. You can't throw in actors that no one knows and get people to see it based off of the name alone. So, the only other thing you can do to get people to take notice of the film is to hire an A-list actress to take on the main role. Scarlett Johansson is the reason people who don't know what Ghost in the Shell is will see this movie. She's proven she can take on badass female leads, which The Major definitely is. 

Besides, what makes The Major Japanese, aside from her name (Motoko Kusanagi)? She's a cyborg. She could have looked like anyone, of any ethnicity. In the original movie, she doesn't even look particularly Japanese. And her ethnicity, realistically, is irrelevant to the plot of the original movie. The movie could have taken place in any major city of the world, as long as the themes of identity and human interaction with technology were still present.

So, to everyone claiming whitewashing and all that bullshit, do some research into how Hollywood operates and stop spouting your idiocy. If there was an A-list Japanese actress who was ignored for Johansson, then you would have a point, but that's simply not the case.",2016-11-13T18:01:53.000Z,4

It looks as if they are leaning more to the cold tone of the movies that Mamoru Oshii directed. The story seems to deal with the Major's pass, and it sounds like they want to go a different way than the series, which had her go suggested she went cyborg as a little girl. It might work after all Ghost in Shell often worked pest with heavy questions and it seems this movie might have them. It seems from the trailer that she doesn't truly know who she is and feels as if there is something is missing. As if the connections others have she lack. It all sound vary interesting to me.

""In the not so distant future, when the corporate networks fill the Earth with electronic and optical communication lines, but society has not yet been too computerized to erase nations and races...""

Anyone who says the characters' races don't matter cause their cyborgs wasn't paying attention to all the political subtext and commentary in SAC series. 

Finally they are episodes in ghost in the shell where they meet  Caucasian  Americans and they look different from Motoko.  This proves at the VERY LEAST she isn't Caucasian.

""But but, scarlett johansson is a box office success thats why she was casted""

WRONG, the producers wanted Margot Robbie but she was filming tarzan and was booked with suicide squad. 

""She wasn't white in the anime""

Actually she was, and in Arise you can very briefly see her parents. 

""WHAT difference does it make""

well she works for a Top Secret Japanese Government agency,  Walking around looking like a Caucasian american women isn't the best disguise.   

""But Japan makes our movies with ALL JAPANESE CAST, Are they racist!""

Well I can't speak for japan, but in here in the U.S. we are a melting pot. We have the most diverse country on earth and movies sometimes and SHOULD show that.

Although Kusanagi was always aware of her lack of a past, that was never a focus for her character or the story.

Her plight is in finding her identity but because she never had a body to begin with, she has always been a consciousness inside of a machine.

and they not play smart and change the character drasticaly like dragonball evo
even the city vibe, they capture it in this one

i dont think make the protagonist asian will make it better
if the protagonist are asian who gonna watch it? just asian? 

it just weebs that only judge by ""the character voice actor"" , ""the character race"" , "" if it doest speak japanese then its bad""

at least this movie adaptation was on the track, they following the original

the original character doesnt even look like japanese (ever see japanese having purple or blue iris?)
its not like goku that have heavy japanese look

instead if you make all the character japanese, it be like cheap japanese drama with cheap effect stereotype film
,asian vfx are too noticeable and its like sticker, and im definitely wont watch it

and i never see japanese actress that perfect for this role and there some language barrier too

use japanese and there like just only asian that watch asian stuff, bad decision ever

(many people are watch this film and never watch the OVA, they dont even care it talk japanese or english, soo chill out and enjoy the film )",2016-11-13T17:16:40.000Z,0

Listen, I acknowledge that there’s a huge lack of Asian representation in Hollywood but this isn’t the movie to scream “whitewashing” about. Hollywood is a business, and they need to make a profit. Ghost In the Shell is a FRINGE anime whose core fanbase is not big enough to justify the multi-million dollar budget this film has. The studio had to hire an A-List star to draw in the general public, people who never heard of anime in their entire life. 

We can’t have it both ways. Either they cast an unknown Asian actor and create a low budget indie movie (which would be horrible for this particular franchise) or cast a movie star and give this adaptation the budget it deserves. The latter option is a win/win for fans and the movie studio, who need a return on their investment. 

We need to hold Hollywood accountable for not casting Asian actors in everyday tv shows and movies. Raise your voice and speak up for Asians not being in sitcoms and primetime dramas or movies without anything to do with sci-fi or fantasy. That’s when true change will happen.",2016-11-13T16:39:09.000Z,0

I mean I have nothing against Scarlett Johansson she is a great actress but having white American actors and actresses fill in for Asian roles is unacceptable. Hollywood should have Asians actors and actresses do their part in these types of movies. Ghost in the Shell started in Japan, I've been a fan of the show for a long time and at least have a Japanese actress do the role like Rinko Kikuchi, Karen Fukuhara, or any other Asian actresses who would be interested to take the role.

Damn, this trailer is worth nothing but Pukes and Shits. Most of the iconic scenes from original Ghost in the Shell Movie (1995) and its sequel 'Innocence' (2004) can be literally seen getting ruined in this trailer.

What the crap CG effects? Major Motoko Kusangi's body suit doesn't look like this shitty white paint suit at all. Heck in original animated movie version she is even seen in transparent body armor while using tactical camouflage ability to get invisible. Batou, the most trusted guy in her team who is badass originally and is also ex-ranger looks jackass clown in this trailer (1:29).

ScarJo looks good but doesn't sound good, batou looks rediculous and in general I feel like they might have strayed really far from the source material to make it this westernized action movie.

I can tell you that this movie, if the trailers show where the movie's direction is going, it completely wrong. They are emphasizing the android bodies, which is in original film is not even an important part of the film. body enhancements are the normal. In fact, Togusa only has a memory upgrade and the rest of him is mostly human which leaves the rest of the team impressed and slightly bitter that he is able to keep up with the team without enhancements.

The main focus of the movie is when the a human not longer a human but something else. that is the real heart of the original film. in addition, it looks like this film is combining both Ghost in the Shell and Innocence and both of those movies have different topics. 

my advice to anyone interested in this film, go watch the original animated films ghost in the shell and Innocence and just skip this.",2016-11-13T16:07:27.000Z,0

The Major is completely cybernetic, meaning that she could have any race and any appearance that the writer chose. 

Additionally, her appearance has basically been completely ethnically ambiguous/neutral throughout the franchise and each iteration. The writer could have omitted the name ""Mokoto"" and simply call her ""the Major"" as most people in the series already do.

And there is nothing inherently Japanese about the themes and the story except that it takes place in Japan, and that it has Japanese people. But the story could take place literally anywhere with a city setting and the story would remain practically the same.",2016-11-13T16:06:51.000Z,0

It does not seem CYBERPUNK as much.. just kinda looks like a modern city with unnecessarily large holograms  with couple random avant garde fashion people in the streets or something. Seriously they just took a video of today's everyday streets and just threw in some floating koi fish and thats it. I expected more dystopian cyberpunk city in a night setting and more mechs with hundreds of different immaculately moving parts. And more WIRES, TONS and TONS of looping and spiraling wires connected to body parts which pretty much defines the gritty look of ghost in the shell. They did have little bit of that with the monks at the end but WTF? Just ONE wire for each person? There should be at least 10 wires or something. Man, that just looks shallow. It doesnt even have a spider tank probably because CG team could not dare to manage it. They really did not make this look good even with the original that had amazing visuals to use as reference. 
I said scarlet johansson looked good for the Kusanagi role but when she said ""maybe next time you can design me better"", her delivery was very weak. Kusanagi Motoko is very strong character and stern soldier. I can think of several better way of her saying something like that. She is also capable of extremely sophisticated acrobatic moves(cyborg and all) but all you really get in this video is typical asf slow motion wall running.. She also looks like shes just wearing a nylon tights btw.
Why remake a 3D movie out of it if 2D original looks so much better? All their selling point in this video is pretty much straight from the original anyway(geisha robots, building dive, invisible fist fight on a water)

2016-11-13T10:47:41.000Z,G4VmJcZR0Yg,Ghost in the Shell Official Trailer 1 (2017) - Scarlett Johansson Movie,"I watch this with a mixture of excitement and disgust. 

Excitement because a few things here really look promising. But a lot of it may be just the GITS fanboy inside of me. And the producers should be very aware of the fact that, using so much original material (scenery/story) will inevitably make people compare. And if your movie looks worse than what was produced 1995, you know you're not doing it right, right?
So I feel disgust because they handled a lot of the sourcematerial worse than the anime movies/series. And with the animes handrendering technics, especially of the first movie, they had it a lot harder to control the visuals then the CGI nowadays. Yet composition and detail looks partially worse than in 1995.
And I am also worried. They seem to try to cramp far too much material into one story, which was used for many different storylines over years, instead of focusing more of their energy into less, to creat truly perfect scenery and story. I'd rather watch a shorter good movie than a longer worse one. Lets see how this all turns out. But I would keep my hopes low, to not suffer even more dissapointment.

Some feelings I felt while watching:
1. Major leaps from the tower (yes yes yes!!), breaks the window and jumps into the room (wait what?!). Really really hope these where footage from 2 different scenes. 
2. CGI and movement of the major are lacking the grace, beauty and fluidity. This is an action SciFi, please use budget where it matters.
3. From a realistic perspective, Robo-Geishas should be stunningly beautiful, but they made them just look like cool robots, defeating the purpose of them being Gaishas in the first place. From an artistic standpoint, the contrast between the beauty of traditional Geishas and the technical, cold complexity of advanced machinery is what makes Robo-Geishas so great in my eyes.
4. The scenery of the normal streets lack the overcrowded details of the original, makes the scenery feel somewhat empty for me.
5. They tryed to use the color scemes in the originals as guides, but in the scenes they fail to replicate it, it really stands out.",2016-11-13T15:46:58.000Z,0

At least that's my understanding of the original, though I haven't seen it in years. The rest looks ok, guess we'll just have to wait and see. (And what the hell is up with her constantly stripping?

I understand the frustration, this is in Japan and the original is an anime.  You have to realize however, that Hollywood is a business first and foremost, and directors and production companies would like to obtain a benefit as much as possible out of their projects.  Scarlet is the highest paid female actress and the producers know this will add value and status to the movie, therefore bringing more tickets to the theaters.

Scarlett is good for this movie because she's a big name actress and is good for advertising, but she doesn't exactly have the right build.

HE LOOKS LIKE A BAD COSPLAY!But, yeah, Scarlet is a terrible choice for the character, for a variety of reasons besides just not being Asian.Her and the director of the film don't really seem to get the character, one of the other teasers showed her shaking in fear quite noticeably while aiming a pistol, which doesn't really fit the character's rather stoic reactions to dangerous situations, nor does she have the significant uncanny valley effect present in the oshii film this adaption seems to be mostly basing itself on, trading creepy, doll like eyes with a permanant thousand yard stare for that thing Scarlet frequently does where her eyes are looking slightly away from each other.She also has a completely different look from the character, major in the mango and anime had more of an 80's female bodybuilder physique, with the excessive tan being absent in the anime, Scarlet on the other hand is just built like a fairly average woman, which along with losing floofy hair for what looks like a bad wig cut up by a five year old, and the camo suit having a completely generic design which loses the skin tight, vacuum fitted latex look of the original to cater to the average American's irrational fear of nipples, makes the character design look far, far worse, it loses everything that made the original unique and memorable....and she's not Asian.

HOWEVER this is not a biography film, this is a fictional film and you people are angry not because of whitewashing but because Hollywood had the chance to create new fame and fortune for the latest Asian American movie star of what many of you feel is a highly underrepresented group in America but instead Hollywood played it too safe and wanted Scarlet, not because she was white but because she was famous and would guarantee the movie a lot of money.

Scarlett Johansson isn't a talented actress. She plays the same character in all her action movies without even a slight nuance. So if anyone wants me to believe the producers were just prioritizing talent over race, all I can do is laugh. There are 7 billion people on this planet. It is a racist suggestion that there aren't incredibly talented actors and actresses of every race and it's insulting to my intelligence if you expect me to believe the only motivation here isn't money. They just want to trade in on Johansson's fame, despite the fact that numerous actors of color have demonstrated that they can play leads in films that go on to be wildly profitable.

And it just adds insult to injury that she's not even a good actress. Is there a single credible reason why someone like Rinko Kikuchi couldn't play Kusanagi?",2016-11-13T15:06:02.000Z,4

However I still get this weird vibe from Scarlett's acting. Not in a ""OMG they should've cast an asian actor OMG"" rage fit, I'm trying to move away from that so I can more fairly judge this movie. It feels a little awkward, like they could've placed slightly more humanity behind her words. I get it, she's a robot, but even in the manga and anime the Major had at least a little sense of humor despite the fact she never even blinked. However if they can pull of the ""emotionless girl"" trope with Scarlett like they've done in the past then all the more power to them.",2016-11-13T15:02:18.000Z,0

Most of the main characters don't look Asian, mind you there are some that do in the original animated film but the Major and Bato are not them, the look very Caucasian. I really don't understand why people are accusing this film of ""white washing"" when it's not there. I really hope that this film is a success and that it introduces more people to the awesome and cool story that is ""Ghost in the Shell"".

I know fans such as myself want this film adaptation of Ghost in the Shell to have the same look and feel of the original animated film, judging from the trailer it does a very good job. I really don't want this movie to end up like Dragonball: Evolution, that movie was just a mess and was not a good experience, and I don't think this film will end up in such an abysmal failure like that movie did.",2016-11-13T14:49:04.000Z,8

... seriously? They use ""Major"" as if it were an actual *name*? Presumably to tiptoe around the problematic question of why a woman with a distinctly Japanese name would look like Scarlett Johansson? 
That's completely idiotic. If the first line in a movie trailer is *that* stupid, I'm certainly not likely to be won over. 

Now go and gush over Scarlett Johansson as if her ""acting"" in these scenes could not have been done by just about any other young actress on the planet - or the about the visual effects as if there was still anything amazing about visual effects in 2016.",2016-11-13T14:25:13.000Z,1

As far as the plot goes, I think they made a huge mistake.

The major's backstory is not a Robocop style: ""you were dying so we saved you by making you a robot.""  This story takes place in a time where people are VOLUNTARILY cyberizing themselves.  Instead of dealing with the deep cultural and moral themes from GITS, they turned it into another ""help they made me a robot"" story.  No thanks.

Some people think they are 'betraying' the source material to like something like this, but I don't see how anyone can ignore the fact that this looks visually stunning, and from what little we've seen of the characters so far I can't really make a good or bad judgement.

However, by only casting the lead in this way, film companies can create their larger audience while allowing the other actors get better known, upping their chances of being in more productions themselves and getting to that internationally famous status.

I think this RE-MOVIE will trip on it's own HYPE and here's why, the OG-MOVIE of this RE-MOVIE was really really really really GOOD THE END. But no seriously they might mess this RE-MOVIE up by making it a """"""soapy"""""" """"""oranges story"""""",  boring """"""CSI mystery story"""""" and have CG special effects that have no impact or emotion at all. So what i'm saying is this RE-MOVIE could be tone death and suck? ya really suck. The OG-MOVIE was not an oranges story, it was a window to the way the world was, it was not soapy it was raw and lived in, it did have a little boring side but it's OK for exposition to be a little boring, and the CG/cell animation was good because all of it was done by professionals that where directed and or by guy's that made this stuff all by hand back in the day.

just by watching the trailer, i'm impressed.GitS was pretty much the first real anime movie i ever watched like 15 or 16 years ago and i've been a fan ever since, but i don't understand all the butthurt going on over the major not being asian etc etc.

Когда героиня майор Кусанаги борется один на один с роботом-танком на фоне дерева эволюции, мы на самом деле наблюдаем как борятся две ветки эволюции машин.

Also, while I don't know how this is going to turn out, I really wish Hollywood would at least try to keep the theme of the source material, even if they need to change some parts for multiple audiences.

I think the issues present in the GitS franchise are becoming more and more relevant to the collective thought and conversation, now that technologies that were until now seen as ""future technology"", such as robotic limbs and more complex AI are being developed. I think that the choice of lead actress is just better fit for this purpose of injecting these ideas for rumination and conversation in the western world. 

Still, I think it's a shame that this movie was not made with an Asian lead actress, keeping to the original story and setting. However, I think the creator of GitS was aware of this live action movie's purpose of injecting these ideas into the mainstream when he said that he does not care about the choice of Caucasian lead actress.",2016-11-13T13:00:48.000Z,1

I really wanted to see the Japanese woman from Pacific Rim play the lead role here.  Should have been all Japanese cast with Japanese language like the anime. I love watching anime with English subtitles it's how it is meant to be watched god damn it.  This is soooooooooooooo disappointing no matter how visually beautiful the movie is.  This movie would have been received 10x better if they used a Japanese cast.  I would have gone to see this in the movie theater especially if it was Japanese language with English subtitles (a true foreign film).  Instead I'll wait until it's available from Redbox or Netflix. Nothing against Scarlett Johanson she is a good actress but she's not Japanese.,2016-11-13T12:57:59.000Z,0

To all the haters complaining out there that it's not Japanese or there's no nipples etc. you have to remember that a film like this requires a massive budget and in order to get the Hollywood execs on board it needs to be in English with a recognisable actress to reach a broader audience to justify the cost.

Seriously I expected a worse type of thing but WOW THIS LOOKS GOOD! Now obviously this is just a trailer therefore all the people who liked the trailer and is ready to pre-order the tickets for the movie I say we all have to calm down and get ready for whatever that could be wrong.....

Though the last movie that I awaited this much which was Warcraft was AMAZING (but its Blizzard we talking about so we cant expect anything less) there were movies which may have been declared to be bad already (the Dawn of Justice and the new Ghostbusters for example) and there were movies which were anticipated but many got out of the cinemas with bad experience (many for example didn't liked the new X-Men movie and the Suicide Squad) BUT! as I said we got tons and TONS of good movies as well which were anticipated and basically kicked the expectations to higher and then they delievered it (like Star Wars, Deadpool, Captain Murica 2, Warcraft,)

So I say for the fact that the sea of the movies has been really dangerous at these times (for we don't know and we can't just decide things from trailers that the movie will be good or not because it can suprise us both in the good and the bad way) Therefore I say that okay the trailer looks amazing and I guess I'm gonna rewatch it a couple of time because I AWAIT THIS MOVIE! and I really really REALLY! hope that the movie will be as awesome as probably many of us expect it to be

The issue with live-action movies based on anime is that usually the japanese studios don't have a big budget, so the CGI ends up sloppy-looking, and not enough money and time goes into casting and writing as it should. So Hollywood, with a much bigger budget, can improve on some of these issues. For example, the CGI looks beautiful in this trailer, (which is important in a cyber-punk world like GiTS's) and I, personally, like Scarlett's performance until now (as a side note, it can't be considered white-washing if the character isn't even Japanese in the first place). Don't get me wrong though. These are all PERSONAL OPINIONS based on solely THE TRAILER. So, the movie can still be crap. But I won't call it shit just now. I'll wait and see. I'll actually watch the movie before judging it. (excuse my english, it's not my native language)",2016-11-13T12:48:03.000Z,0

While some scenes are taken from the animation such as the water scene it seems that they made up own stuff a bit too much. (be advised I have not yet seen the complete series) As I recall Major was nothing fancy as 'The first' that would indicate she is the chosen one but she was simply one of many who developed to become more of a philosopher. 

The invisibility was nothing built in to her body which seems to be the case in this trailer but rather a technology using a specific type of cloth. The Major and Batou had a long relationship even at the start of the animation and that is why they has such trust in each other in the trailer it is indicated that Batou is newly created. 

This movie would do good to copy as much as possible from the animation not go their own way with things. Well I do hope it will be good anyway but probably not as I had hoped.",2016-11-13T12:47:57.000Z,0

Whoever thought that nude suit was a good look should be strangled to death by a self-aware robo geisha. There are bits and pieces I recognize from the various GITS Movies, TV Series, and manga, so I guess the story will be a compilation of scenes from all works spliced together into a convoluted mess of a white-washed story. Even if I didn't care about the white-washing, Scarlett Johansson is a pretty abysmal actress. I would say she just lacks range, but even the one character she does play in every film she has ever been in is wooden and devoid of personality. And that Batou.... :(",2016-11-13T12:45:44.000Z,7

Next thing is having Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira as a westernized version. Does any other Anime fan mind watching sub titles while having the movie in its original language? What happened to diversity? Did it die because the projected viewer base didn't come back as strong? I like diving into other countries lore/ imaginations with no need of seeing a familiar face, especially as stereotypical as Scarlet and Waltz.

And why did they went full nude and lesbian on top? Even the hooker cyborgs weren't nude.

I have read the manga, watched the films, watched Stand Alone Complex, watched ARISE, etc. I have seen and read pretty much every major media around the Ghost in the Shell franchise. 

This movie, to me, looks fantastic. Not only is the tone down very well, but the main part of the GitS Franchise is the philosophies and themes of ""Identity"". Even if you don't notices it right away, every character, plotline, and story involved with the series is connected to Identity. Not just of the Major herself, but also of the people she comes across and knows. This movie looks to be following those themes very well, and I can't wait to see what's in store.",2016-11-13T12:37:32.000Z,0

Parts of it looks like an amazing shot for shot live-action remake of the original anime, but other parts look like they didn't really use the original story about the puppet master. And in my experience, when film-makers try to adapt a popular franchise but then don't use the original story because they are desperate to make it ""their own"", that backfires in 10 out of 10 cases. That's why most movies based on video games fail: they don't use the original story from the games and instead write a shitty new story, not realising that most of the fanbase of the source material are fans BECAUSE of the original story.",2016-11-13T12:35:17.000Z,2

Adaptions are never going to be spot on, Hollywood will never adapt anything right. Whether it's a book, anime or comic.
They will never give a shit about the lore, they will never give a shit about the fans.
What they want, is the masses. The standard consumer.
I already knew the day they announced they were gonna make a GiTS adaption, that it'd be shite.
BUT
I'm gonna watch it, I'm not gonna watch it as a GiTS movie. I'm gonna watch it as a cyberpunk movie that lends from the GiTS universe. If you want to enjoy this movie or any adaption that comes out of Hollywood, I'd suggest you'd do the same. Otherwise you're just setting yourself up for disappointment, because lets be real here, you shouldn't expect anything nowadays.

In the original manga upon which the movie and all other subsequent versions are based, Motoko/The Major is stated as preferring European (i.e. Caucasian) bodies. This is a fact backed up by Shirow Masamune, The Series Creator, in the appendices of said manga and multiple interviews. So this isn't just a case of her being drawn to look European due to some artistic stylization and giving her a mukokuseki (stateless) appearance that is popular in manga and anime. It's due to The Major herself being mukokuseki/stateless. This is coming from someone who has had Ming Na Wen cast as The Major since 1997 or 98. Scarlet isn't my first choice, but I think she's a good choice and will play her well.",2016-11-13T12:10:41.000Z,0

I'm honestly not sure they could have made that movie even further from the actual plot of the original comics, movies, and tv series'.  Kusanagi has always known her past.  Yes, she doubted it a little once, in one scene, in the first movie, but she still knew who she was, past or no past.  And her being the first?  That takes away from the entire plot point of her being generic and using a common body for her own.  It's her doubting her identity because so many others have the same external shells.  In the series this was updated to her having a specifically important watch because it was an external memory device; something she comments that many cyborgs rely on.

And the soundtrack is miserable.  Couldn't they get Kenji Kawai to work on it to make it as amazing as the original?  Talk about trying to make a pale image through a cloudy mirror and selling it to the blind.",2016-11-13T12:09:14.000Z,1

Will it be better that the original 95 movie probably not. It looks very inconsistent with the source material (and I have no idea why since it was already a master piece) and that will most likely prove its dislike among original fans such as myself and even other anime lovers but like I said if anything it should at least be entertaining. 

Its funny I had an argument with someone a while back when the first really short trailer came out and he argued that it was based off of stand alone complex but its clearly more structured around the 95 movie. I highly recommend watching the original as I think it will prove much more than this but meh do what you please.",2016-11-13T11:25:00.000Z,0
