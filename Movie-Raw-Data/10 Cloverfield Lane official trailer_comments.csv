There are SO few movies these days that are genuinely scary and this was one of the scariest I've seen in a long time. It's not even ""horror"" in the basic sense, definitely more of a suspense/thriller but very good. I mean to have a good plot and storyline is an achievement in itself these days. I personally think what makes it so scary is the whole ""what if"" part of your brain being triggered. Everyone has their own opinion of course but to be completely honest I made the mistake of watching it alone at night and I'm a 30 year old man who loves scary movies but this definitely had me a little shook lol Like I said highly recommend it to anyone especially a fall night with a date 😉",2018-10-09T16:30:05.000Z,1

While the ending would have probably been fine in any kind of action schlock flick, this one was more of a thriller, and that ending seemed so tacked on...  If she got outside, and looked and said ""Oh, come on..."" and then it cut to credits, oh man...  That would have worked SO well.  What a cliff hanger!

But no, we had to get some action movie cliche crap at the very end.  Ultimately, it's a minor ding on an otherwise fantastic movie that was genuinely tense and reaffirms that John Goodman can play a supremely scary guy who doesn't need to scream and yell, but just be overwhelmingly intimidating with just a look and a calm, yet stern tone of voice that just makes you shiver.

Very claustrophobic, very moody...  Absolutely fantastic.  Just hit stop when she says ""Oh come on"" and you'll have a winner.",2018-01-17T01:15:59.000Z,1

It was always about the aliens but you get so wrapped up in the thrill ride that you forget! It was a Sci-Fi movie in disguise. Throughout the entire movie there are huge hints that there might be aliens out there. When Howard was talking about possible alien invasion and when Emmett states that what he seen looked like something from the bible. When I seen the aliens at the end I got exactly what I wanted and expected at first to see but thought wasn't going to happen because of the way the movie was being told.I also got what I wasn't expecting which was the thrill ride.

I have something to tell, cause I can't be silent I even could not imagine how truly John Goodman was the American character to me in this film. The thing is that I visited the US when I was an exchange student and I happened to live with such a guy like John goodman's character. First he seemed very nice but then in time when I watched how he threatened me and others I found out that he was too cared for what I was doing, every move, had stern and unbeatable principals and I almost had nothing to debate on. He was exactly the way John Goodman played in the movie, I still simply wonder how far, he was very big and fat, looking rough, always smiled but I felt some constant hidden danger in his little kinky eyes, somehow intuitively. Of course, I was not locked in a house like that girl in a movie, but you must understand thst I was in a foreign country and had no other place to go than just stay in his house. When I recollect this memory that makes me feel alike the main character. Later, I found out that that man was in a prison before, because he let a foreign boy stayed with him and the boy claimed to police about his sexual harassment. But he tried to calm down me cause all this was in the past and he still stays under the police check and can't move to any other state. Sure nothing bad happened though he sometimes let himself to curse me pretending on his was joking. In the end of season I returned to my homecountry. The memories of it always comes with different emotions. Sometimes I feel hysterically unpleasant like if I was a little child to care about. I shared all this with you because I wanted to express myself and to know you how unbelievably true John Goodman was in his image, this character now associates me with an American type of men when I think of Americans.",2016-12-08T02:42:01.000Z,3

I wanted to see whats so good about it based reviews here.I thought it would have a good story until she came outside from that basement.Just the idea that aliens invaded the wold the same day that she had car accident is too coincidental and not great story. Then when she killed an alien I thought OMG can this get any worse. Horible movie and producet too.

I think that all of the mess in there would've never happened if Howard didn't enrage about every single thing and instead of putting others in fear he should have been way more chill and explain more. Because he left so much bullshit to explore for others and said lies + violence and not cooperating with others he fucked up really bad. If I were him I would've let the lady explore with the suit and see the results and then think what to do.

She felt dumb and betrayed and lied to. She sits down in the man's car when she tries to start the car it doesn't work. She gets irretated (sorry for my bad english, im actually norwegian) and hits the drawer thingy in the car where you can put stuff. A picture comes out; A family picture of a blonde woman (which you could see earlier in the movie, when she was infected or whatever) a picture of the man in the movie (cant remember the name haha) and a girl (the one the man showed a picture of, and called her his daughter) And then a flashback comes on: The man and woman actually had kidnapped this girl, and gave her a new name (the name the man said his daughter was called). He loved this girl, and never wanted to lose her. The woman (his wife) got annoyed that the man was so in love with the daughter, that she wanted to kill the girl. The man got mad when he found out so he threw the wife out of the hut/house. The girl (the kidnapped one) was terrified of him, she tried to escape.. When she tried to escape ( by going where michelle found the girls earring ) the man found out and put poison gas in the hole thingy that lead to the girl, before the girl passed out, she used her earring to write HELP on top of the glass thingy (where michelle found that it said help) and then she passed out, and her earring fell on the floor (and then Michelle found it) the man used the poison liquid to get rid of the girls body. FLASHBACK IS OVER. Michelle got confused by the photo, but she kept it in her suit. She got out for the car (since it didnt work) and looked up in the sky. She saw a green gas coming towords here. aaaand the movie ended. So ur probs like; so where did the gas come from? Thats what the viewers have to think about, how could the gas just go away, and then appear? as I said, the people who see the movie have to think about that. What I really didnt like about the movie was that it didnt come show anything about the girl on the photo a.k.a the ''daughter'', and I didnt like that the aliens and ufo just appeared. I am so sorry for my bad english, but I hope u understood. oh and btw since the man threw his wife out, the wife probs wanted to visit him or something, and then the green air appeard, and she got killed. Thats one of the reasons the man didnt want her to get in the hut (THIS IS THE REASON ABOUT THE BLONDE WOMAN IN _MY_ ENDING, NOT THE MOVIE ENDING) Tell me what you thought about this ending that i wrote :)",2016-08-03T19:01:28.000Z,0

It has a lot of things going for it, including phenomenal acting job, suspensful and claustrophobic atmosphere, you could really cut tension in the air with scissors, characters are greatly developed, they felt human and main protagonist of the story represented us as an audience when she asked all the right questions. But the movie has flaws and obvious far fetched story including plot holes, cheap 80's horror resolution of the bunker story and preposterous end which will sure make people roll their eyes.

The ending had the beginning of a cool movie. I give it 5 plus out of ten. Sure the movie had you wondering if he was just a serial killer only they stepped over the mark by shooting the guy. That made him a killer and ruined plausability in my mind that he could have just be right abkut the alien invasion and nothing else. Yep only 5 plus.,2016-07-12T21:13:50.000Z,0

Am I the only one who hates these films with aliens and/or an apocalyptic theme? I thought it was an okay storyline. I enjoyed all the tension, suspense and mystery, but i'm really not a fan of these type of endings. I thought there were WAY too many cliches at the end. Once she saw the aliens, I predicted what was going to happen. A really typical ending. And come on, why were the aliens presented as some kind of morons who had just 'inherited' all those capabilities and technological powers a mere 24 hours ago. Really? They couldn't catch a slow ass woman? They were easily tricked? That huge ass alien or whatever it was died from a simple molotov?  

Don't get me wrong, of course movies are going to be different. But the way this movie played out, with the characters and their mysteriousness, the mystery of the story in general, the woman who appeared to have been 'infected' etc, this could have ended very differently. For example, what if Howard had really kidnapped her? That would have worked well with what Michelle found out about 'Megan'. We never even got to even know the truth about who is daughter is, who the woman he kidnapped REALLY is, why he did it etc. I guess that adds more to the mystery and suspense, and ultimately remains unsolvable, which some would prefer. Furthermore, what if Emmett was in on it as well? That he was conspiring with Howard on the kidnappings? OR, what if the woman who appeared to be infected was really Howard's wife and that whole scene was deliberately staged so that Michelle remains scared and convinced that the air is really polluted and therefore decides to remain in the bunker? Wouldn't that have worked better? We never got to know why she appeared to look infected either. Oh well. I guess I would have preferred a classic film with a psycho kidnapped, and some kind of twist at the end (such as Ben paying Howard to kidnap her, and why) where it's not based on anything to do with aliens or apocalypse.",2016-07-09T16:14:55.000Z,0

This movie is about domestic abuse. From Howard's first moments with Michelle he is more worried about controlling her than comforting her or understanding what's going on in her head. He threatens her with violence when she disobeys he's arbitrary rules. Then seems surprised moments later when he's upset. He terrifies her than blames her for hurting his feelings by not showing him enough gratitude and respect. When she finally escapes she finds new threats waiting, hence the abuse metaphor. That for victims of domestic abuse, getting out of the house doesn't immediately solve their problems. For a moment when Michelle first removes her mask, and learned that Howard was wrong about the poisonous air it seems like the movie and my and honor know of relief in the promise of her problems are over. But they are not. That's the primary reason for the big direct confrontation at the end.",2016-07-09T04:03:09.000Z,0

It was in keeping with the movie's themes and ideas, particularly in how it's sort of an analysis and metaphor for domestic abuse.  Simply escaping the bunker wasn't enough.  We had to see her actually assert power through defeating the alien threat and face it head on when she leaves to help in Houston to know that she has truly become a stronger person and moved past that fear to become someobe who will confront the issues at hand without just running away.  If it just ended with her escaping, it would have felt like a shallow ending...  with her just being the same person she was right back at the beginning when she was fleeing her boyfriend, inevitably to get sucked back into a cycle of abuse somewhere down the road.",2016-06-18T14:16:52.000Z,230

It ties in perfectly with the theme of its original film, suggesting further alien attacks. 
Also, it was declared that this was going to be a spiritual successor and not a literal sequel to the original Cloverfield.
Blaming it for not being is like blaming children's cartoons for not being realistic - it simply doesn't aim to.

The acting, cinematography, pacing, and mostly - soundtrack was really top notch. Although some scenes felt as dragged on or contained flawed logic, overall it was one the more enjoying films I've seen to date.",2016-06-17T19:33:14.000Z,0

Next scene, the plane is flying and a large ball of white light is close to the plane, and suddenly, after a flash of bright light, a bizarre-looking creature is on the plane in the aisle.  The Marshall jumps up and starts shooting at the creature which is giving this horrendous screeching noise; end of preview.  I haven't been able to find that clip since, so I can only guess I was misdirected to a preview of a different movie, and not 10 Cloverfield.  Anyone know the movie?  Because I would rather watch THAT flick than watch 10 Cloverfield Lane, although it's now too late and that's almost two hours of my life I can't get back.  I know, just my own opinion and all that, but this sequel that's not a sequel (?) didn't measure up; please understand, I loved the original and most of Abrams movies, in fact. But for the first hour and 25 minutes of this movie, almost the entire movie, our heroine is locked in a cellar with two guys, and there's a lot of emotional buildup, etc., but that's it.  I thought I was watching a Cloverfield movie.  Quite disappointed.",2016-06-05T16:50:35.000Z,0

in this movie the cloverfield 1 and the cloverfield lane is the same event... but two stories, while the monsters attacking the new York city in part 1  these three people was hiding in the underground shelter and at the ending of the cloverfield lane movie the girl didn't believe Howard she thought he was psycho killer. but Howard was really a scientist in this movie and he was preparing something and it actually happened. 
so, the girl was alive and that was maybe the aftermath of the part 1 cloverfield movie. that the event has done but the aliens are still there and later she killed the mother alien in a spaceship. there was an easter eggs in this movie in the end when the girl was heading to another town there was a lightning and you can see the shadow of a big spaceship looks like the spaceship in the independent movie today cause JJ Abraham's is also the director. bye",2016-05-21T18:47:10.000Z,0

It's the story of a woman who wakes up in a room underground after a car accident and is told by a farmer that he has saved her from the world outside which he says is uninhabitable . The question is , is he lying and does he have an ulterior motive for keeping her captive?
This is a spin off from the 2008 film Cloverfield ( which I loved) but it's hard to say why without giving it away.
John Goodman is fantastic as Howard and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is pretty convincing too. Director Dan Trachtenberg did a really good job with this considering it was his debut feature. 
I really enjoyed this and hopefully we will see more Cloverfield hybrid's in the future.my rating - 8 out of 10",2016-05-21T10:22:44.000Z,0

The first event takes place during ""The Purge"". All of the humans still have the ""24 hour legal crime"" thing. It takes place in the future. During the fifteenth hour of one of the purges, a factory releases toxic poison, which starts spreading all over the country. The next event would be ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (it might be a prequel: you'll here why). Three people (Emmett, Michelle, Howard) are stuck in a bunker during the Purge for safety. Howard starts releasing toxic chemicals as well and Emmett and Michelle must escape. Emmett does not make it but Michelle does and leaves. Leslie was dying from poison in her lungs.The next event is ""Cloverfield"". After all of these events, the Purge is either cancelled or permanently gone (idk what the third movie will have). All of the chemicals were thought to be gone, but most of it rose up to space, which attracted aliens who came to earth at the end of Cloverfield.

I just watched this movie today. I have to say the whole movie of them 3 in the bunker was really good and thrilling throughout. HOWEVER.
when the girl got out and saw the ufo I didn't really like it. Now i had this movie spoiled by people who comment without saying spoiler so i knew there was some kind of alien invasion which probably made my reaction to the ufo we see first change. I liked the battle part, but wasn't my favourite part of the film at all. The ending was meh, could of has a better cliffhanger tbh but I could deal with it. 

Now here is my problem. I heard that this isn't a sequel and I was aware of that. However people have all stated and even the director in an interview, saying that this is in the same universe as the first movie. (clover field) I don't get it ? How could you tell that this is in the same universe. I might have missed some stuff in the movie that talks about the events that happened in the first film but I really couldn't find anything that told us this film was in the same universe. Anyone got ideas ?

Only three characters were prominent in the movie, but even that was enough. Goodman's character was strangely sane at some points, while he snapped at the slightest thing at other moments. His character was a masterpiece. Winstead played an excellent lead role, and like people say, was actually smart. Emett was a strangely cheerful character that lightened the mood and added some fun to the movie. 10/10 and a must see.",2016-03-29T15:24:13.000Z,0

1. ""Somethings coming"" is extremely vague and didn't seem to fit Goodman's demeanour.
2. The looking out the window and gasping seemed very artificial.
When I saw the movie, I got why both were like that.
1. That line isn't in the movie.
2. Spoiler:





The hand over the mouth was from an earlier scene, but it was placed in that moment to cover up the neighbour running up to the door and to misdirect you, but I already knew that as soon as she sees the door to begin with.",2016-03-29T10:37:19.000Z,0

*-Howard (Goodman) hits Michelle's (Winstead) car in the beginning of the movie by mistake cause her to crash and be knocked unconscious. Howard was rushing to his bunker before the ""Attack"" and decides to bring Michelle  along with him.

*- Michelle awakens and meets Howard, she is told about the ""Contaminated air"" and ""attack"" going on at the surface. She also meets Emmett (Gallagher) who was trying to get into the bunker before the ""attack"". It is also joked that it could be aliens.

*-Michelle is oblivious to anything going on at the surface and is unsure if she is being held against her will. She hears what she thinks are cars above her room in the bunker.

*- Emmett explains the something is definitely not right on the surface and that the bunker is the safest place to be. Michelle doesn't believe it and tries to escape during dinner (In trailer). 

*-When she looks through the door she witnesses a woman begging to be let into the bunker. Her skin is burning away and she is going insane, she begins banging her head on the door. Next scene jumps to Michelle back in the bunker. 

*-Assuming it's been a few weeks or even months, we see all three characters getting along and hanging out around the bunker. Things are seemingly normal. Howard seems more human with Michelle and often speaks of a girl she assumes was his daughter. She is shown a picture of the girl as well, names Megan.

*-The bunkers Air Filtration System goes down, Michelle is tasked with fixing it since she is the only one who can fit in the Vents (also in trailer). These vents takes her to another bunker room with an escape hatch.

*-After restarting the Air Filtration System, she investigates the room. The hatch has the word ""Help"" engraved on the window which is also somewhat bloody.  Michelle see's this and also finds a bloody earring from the girl in the picture she had seen.

*-Michelle  goes back into the main bunker and explains this all to Emmett. Emmett tells Michelle that his family left him and Megan was not his daughter, but a friend of Emmett's sister that went to school with him and went missing. 

*-Both Michelle and Emmett conspire an escape by crafting a Hazmat suit/gas mask using Michelle's fashionable skills learned from schooling (The final result seen in the trailer). 

*-Howard gets suspicious and pulls out a circular bin of something which is essentially Acid (seen in the trailer).Howard reveals a pair of scissors they were using and confronts both of them. He demands to know what they are doing with a weapon.

*-Emmett blames himself and says Michelle had nothing to do with it. Howard kills Emmett and disposes of the body by dismantling it and putting it into the Acid (Presumably what he did with Megan).

*-Michelle finishes the suit but Howard catches her before she can put her plan in action. Michelle fights and dumps the acid barrell, Howard falls into it. A fire is also started (seen in trailer). 

*-Michelle steals the suit back and escapes. While on the surface she see's birds. She removes the mask and we learn the air is actually clean. She hears noises and looks around and see's a mysterious ship.

*-It is confirmed that there is actually an attack, and that it is indeed aliens. The bunker blows up, attracting the ship's attention. The ship dispatches some alien dog thing after her that eventually runs away when it finds nothing.

*-She hears noise coming from the house and investigates (Seen in final trailer). Alien ship appears (These ships are Aliens themselves by the way, they have mouths) and Michelle destroys it with a Molotov Cocktail.

*-Michelle leaves the area and picks up a radio signal about the active Alien Invasion. There is talk about the humans winning if they can regroup in Houston. Michelle heads to Houston. The End.

Movie wasn't bad at all. Pretty solid for a brand new director. If you go in not expecting a Cloverfield sequel you will like it. There is a Cloverfield reference however (On a letter from Bold Futura from Cloverfield), if you also do some research you learn the Howard works for the Tagruato Corporation. http://www.slashfilm.com/10-cloverfield-lane-viral/ has lot's of side information about it as well more info about the purpose for the Bunker, the pending attack, and Howard mentioning Megan.

There is also a small reference to Abraham's other monster movie, Super 8 in the form of a Gas Station Michelle stops at before the crash in the beginning of the movie. The gas station was called ""Kelvin"" which appeared in Super 8. Fun reference. Makes it easy to mesh all the Abrams monster films together in the same universe.",2016-03-12T20:47:27.000Z,3

This movie has nothing to do with the monster from the original cloverfield, however this movie takes place near Louisiana and cloverfield took place in New York, at the end of the movie the main girl is listening to a broadcast which says that ""human forces have taking back the east coast""
New York is on the east coast, AND at the end of cloverfield the U.S. military called for a ""Hammer Down Protocol"" which is an air strike. so my thoughts are that this movie and cloverfield take place during the same time, but just in different parts of the United States. I think there are many monsters involved in this attack, the original cloverfield monster just being one monster. And In this movie they are more alien looking creatures, but all the monsters are from a common place.

I am a little iffy about this though. I am trying not to get my hopes up because from what it looks like its not really a sequel but more like whats happening to someone else around the same time. if i was them i would play it different. This girl  Should be getting home from the city after work she lives in up state new york and has no clue about whats going on in the city (government cover up) she should just get in a wreck and try to call for help but no one would be available to help till the following day so she begins walking home. mid was through her walk she finds a house with the bunker the guy comes from behind her knocks her out and when hes trying to get her away from his property he gets a call informing him of the monster he brings her into the cellar she wakes up he tells her somethings happening outside she thinks hes a rapist tries to escape makes it out and notices something is wrong and then the main plot of her survival begins. i would have the parasites attack the town shes in and they should focus on how the bites caused people to explode but they should have eggs come out of them (reproductive reasons) and have her find the girl who got in her own helicopter from the first one and its them trying to survive in a small town. this movie may be good but it probably wont be what most people are wanting.

cloverfield relates so much to movies like the thing the mist and others that they should just try to bring something into it",2016-02-11T08:54:51.000Z,0

I hope the chemical attack is just another way of saying cloverfield!",2016-02-07T16:41:29.000Z,1

They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one. Their throat is an open tomb; With their tongues they have practiced deceit; The poison of asps is under their lips; Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood; Destruction and misery are in their ways; And the way of peace they have not known.

The budget is waaaay to small for a monster movie i feel like. 5 million seems pretty low (even tho Cloverfield had a budget of 25 million which is also very very low so who knows)

But I do think they somehow exist in the same universe for a few reasons. Remember the viral marketing campaign involving Susho and that oil company. Apparently those websites have been inactive for 8 years (since the original came out) but just recently their being updated again. (source: http://cloverfieldclues.blogspot.com/). So something is obviously up with this universe that JJ Abrams has built. I don't know if its necessarily a prequel/sequel/anthology or anything but it's somethin.

Also that bottle she hits him over the head with is a real product called Swamp Pop (you can google it if you want) And on their website there's a product called ""Storm shelter supply"" for like $4000 that says ""out of stock"". this could be a way for the company to advertise in a really clever way or another ARG marketing technique.

Where they remain in shelter - the 3 survivors.  Eventually the Woman starts to trust Goodman less and less and believes that she is not there for her own safety but she is in captivity.
and he might be the monstor. So she tries to flee - Knowing of nothing - No clue as to what remains on the surface
As much as Goodman warns her to stay - She decides to flee.

Very unique.
I read many comments here and I don't believe most of them.
First off it is a sequel that I have heard takes place years after the first film.

My Plot predictions/hints/twists - Based off this trailer:
Why emphasize the buttons he is pressing on the jukebox?  Also it seems like more numbers than usually, - Obviously the writer or director chose these numbers with purpose.
The Poster of the Film:  Shows a house on a barn with a tunnel leading down into the earth's soil which connects to the bunker (this tunnel is also shaped in a ""L"" - same ""L"" used in the title for Lane) with a caption that says ""Monsters come in many forms"".

Using my crazy method of madness I took all this info - watched trailer again and tried to come up with theories.
Why the numbers - 4813?
I searched them up - nothing - I thought I would search them using the words Cloverfield - Nothing
The keywords - New York - hence first film takes place there - Nothing.
I noticed that when the numbers are pushed on the jukebox, it does not show the number one being pressed, only the number 3. This had me thinking that it was part of a sequence

SO, I thought maybe it;s biblical - sense most horrors are biblical in meaning.

search up many biblical texts - keyword 4813 - I found one.
Ephesians 4 8:-13
There is talk of the lord ""taking captives, and giving them gifts"". i.e., the man and woman John Goodman has ""saved"". It also speaks about His ""ascension"" however is does not speak of him going up into the sky and into the heavens. quite the opposite actually. it states: ""in saying ""He Ascended"", what does it mean but that he has also descended INTO the lower regions of the earth.""

“When he ascended on high he led a host of captives,
    and he gave gifts to men.”[a] 4 8:-13 Epehsians.

This movie was apparently filmed from Oct 20, 2014 to December 15 2014.
Considering it only took that long, It make you wonder some things like, ""What was the budget?"" or 
""Does the entire movie take place in the bunker?""

This was actually a completely different movie called ""The Cellar"" that had nothing to do with Cloverfield. it was finished but never released when Paramount's Insurge got canned. It got bought out Paramount proper and they and decided to slap Abraham's name and some re-shot scenes on it and title it like this to flip it and make some money off it.

You are all being had. They are taking a shit, 5 million dollar indie film that had nothing to do with ""Cloverfield"", giving it this title, and trying to recoup some of their money by baiting and switching. This is gonna be a HUGE fiasco.

His arm is in a sling throughout the trailer, and you have to wonder what happened to him -- was he in the same car accident as the girl, or did something or someone else cause his injury? He's also almost entirely passive, which might have to do with the whole arm-in-a-sling thing, but think about it -- this woman is being held hostage, handcuffs and all, and he doesn't seem to do anything to help her escape. That in itself is weird, and might suggest that he's in league with John Goodman's character, but the noticeable tension between the two seems to rule that out. Further, when Winstead hits Goodman over the head with a bottle, takes his keys and tries to get out, you don't see Gallagher trying to stop her. It's just odd.",2016-01-20T06:36:12.000Z,1

5) The 'quake', well that seems to be after but I can't tell in that scene if the band-aids on or not.

Summary: They seem to want to stay in so I'm guessing the 'threat' will either come from outside or it'll be the guy with the broken arm who ends up freaking since he didn't actually see whats outside. k?",2016-01-19T20:57:15.000Z,14

I personally think there's not gonna be a monster in this movie. I say this because it was loosely tied in with Cloverfield. It's in the same universe but different subject. It's probably gonna be saying that there's something different to fear. If it IS about the monster ""Clover"" that will suprise me a bit because from the looks of it, if this movie is in a bunker for an hour and we don't get to see the ""Monster"" (A threat, not exactly Clover) than its probably in more of a situation about the ""Unknown"". But this is just my opinion and it could be completely wrong. But just because it's in the same universe doesn't confirm whether we see the monster in this. I bet if u take out Cloverfield in the title after u watch it you'll like it more. I love the design of Clover in the movie but this one... eh. I'm just skeptical, it's just a money reel in my opinion. They loosely tie in Cloverfield with this movie to have MOST people expect to see the big monster they're scared of.

Paramount released their synopsis that mary elizabeth plays a character who wakes up in a bomb shelter after getting into a car accident. It's likely that the shots of her tied to the bed and lifting her phone up are shots of the very beginning of the film of her waking up and trying to receive signal but obviously failing because she is underground. Injured, no communication of the outside world and the sketchy nature of john goodman's character causes her wanting to leave and increases tension within the bunker. Thats where the dinner scene comes in, she hits goodman over the head with the bottle which is important to note. she almost escapes until she sees whatever it is outside or possibly even attacked and goodman might somehow save her and this causes her to change her mind. She goes into the bunker and goodman's character might show them a piece of whats out there, explaining the barrel and him wearing protective gloves for what we can assume is hazardous material. thats when all the happy shots of the trailer kick in because in all of them, john goodman's character has a band aid on his forehead where mary hit him. In terms of what's out there and what's coming, we dont know.",2016-01-18T22:21:11.000Z,4

destruction and people badly hurt or even dead the people being carried away on the stretches or whatever are all ripped open any ways they make there way to the middle of the city when the main character forgot his name gets a call from his girlfriend who all the way across town in a apartment building so they have to make there way to her and are caught in the middle of a battle between the military and the monster who has no name or is ever called anything they make there way into a subway to escape the carnage they find a map that'll lead them straight across town in  the subway without being In danger so they make there way through the dark subway with only the light of the camera guiding them they then come in contact with little monster things that are basically parasites of the bigger monster they get attalced by them and one of them is bite after this they get to a safe haven in a mall that is in control of the military and get more information on what's happening then all of the sudden SPOILER SPOILER UP AHEAD SPOILER SPOILER the friend who was bit starts to act weirdly and starts getting all pale and bleeding from her eyes the military infomants or doctors start yelling we got a bite over her and everybody starts going crazy they bring the girl behind a cloth hanging down with a light on it so you can see the outlines of the people then when there on the other side you can hear screaming and blood spits all over the cloth I really don't know what actually happened to her she's dead though after that the main character tells the general that they need to get across town to get to his girlfriends apartment the general tells him that they can't let them do that so after a couple minutes of reasoning the general lets them before informing them that the next evac chopper will be leaving very soon so they have to get back fast so the friends leave to the apartment when they get there they see what has happened to it its leaning to the other side of the other building and very close to collapsing so they make there way up in a sort of obsticle coarse to get to the top after they get get to the top they find his girlfriend trapeed under a boulder or something so they get her out and while there way down they encounter more of the parasites and have to defend them self they make it out quickly and get to the rendezvous  point in time of the miliray leaving after the base Is attacked by the monster they get into a helicopter where they are taken off while looking and seeing what is happening to the monster while the military is doing its best to hold it off the monster falls bringing a skyscapper down with it after they think they got it the monsters burst from the reckidge and attacks the choppr making it crash in a nearby park  they awaken from the crash to see one of there friend is injured and go to help him up one of the characters goes back to get the camera when he is startled by a giant monster right above him after the others screams his name  at this scene you get a rlly good look at what the monster looks like and its pretty terrifying  it roars at him after opening his mouth and devouring him to bits after the camera falls along with his torn UP body one of the other characters goes to get the camera after they go under a bridge for safety while you hear aircraft and jets fly by they then talk about what has happened and there names anfter telling each other they love them a  explosion is heard along with the camera going to black cutting to a scene from before where it shows the two couple on a date at a fair in a Farris wheel where the man asks his girlfriend if she had a good day she looks back at him and says""yes it was a good day"" that's when the film ends after the credits though there's a voice recording if played backwards says ""its still alive"" indicating that operation hammer down did not work that's the whole film sry if I messed up on spelling im on a phone writing this so that all that happened the reason. the title is cloverfield is because that's the name of the operation and that's were the director lived by a place called cloverfield in Manhattan I think but yes were the monster came from is from the ocean that's been sleeping for a while after a corporation that the main character is working for uses a sort of under water nectar for there drink slusho for a secret ingredient so while they are down there looking for more of the ingredient they found the monster and awoken it sorry for any mis quotes from the film oh and this film took place in new York and there's only one monster and that monster is just a infant so this movie I guess is after the first one and is a spin off not necessarily a sequel so I guess the monster escaped new York and went all around the world and made its way to other countries idk though but you should watch the first one its amazing",2016-01-18T20:31:17.000Z,0

One of the most interesting things about this trailer, for me at least, is the kind of roar or growl heard while the title is showing near the end. Now I know this isn't a direct sequel to the original Cloverfield, and I haven't watched the original in years, but from what I've heard recently after seeing this trailer, the monster in Cloverfield was only a child. And we know that at the end a nuke was dropped to stop the monster. The growl that is heard when the title shows makes me wonder: Did the monster survive the nuke, or did its mother wake up?",2016-01-18T06:47:23.000Z,0

Maybe this has something to with after the events of the original film, because I could have sworn that at the end of the original, the military nukes New York in an effort to destroy Clover.
Since this movie takes place in a fallout bunker, perhaps Goodman is a doomsday prepper nut, forces his ""family"" to live down in this shelter, and they literally have no idea whats going on above them.
The earthquake in the trailer could be the detonation of the nuke at the end of the first film... or everything I said could be false and they're just putting ""Cloverfield"" in the name to get attention.",2016-01-16T07:50:36.000Z,0

Ever wonder whats in ""Slusho!""
Kaitei No Mitsu aka ""Seabed's Nectar"" 
""Approved for US Distribution"" in this film's universe, or at least in Cloverfield.
i believe Jamie Lascano — she was the drunken, passed out girl on the couch at the party, consumed this ingredient in a pure form and  became deranged almost violent, and later maybe highly addicted to the ""Slusho!"" substance.
maybe most of America shared her fate who knows.. One things for sure, Something Big is out there.
i just think it would be really cool if they set this up 8 years ago with all those weird Cloverfield promotional websites and now it leads up to this movie. It would add so much more meaning to the overall universe J.J has created!!!

It's entirely possible John Goodman's character is justified in keeping them down in the bunker, or he could well be doing an Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. The ending of the trailer is the best part for me; we don't see what the woman sees, so what if nothing is out there? This is the point she realises Goodman's character has trapped her? Who knowa, but that is the hallmark of a phenomenal trailer. Take note Zack Snyder, this is how you edit a trailer without spoiling the crap out of your film.",2016-01-15T16:33:53.000Z,0

John Goodman is a scientist of some type. He knows that the Cloverfield monster is coming. And John Gallagher Jr. is his son. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is his son's girlfriend/wife.
He tries to warn them of the coming apocalypse and the will not heed his warning. So he forced them into his fallout shelter. Hence the broken arm of John Gallagher Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's need for a crutch in some scenes.
Thinking John Goodman has gone crazy Mary tries to escape. Only to see the world for what it is now. Possibly even seeing the Cloverfield monster or it's spawn.
Hence the scene in the trailer with the biohazard drum. That scene is clearly John Goodman trying to show them the truth. Either before or after Mary's attempted escape.",2016-01-15T15:53:02.000Z,3

For me Goodman here seems to be some kind of overprotective father, trying to keep those 2 young people from something dangerous they are unaware of and under his total control. The gun in his holster and a short peek of the handcuff on girl's (it seems to me) hand are the details that made me think that. Again what girl sees in the window of the exit door is a total surprise for her - but not for frightened to death Goodman. Plus both youngsters are temporarily crippled (could it be that Goodman intentionally does that to them so they couldn't leave the shelter?) and the old man is the only one fully able there.
