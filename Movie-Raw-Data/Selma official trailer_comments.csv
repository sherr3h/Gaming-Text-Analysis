The director did a great job, it was a great movie, the cast was amazing, particularly the actor who played Dr. King, and it did an excellent job of capturing the problems of that time, the hatred and disdain and vilification that King's supporters faced (the scene where he is in jail and he notes that Malcolm X called him a sellout for being non-violent is particularly heartbreaking). But Oprah is an icon of narcicisstic consumerism, she has no place in a movie about the struggles of real people. Get celebrities out of human rights activism - I mean I would love it if they would contribute, but stop demanding their smug faces be front and centre. Helping people should not be about self-aggrandizement and King knew that. His moral commitment and humility is exactly why people worship him today even though he wouldn't have wanted that.

Funny I've been alive for 36 years and I have never even met an actual white racist... People say things about the black race just like y'all say stuff about the white race... Blame gangsters and criminals for your bad reputations if u can't figure it out why were skeptical sometimes... And oh the fact that if we walked through one of your neighborhoods we probably would not live... Get it yet... It's not about white or black it's about how your race represents itself as a whole...  People stereotype it's a form of self protection and preservation, understand... If a well dressed well spoken black man tries to get a job against a white man I bet u they have the same equal chance of getting that job because 99%?of people I know judge people off their character... If u go in there with baggy pants lookin like u don't give a what then then yeah the person who seems to represent themselves better will get the job...moor the love of god we just had a black president... He didn't do y'all any favor s tho... He gave all the money we could have helped our vets and minorities with to terrorists and to destabilizing the Middle East,  and he kept all the bullshit regulations and red tape so that it's damn near impossible for any of u or anyone without mad capital to start a business... The Democratic Party needs for u to be poor af so they can get your votes and get more power and steal more tax money, since not many people can figure that out there it is... Have a nice day!

I didn't feel like watching it because I thought it was another movie made to make whites look like the devil. I've just finished watching this movie. What a great movie. It didn't portray the whites in a bad way at all. The message I got from this film was very positive, we the people united together, we can make a difference to change the present and the future. Bad people exist in every colour and size, it's up to us good people to stand together against them. I'm not a tree hugger or anything like that, I like things fair and square, the best person for the job should get the job based on their skill not colour, I'm a man of honesty, respect, honour.

I can't believe that this movie hasn't been on the mainstream, this movie is soo relevant in this day and age, there are so many un-armed black people who are killed by the police for just a ticket or a turn signal or just walking in the streets with a hoodie. I can't believe this movie was badly snubbed at the Oscars. I had no idea so many people were so brutalized only because they wanted the right to vote and most IMPORTANTLY BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS. I have a lot of respect for those black and white people who knew was something wrong within the society, and i also give respect to them for never giving up for equality. I also give respect to the people out in this century who care about BlackLivesMatter because you guys have acknowledged the fact that their is still racism in the world and especially in western society and i thank you black people for not giving up because no matter how many police officers come at your BlackLivesMatter protests in america you guys will never give up and will keep saying ""HANDS UP DON'T SHOOT!"".

I mean, David Oyelowo, Tim Roth, Oprah, Martin Sheen, Tom Wilkinson. Just an awesome cast. I do have to say though, that the way that they portrayed Gov. George Wallace was a little shotty. They nailed Wallace's annoyed stature but what they left out was that he was a FUMING racist. And yeah, Tim Roth did put his own southern/racist flair on the character, but before Wallace became ""accepting"" (Which I think is BS, just my own thought) of all people, he was a disgusting, bigoted man with a lot of problems. I just wish they told a little more of his story with the ways he really felt. Other than that, I thought this movie was brilliant.

It captured the struggle of the Selma to Montgomery March, so well. I actually heard sobbing during some scenes in the movie. The parts that were cinematic gold to me was when the riots started to occur and CBS capturing the whole thing. You see people at home crying and shocked in seeing innocent people getting beaten down and killed for no good reason. You feel like you were there sitting at home, hopelessly watching every single hit being hit on old and young bodies.  Caught in slow motion to see how horrible it was to be a black minority in the 1960s South side of selma Alabama . And also love the actor who played Dr, Martin Luther king. My first impression of him was... ''hmm he barely looks like him, pretty sure this movie is going to suck.'' I was DEAD wrong. That man knows how to act! He has the strong, yet peaceful voice same as MLK and even showed us it wasn't easy being in his shoes as well. What I got from the movie entirely is people always say you can't do something  just because of who you are. I watched this movie because MLK is a highly respectful role model to me as a young teen.

I don't know if you realize it but we all live in America and need to stand united> We are the ""Great Melting Pot"" and our country is multi-cultural. Every Culture has much to offer. Just go to the many Cultural Festivals we have in the USA and you will experience what each Culture has to offer and it is actually fun and pleasing to learn about Cultures, Food, Dances, Outfits, Music, etc.  We are the Great Melting Pot and every Culture has Much to Offer---so indulge and learn and be open to other cultures because we all have to live together. Your African Culture fought so hard to have same rights as everyone else: voting, equal education and chance to succeed, equal chance at employment, compete, and now you have it. so why are you trying to still SEGREGATE yourself from whites, having bad attitudes and mouthing off---when you yourself hated what happened to your people.  No More Reverse Discrimination....I was discriminated just recently by a Black Church I joined and was not able to sing in a choir or volunteer or talk to Pastor because I was White....that is wrong too..but since Churches are Private Entities, I was told, they are allowed to Discriminate....Not in God's Book....Skin is just a covering over our organs...Attitudes are different. Those are always wrong and that does push a person Away...but since there is a Separation of Church and State....nothing can be done. Churches are exempt from the Law I was told by several Police Officers who told me I cannot go to a Church if people do not want me because I am white and I cannot participate in a Black Church because I am White and that is Racism too and this is a Hate Crime against the Law under Title II and it is Reverse Discrimination yet no one does a thing about it because I am White and not Racist--but I do speak the Truth Boldly.

Ninety Nine percent of the time when you see a black man with a white woman, the woman is either fat, or has a kid or two, is much older (40 or over), is ugly or has some kind of obvious physical defect like a very homely face. She is usually driving because he is either to high to drive, has too many DUIs, or don't even have a license. He usually don't own a car of his own. Same goes with Mexican and other dark skinned men that go after white women selectively. Most white women that are slim,, attractive and have it going on don't like the dark meat. Just the facts. That is they type they go after because they don't have to put out much effort or cash.

David Oyelowo's performance as Martin Luther King deserves all the plaudits it gets and the writing by Paul Webb is fantasic. Especially because they were not allowed to use the original speeches because Steven Spielberg owns the rights to them. 
It's very surprising that there has not been a big feature film about King before and i'm not totally convinced that Selma is the one that is going to do the great man justice. Perhaps that will eventually come from Spielberg ?
I loved the old footage shown at the end of the film.

I've now seen all the films nominated for best picture at this years Oscars and i'm still not sure what i like best. I loved Birdman and Theory Of Everything but the one that sticks in my head longest after i saw it is Boyhood but for me the best film wasn't even nominated and that is NightCrawler.

- First, no ""white"" skin exists.  There a blacks, brown, tan, and pinks.  We are ALL colored.
- Second, ""American"" should be a term used for anyone who has citizenship of the Americas--not only the USA.
- Third, there should be a movement to make the media more representative.  Too make Euro looking people in ads and movies.
- Fourth, under-developed countries and ""ethnic"" people should stop treating Euro looking people as superior or the like.  Recognize that Western civilization came from some of today's third world nations and look at who lacks moral authority for causing both world wars.

The world is not what anyone thinks. There is so much stupidity in these comments it is baffling. The main stream media makes it seem like Americans invested slavery and it has always/will always be white vs black. Just another way to keep us apart. Dr. King is a hero and very important man, but it was not about slavery it was about civil rights. The first slaves in America were Native American, Irish, and African. Many of these  Africans were sold by AFRICAN slave traders, why do you think so many were conquered African Royalty? Slavery has existed  since the dawn of time, by all races all over the world, and it was white anglo saxon protestants who ended it. Why don't we talk about slavery still going on today in Africa? in India? Etc

Martin Luther King Jr. was an incredible man. He unified the nation and fought back against true injustice and racism. He did all of this through PEACEFUL gatherings, marches, and protests. The police had no right at all to attack the protesters because they were peacefully assembling. King didn't use this to gain power or to further any agenda. All he wanted was equal rights for all. He was a true civil rights activist who had a dream that people would not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.

Fast forward to today and things aren't much better. People claiming to be civil rights activists such as Al Sharpton, Jesse James, and even Obama are inciting all of this racial violence in the name of Martin Luther King Jr and civil rights. People honor the man by exercising exactly what he fought against: racism on all sides. As an outlet for all of their hate and anger, they turn to violence and looting. In this case, the police have the right to intervene as the riots threaten the lives of the people around them. I'm not saying all black people are taking part in these riots, and I'm also not saying that all the people taking part are even black.

We cannot fight racism with more racism. A black person can be racist just as much as a white person can. Black lives matter, but we ignore the fact that white, latino, asian, and especially police lives also matter. King did not fight for special privileges for black people, he fought for equality for all races.",2015-01-20T23:26:21.000Z,0

If it was propaganda it wouldn't have included the tape of Martin with the prostitute, mentioned how other blacks stand by the prejudice in Martin's speech during a marcher's eulogy, and this movie gave credit to the WHITE AMERICANS WHO JOINED THE MOVEMENT. As well it shown that not all blacks agreed with Martin as well as his strategies used to make the movement affective, not as a ""magical moral act against evil"", but a serious political shift protesting the violence of Hate in our country of America. I can imagine that this wasn't as serious happen in rest of America, but it WAS a problem in the south. I even agree that some things are NOT the ""white man's"" fault. For example, not getting an education, getting a job of honest living of ANY KIND, or how there is not enough blacks in state/city offices. I'm not racist towards whites, hell, many of the friends I ever had were WHITE. Hatred in this movie doesn't exist just among Blacks being persecuted by whites, but in India now, Israel now, Nigeria now, Haiti now, and the worst thing we Americans can do is act like it didn't happen to us, because that would be disrespectful to people born generations yesterday who either died or came back mortified and/or injured to give us these freedoms today. There are actual rallies, documentaries on groups that sided with supremacy, so how is it that this is one sided propaganda? If you have never witness hatred like this, many envy you, but as one of the many African American citizens of the future who's rights were given with the price of various life scarring and persistence , DO NOT say this didn't happened, DO NOT say I'm a hypnotized monkey because I LEARN about the rest of the world and met other people while you sit in your bubble. I will NOT respond to you if you can't appeal to logic, if One can believe brave men gave us our freedoms 300 years ago, what makes these men any damn different? In revolutionary times, families were TORN, Benjamin Franklin's for example, between independence and loyalty to the crown. People TODAY are beaten and/or killed for there culture or any other difference. The idea of Blacks being separated from Whites in theory doesn't sound so bad until violence takes place. Whites were the political citizens since colonial times and it wasn't until the late 1880's that Black slaves were freed and considered citizens. Now think, of course people weren't going to adjust to Black people as citizens in communities and, to be fair, many Blacks at the time (and today) didn't help their cause either by hanging on to the past as an excuse for not achieving in life. So there were to sides, Whites claiming superiority with severe prejudice, and Blacks not seeking opportunity and blaming them for ALL of their own faults. Still though, Martin, despite his flaws, and many others stood up and strategically thought and followed for more opportunities deserved and to reveal man's eternal folly, Hate as well as demonstrating how Blacks do have power to get places, the ""White man"" is no excuse. This film serves a purpose for reminding people both the many who suffered for freedom, like the martyrs in times of Christ, and the opportunities we have today and how possible for us to have an honest living compared to yesterday. Maybe, with the wealth and resources my parents (who are from the 1960's) worked hard to give me, I can remind people this, because now it is easier than ever before in our country which, while it DEFINITELY has it's freedoms, still has woe to the people.",2015-01-18T05:35:57.000Z,0

Martin Luther King stood up against a racist government...a very powerful government and won. A preacher who made the American people and the world take notice of how black people were treated in America. I respect him and many other black people who stood up against American segregation. Segregation was barbaric,  shameful and ignorant. It's disgusts me that you have some Hispanics dismissing what black people had to go through in that time. Hispanics had suffered racism but no where near as much as blacks in America. Trying to overcompensate their racism towards black people is shameful. All because some Hispanics think their white and some just try and believe that white people are the pinnacle. This is wrong. Movies like Selma are a reminder of American shameful history. This is why you see racist comments on here (defensive mechanism). Another thing that disgusts me is the Coconuts on here. I read some comments from Oreos saying tripe like...""MLK is done"" or ""that was then this is now, can't black people learn to forget?"" These comments are disgusting. Of course black will never forget what black people had to go through to make sure black people of today had freedom! Coconuts...""wana be white Hispanics""...racist whites are shameful in today's society. 

Be proud of what MLK and millions of blacks and whites that fought for freedom and equality.

The film 'SELMA' is timely. Republicans now have control of both the Senate and the House. The country is moving to the RIGHT, politically.

The possibility of having a Republican president in 2016 is real. When that happens, CIVIL RIGHTS, and in particular, VOTING RIGHTS will be CURTAILED.

It is happening already. In Florida, Georgia, Kansas, and many states. Republican governors and state legislatures dominate the political landscape across the nation. They have redrawn ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES, to their political advantage, where it makes it virtually impossible for Democrats to win state and federal elections.

The age of the NEW JIM CROW is upon us with a vengeance. This is where SELMA comes in. It is sending a very graphic and bloody message to AFRICAN-AMERICANS and HISPANICS that they FORGET that bloody history of murderous opposition to BLACK VOTER REGISTRATION at the their peril.

As the nation advances slowly but surely toward a MAJORITY-MINORITY nation, GOP politicians at a STATE and FEDERAL level will revert back to what they know best and are very good at doing - craft and pass UNJUST LAWS to CURTAIL BLACK CIVIL AND VOTING RIGHTS to REMAIN in POWER as LONG as possible at the STATE and FEDERAL LEVEL.

SELMA is a brutal reminder to AFRICAN-AMERICANS, HISPANICS and PROGRESSIVE WHITES that they better smell the coffee and wake up to the fierce urgency of now.

They must ENGAGE IN AN INCESSANT STRUGGLE at all levels to DEFEND and PROMOTE CIVIL and VOTING RIGHTS by ALL JUST MEANS NECESSARY.",2014-11-22T13:08:20.000Z,0

Four things you didn't know about Martin Luther King 

1. His name wasn't Martin Luther. It was Michael. It was decided Martin Luther had a more prominent ring to it, so he went by that. He never legally changed his name. To this day, he lived and died as Michael King. 

2. While working on his dissertation for his doctoral degree at Boston University, he heavily plagiarized from another author who had done research on a subject similar to King's. As academic committee later found that over half of King's work was plagiarized, yet would not revoke his doctrine. King was dead by this time, and the committee ruled that revoking the title would serve no purpose. It was also discovered that King's famous I HAVE A DREAM speech was also not his own. He stole it from a sermon by Archibald Carey, a popular black preacher in the 1950's. 

3. King was under FBI surveillance for several years (until he died) due to his ties with communist organizations throughout the country. King accepted money from the organizations to fund his movements. In return, King had to appoint communist leaders to run certain districts of his SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership Conference), who then could project their communist ideas to larger audiences. A federal judge in the 60's ruled that the FBI files on King links to communism to remain top-secret until 2027. Senator Jesse Helms appealed to the Supreme Court in 1983 to release the files, so the correct bill in the Senate to create the Martin Luther King Federal Holiday could be abolished. He was denied. 

4. One of King's closest friends, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, wrote a book in 1989 in which he talked about King's obsession with white prostitutes. King would often use church donations to have drunken sex parties, where he would hire two to three white prostitutes, occasionally beating them brutally. This has also been reported by the FBI agents who monitored King. King was married with four children. 

Martin Luther King Day. A day when this country will come to a screeching halt so we can have parades and memorials to honor this man, a man that most of the world views as a saint for his role in the civil rights movement. No other public holiday in the United States honors a single individual. Of all the great leaders in our Nation's history-none of them have their own holiday. All of our great war heroes share Memorial Day. All of our great presidents share President's Day. Yet king — a man who was a phony, a cheater, a traitor, and a sexual degenerate gets a day of his own.﻿",2014-11-18T21:16:44.000Z,0

First, this is NOT a MLK biopic or a film based on him. If you look at the close history, King made infrequent visits to Selma during the Spring of 1965. Of course he was everywhere doing his thing. There were many players in the Selma March. I already saw a huge error in the trailer. The white man that strikes Dr. King in the face was a member of the American Nazi party James Robinson. And he didn't hit him the face. He struck him in the back of the head while King was checking into a hotel. I sincerely hope that this isn't another The Butler. They made that into a civil rights film instead of his unique life as a WH butler on the staff. Don't forget that his rebellious son (British actor playing King in this film) was at every big event in civil rights in the 1960's. Even at the Lorraine Motel.

There are an equal amount of white AND black people who would like to forget this time period and move on as if it didn't exist, but can you understand the reasons why say women have the right to vote, without first understanding the suffragist movement? If you're a black person in America, you got where you are and the rights you have now because an entire line of people before you took both mental and physical beatings so you wouldn't have to and if you're a white person in America, hopefully this film will show you personally may not be those racists standing there with clubs, but those people did exist, this did happen, and ignoring it and pretending like this didn't happen won't make that period in history go away for you either. This moment in time was instrumental in changing a lot of the views whites held against blacks at the time, and as the movie also illustrates despite those prevailing views, there were many people, white and otherwise who stood with black people at the time and recognized the injustice right in front of them. Neither whites nor blacks can re-write history, but hopefully this film will show a new generation how deep a divide this country used to be in, and though much improved, how in many respects that divide is still there, but anyone can be an agent of change by learning from the mistakes of the past and learning to accept people as people.",2014-11-11T14:14:44.000Z,1

What we see in this film is a reflection of what is happening in America right now. Ferguson is a battle ground where black people are being murdered by authority figures that get away with it because the system lets them. While racist Tea Party bigots can take positions of power in D.C. because the common folk here in the U.S. are a racist as they are.

I hope this film wakes everyone up and America changes for the better. But Im sure we can count on racist over-privileged white people sticking to their entitled guns till the day they die by them.

Its your white record companies that push gang banger music, its your white teens that buy most of it, its your white politicians de-funding the public schools that keeps people of color ignorant, its your for profit corporations run by old white men building prisons and deporting jobs that keep the crime rates soaring, its your voter-caging the felons you create that keeps them from voting and changing the countrys leadership for the better, its your white privilege that hold this nation back keeping blacks AND whites poor and dumb that is tearing this nation apart.

And all the while you blame the victims of your actions for how they behave in the face of a world that tells them they dont belong and beats them and kills them for not fitting into that world.

So FU white America, I hope angry black mobs burn your cities to the ground. Its what you get for giving certain people nothing to loose and pushing them to the edge.

This movie is more about voting rights and the rights the U.S. Constitution grants citizens and the protest it took for those rights to be extended, in my opinion (based on research).  If you see this a movie about race, you only see the surface shimmer.  The rights those people marched for are for all Americans.  You have Internet access do your own research. Ask yourself why would the state police stop a peaceful march from one city to another? Ask yourself why would people travel from miles to away, white, black, etc to join in a March which may result in your death? After you get those answers, ask yourself what would you be willing to march, fight, and die for, your country, your rights, your children?
Let us not be mindless robots, let us make our own minds up, do diligence people.  It's a movie about our country's past 50 years this coming March. #MarchOn

1. His name wasn't Martin Luther. It was Michael. It was decided Martin Luther had a more prominent ring to it, so he went by that. He never legally changed his name. To this day, he lived and died as Michael King. 

2. While working on his dissertation for his doctoral degree at Boston University, he heavily plagiarized from another author who had done research on a subject similar to King's. As academic committee later found that over half of King's work was plagiarized, yet would not revoke his doctrine. King was dead by this time, and the committee ruled that revoking the title would serve no purpose. It was also discovered that King's famous I HAVE A DREAM speech was also not his own. He stole it from a sermon by Archibald Carey, a popular black preacher in the 1950's. 

3. King was under FBI surveillance for several years (until he died) due to his ties with communist organizations throughout the country. King accepted money from the organizations to fund his movements. In return, King had to appoint communist leaders to run certain districts of his SCLC (Southern Christian Leadership Conference), who then could project their communist ideas to larger audiences. A federal judge in the 60's ruled that the FBI files on King links to communism to remain top-secret until 2027. Senator Jesse Helms appealed to the Supreme Court in 1983 to release the files, so the correct bill in the Senate to create the Martin Luther King Federal Holiday could be abolished. He was denied. 

4. One of King's closest friends, Rev. Ralph Abernathy, wrote a book in 1989 in which he talked about King's obsession with white prostitutes. King would often use church donations to have drunken sex parties, where he would hire two to three white prostitutes, occasionally beating them brutally. This has also been reported by the FBI agents who monitored King. King was married with four children. 

Martin Luther King Day. A day when this country will come to a screeching halt so we can have parades and memorials to honor this man, a man that most of the world views as a saint for his role in the civil rights movement. No other public holiday in the United States honors a single individual. Of all the great leaders in our Nation's history-none of them have their own holiday. All of our great war heroes share Memorial Day. All of our great presidents share President's Day. Yet king — a man who was a phony, a cheater, a traitor, and a sexual degenerate gets a day of his own.",2014-11-08T04:47:57.000Z,1

Okay. First of all, segregation is still a thing in Selma, Alabama. I have been there firsthand, and experienced it. I am going again in March, and this movie is such a big deal for me. Secondly, this movie is important to show what happened in Selma, pertaining to the events of Bloody Sunday, on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.
This movie is going to mean a lot to the people who live in Selma, who continue to fight for integration today, and to change the mindset of the entire town.
I have heard stories of people leave multi-billion dollar jobs just to move to Selma to fight segregation. Some people have had death threats, and had round the clock surveillance, because they just want to fight for integration. I have met the children of this town who are caught up in the middle, and who work together to show the town that it isn't just black and white. I have met people who were involved in the Bloody Sunday event, and heard their stories about how they didn't even know they were bleeding until someone pointed it out to them. And I have met people who remember this day like it was yesterday, who carry on the legacy of those who lost their lives.
So please, do not bash this movie because it's ""just another Civil Rights movie;"" this movie is very important to the people who can relate to this time, and to those who are still fighting in that town today.",2014-11-07T19:26:35.000Z,1
