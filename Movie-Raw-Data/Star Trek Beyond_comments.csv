Ever Since I was a Young Seed The Only Thoughts that used to Soothe Me,
Were The Fantasies that I would create special effects for The Movies!,
I already knew that I could Dance and Draw Like Nobody Had Ever Saw Before!,
  Robotic Glide Pop Lockin'! And Got Rhymes Galore!,
I can design Anything that anyone can explain,
It's manifestation will Bang Off Brightly Inside My Brain!,
I got my Start! With Jada Pinkett and Tupac In Baltimore School For The Arts!,
& I was At Least The 2nd Or 3rd BEST!,
I really didn't stress,
Except inside I Did!,
I deeply remember my thoughts when being a kid,
And Now I wish I would have Done!,
Back then ....GOod Things that I never Did,
I thought my life would be Magic!,
I thought I'd be In Hollywood with other artists like Michael Jackson and Janet,

But I'm still irritated by a lot of the bad guys logic. ""War is good because it makes us strong. Piece is bad because it makes us weak."" Of course if you're not at war then you don't need to be strong except as a deterrent against future war. Having a strong military to prevent war is very logical. But starting a war to make the country/planet/whatever strong defeats the point. Then there is the fact that the bad guy is a bit of a psycho from being shipwrecked. But I get the impression he became an immortal king of the entire planet overnight. It really doesn't seem like such a bad place to retire on. But more importantly his new subjects had space travel. He could have probably left within the first week if he had wanted to. That part I don't think was ever really addressed.",2017-10-10T04:39:28.000Z,1

If they have such advanced cloaking devices why can't they just turn invisible and go sneak into the base to activate the magic thing that removes the ""geological interference"" to teleport the prisoners out.    Why does bones need to go with spock to teleport into the enemy ship? Is he going to give him medical treatment for his disappearing and reappearing injury while spock is fighting??  IF THEY CAN TELEPORT PEOPLE INTO THE ENEMY SHIP WHY NOT JUST TELEPORT A BOMB IN THERE??? Teleport the enemy ship exploding beastie boys boombox. use the magic teleporter to do anything that doesn't require suicidally driving into the enemy swarm. If the enemy ships main method of attack is to fly right through your ship to cut off its engines like we saw in the beginning then why did they suddenly stick into that old franklin ship instead of going right through it? Why did that Krall guy start out with a British accent and then change into some weird african accent?  Why didnt the krall guy die when he shot him? Why would he only shoot him once considering he's holding a WMD that is about to kill millions??  He fuckin has a conversation with a guy holding a WMD.. Why wouldnt he just shoot him 20 times as soon as he saw him? Why can't scotty use the teleporter to teleport krall back to the ship? He obviously knows where he is considering he's telling kirk what he's doing with the ""gravitational slipstream"".",2017-09-03T02:39:29.000Z,0

I mean ok, i enjoy Kirk and co, but the plot was pedestrian at best and i've seen less generic villains in a Power Rangers episode. Both factors were absolute zero, compared to Into Darkness.
And then we get the one-note hot alien babe we're supposed to drool at/feel for and who - sad shocker - likes rap. Did the director think only hare-brained high schoolers would watch this? (with no disrespect to Sofia Boutella.... besides, why even cast her if you won't make proper room in the movie for her dancing skills like Kingsmen did? All we get is some flat, inelegant combat).

And the scene where the alien drones form a literal wave and the Franklin rides it while playing crap music, leaving a trail of exploding enemies behind, complete with the part where the ship flies in the alien drone wave equivalent of the green room?

I really hope they pick someone else to direct the next. Take Douchin Lin and send that sissy boy back to his beach to direct Furiously Dumb 17 or whatever.",2016-12-05T09:55:22.000Z,0

I enjoyed it much more than I thought I was going to from seeing the trailers.  It felt like a Star Trek movie should.  The villain was a little bit too much of the tired trope ""former ally turns evil and tries to take revenge"" type, but Idris Elba at least portrayed him well.  The most enjoyable parts of the movies for me were the character interactions with the crew, though I did also enjoy Jaylah and her role in helping them find the USS Franklin, which seemed like a nod back to the Enterprise series, which I very much miss, so it was nice to see that thrown in.  I was really hoping the villains in this might turn out to be Romulans, which would have added more depth than the ""former captain wants revenge on Star Fleet"".  I'm really hoping you guys do something with them in the near future, as they were some of the most interesting villains in the franchise and certainly during TOS and TNG timelines.",2016-08-03T13:15:41.000Z,0

Beyond is definitely homage to the more adventurous classic episodes and is geared to broader audiences than last film and i can appreciate the change. Crew is once again amazing and chemistry is off the charts, adventure kicks into 5th gear and never stops, dialogue is witty and fresh and it makes you feel for the characters. It is also exciting, thrilling and always on the edge of your seat entertainment. What bothered me is how Justin Lins directing style doesn't mesh with star trek tradition and how god awful villain in this movie was. I mean the directing was really awful, there were moments where i just could not see what is going on, especially during the dark scenes. As for Krall/Edison it was the most lazy, generic and uninspiring way to go about bad guy and it just did not work. I did not care about him or his agenda. Overall it delivers as fun summer popcorn entertainment and i was satisfied when credits roll plus it was kinda sad when you say goodbye to Leonard and Anton in the end, may they rest in peace. 3.5/5",2016-07-25T15:24:33.000Z,0

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,The movie was ok but they could of come up with an original idea for the movie.  Because they stole the plot from Star Trek Insurrection.  The new alien bad guys of the movie are out to kill humans.  And later on a member of the crew discovers that the new aliens are humans also.  And instead of attacking a planet the aliens are attacking a space station.  But the sequence when they attack the aliens is good.  Because they use Beastie Boys music to do it.,2016-07-23T03:15:09.000Z,0

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"For all those who are critiquing Spock's human tendencies, please remember that they created room for this development by introducing a time traveling Spock who influenced his younger self. His mother originally lived a lot longer until Nero came back in time and destroyed Vulcan. This exposed Spock to his human emotions which, by nearly direct instructions from the original Spock, Kirk exploited to gain command of the Enterprise in the 2009 movie. This Spock has lost his mother and his homeworld at a point in his life where his hasn't had time to build up a strong enough wall to mask his human side. He has also explored a romantic relationship with Uhura during his time of crisis which further opened him up to his emotions. I'm not sure why everyone is so upset about the character development straying from TOS but clearly you're lacking a grasp of the concept of time travel. Introducing that one element into the new series has left all future character development and encounters with TOS villains like Khan to be unpredictable and therefore better able to entertain a new generation and old fans alike by taking us down an alternate timeline. Let's stop hating so much on all the changes and see where this new road takes us. I'm sure Kirk wouldn't mind seeing how his alternate self faired by striking his own path without his father around.",2016-07-22T23:43:21.000Z,0

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Hello Everyone, I feel I need to post this. For those who might have missed it, due to a fan based film both CBS and Paramount have issued ""guidelines"" that actually destroy all the possibilities of anymore real fan based trek films in the future. If you would like to know more search for ""star trek prelude to Axanar"" and watch the previews and details about the show. There are many fan based films for you to watch and some are really good considering they are not made by a real studio. You will even see a few real actors are involved and the efforts have been made to have a very high quality of production. Yes, some not so much but its about Star Trek not production. Now please consider that for many years now they (CBS and Paramount) have allowed a few groups to make many really good (and some not so good) episodes based on Star Trek in many versions as long as they do not ""make a profit"" from the production. To actual start making the episode Axanar they had a fund drive and made over 1 million US Dollars so, CBS and Paramount sued them to stop production. Recently they released the ""guidelines"" for all future fan based films that are not only not constitutional points (like actors who worked in any trek can’t work in fan based films and vice a versa) but limit production time and costs in such a way that means no less than a clear effort to kill all fan based Star Trek films. Read the complete set of guidelines here: http://www.startrek.com/fan-films
I ask all fans to get educated on these Star Trek fan based films to read up on this matter. Please learn the facts about the past films and the possibility of future for more of them. If you cannot agree that CBS and Paramount be allowed to force these guidelines on fan film production please help us stop them. Also please compare the way the fan films for Star Wars are treated where they even offer a public awards show for them. I, and other Star Trek fans are calling for a boycott of the upcoming movie and the 2017 series on CBS unless they publicly stop this and provide the fans with a reasonable and legal ability to enjoy others ideas of the Star Trek world. They have allowed it for years but now they are moving to kill them while hoping it won’t affect them making more money off Star Trek. So, let’s boycott them and stop the money they would make from the 7-22 release of Star Trek Beyond and the 2017 series planned to have one show on TV then the rest on a pay service only from CBS. If they see enough decrease of the upcoming movie sales they will obey us as the fans and workout a real reasonable way for them to continue without the idiotic and illegal current guidelines. I, and more than 20 people I know have agreed to boycott the new film unless this is fixed right. 
Thanks for your time.",2016-07-07T23:13:19.000Z,0

I'll watch it because I'm a die-hard Star Trek fan of the OS, but I'm not very hopeful after watching this trailer. I sure hope it turns out to be better than what this trailer doesn't promise it to be. Maybe it's the trailer that's not so good... I doubt. As for Spock now embracing his ""human side,"" that's just crappy. It ruins so much with Star Trek's OS dynamic of Spock's logical decisions and inability to understand human emotions. If there is life in the universe there just might be species out there who don't feel emotions like we are familiar with. They might be entirely logical in their decision making. What a shame to not have a species like Spock remain Vulcan and logical. That alone makes it ""not Star Trek."" Producers are losing touch with what Star Trek was all about.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Destruction! Loud things! Impossible odds! This just screams ""formula action movie"". This isn't Star Trek at all, it's a video game. 

There are enough Transformers, Fast and Furious, and comic book adaptation movies to keep the adrenaline junkies satisfied. Can't we have one franchise that is just a bit cerebral? Somehow, Hollywood has incorrectly conflated ""Intelligent"" with ""Boring"". Do you know what boring really is? Motorcycle jumps. Car chases. Surviving fire and massive explosions by ""ducking"". 

Action is fine, but every movie franchise seems to want to rewrite the laws of physics and human physiology. Suspension of disbelief only goes so far, and after that it's clear that you've made your characters invincible and immortal, unless you choose to kill one off for shock value. That's really boring. 

There has to be someone who can write and direct something that's a happy medium between Star Trek: The Motion Picture and the rebooted Star Trek: The Running, Jumping and Explosions with Lens Flares.",2016-05-21T13:12:59.000Z,8

Yeh, I am a writer, I dont have the big connections, it is annoying to see people get paid a great deal for so little thought. I thought the 2009 one was alright and Eric Bana played his role perfect. These movies are like 5/10 movies to me, I think Nimoy saved the 2009 one along with Pike.  Star Trek is all about intellectual prowess. Not just action, they should of started where Kirk is a Cadet and becomes Captain in the third part of a trilogy. Losing Pike in the third act rather than the second, sometimes it takes a great deal of suffering and many mistakes to become a good leader, not a cocky kid. They seem to just give him everything so quickly and easily, they should of made Kirk feel fully responsible for Pikes death and Spock help him see the logic. Beastie Boys track is kind of stupid, its not essential, if you want to create a reminiscing event, use a similar event with higher stakes, not a song. I guarantee no one will remember that song by that time. This is Star Trek,  not Die Hard, its just a sheer example of an ego getting in the way of development by putting forward things that do nothing to serve the whole story.",2016-05-16T10:23:11.000Z,2

However, I am still holding out hope that this trailer is just awful (like Simon Pegg says), and the movie itself is more akin to ""real Star Trek"". But even that hope is holding on by a thread, as this movie was incredibly rushed, is STILL undergoing re-shoots, and the studio producing it allegedly stated that they want this movie to be ""less Star Trek-y"".

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"I saw the first of these Star Trek Reboot movies a few years back and swore I would never see another one of them.  Not because of the cast, who did a good job, or the direction, production or action, each of them equally good.  What I didn't like was the fact that they were made at all.
Let me try to explain.  I grew up watching Star Trek TOS & TAS  reruns in the 1970's.  I vaguely remember my dad watching TOS in the 60's when it was on prime time.  TOS and TAS were shows that reflected, commented and addressed the era and issues they were created in:  The 1960's and 1970's.  The characters themselves often were reflecting the people of that era as well and the way they thought, acted and reacted to situations similar to those of those eras .  I can say that TNG, DS9, and Voyager did the same for the 1980's and 1990's as well.
But taking Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew and totally rewrite the history of the franchise to have characters from the 1960's act, think and react to situations from the 21st Century is not only unfair to those of us who grew up in the 60's and 70's but its unfair to the young people of today.  Us old people(I'm in my 50's) deserve to have our generations historical treasures left alone while the young people deserve to have characters, stories of THEIR own which reflects THEIR era(Today).  I don't mind taking the Star Trek universe onward like with shows like TNG, DS9 and Voyager(Don't even talk to me about Enterprise) but don't rewrite history.  LEAVE IT ALONE!
Now please understand that I'm not blaming the younger generation for this.  The kids today are, as a whole, a good generation with some incredible views on the world.  They also are a source of free tech support to a middle aged man who's smart phone occasionally does something its not supposed to do(LOL).  Its MY generation who's deciding to play it safe by rebooting everything and feeding them recycled mind candy.",2016-04-29T21:24:13.000Z,1

It was an AMAZING journey of insight and self discovery. But these movies you are making, Paramount... They just are not what Trek is all about. And that makes me very sad. I accepted the first Star Trek ""shoot 'em up"" as just a way to get more people involved into the franchise who may not be familiar with it. I gutted the 2nd one's premature use of one of the series' pinnacle villains to basically follow the same underlying premise as Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan; just accepting it as the price of having some form of Star Trek that was new. But when I saw a THIRD movie shaping up to be yet another ""blow stuff up"" Star Trek, it was then that I finally accepted the fact that there must be no one left at Paramount who has any sort of clout that remembers what Trek is all about. It should by learning about ourselves as we embark on that amazing next step out into the stars. While, yes, there may be the occasional blatant rollercoaster ride, for the most part, traditionally it has dared to ask the tough questions in clever ways. And I think that is what I am missing the most here: it's that this Star Trek isn't clever. It seems to just expect me to sit back and oo and ah while it makes references to itself. That is, itself from a time when it really mattered. And now with the whole Axanar lawsuit - and don't get me wrong, Paramount, I can kind of see where you are coming from - I just wonder if Star Trek finally really is dead? And in a day and age where the only real metric of corporate success is measured by growth, ironically it's all about money which is one of the very things that Gene Roddenberry himself had REMOVED from our future! (I'm talking strictly Federation, here) I guess it will stay alive in the hearts and minds of the millions - MILLIONS - still alive who will continue to make amazing fan fiction, which includes movies.

There are few things I really truly need in life and believe it or not Star Trek is one of the things that gets my immobile body out of bed and into my wheelchair each day. Now, here it is the 50th anniversary of Trek...I have made it to this date after growing up with it throughout the years...I have reached this milestone with Trek faithfully by my side in many life events and decisions...and I've found it dying. Please don't let the true spirit of Trek die.

The intro to the first of this series made me cry like a baby and was passionate and awsome. Cumberbatch as khan was perfect, for all you haters rewatch the movies, the actors in new series went back and studied film to try to make sure their characters match, and there was many of time in certain shots i saw shatner in chris pine, and spock was perfect and the whole cast is awsome.. soo.. if you don't love it.. lets play a game of hide and go f*** yourself :)",2016-04-16T03:08:12.000Z,0

Paramount, did you forget about your fans? I think so, these films have no meaning to the franchise what so ever, star trek was about using real world issues and incorporation them into a futuristic environment, to send a strong and powerful message to the world and thats what made the Star Trek franchise one of a kind! 

I love all three of the new films visually, cant fault them at all, but its more then Special effects, please stop destroying something that has helped me get through some of the shittist times in my life, please stop ruining the name and legacy of Gene Roddenberry! just please stop!!!! And please for the love of all things Star Trek do not butcher the new TV serious with your meaningless scripts!

On the tracks of the new TV serious, Why for the love of god are you making it pre Enterprise? cant you advance the story? why are you relying on something people already know? its cowardly as fuck! and you know it! this means you can use already established races, ships and so on, Making a show after Voyager is the only Logical thing to do, but after all these years we get stuck with this! I predict now its going to blow chunks! and if it dose do well it wont be due to the old fans, it will be to your new ones! Fuck you Paramount! and have a good day",2016-04-15T14:18:07.000Z,0

Look at how Paramount teased ST 6 for its 25th if you want to see how respect of a beloved franchise is treated. Look at how Dr. Who and Star Wars are treated by people who love and respect the history of a show, and all the talented people who came before them. 

Star Wars gets treated with all the reverence of a visit by the Pope. The Falcon is rebuilt in exquisite detail. Star Trek gets all of its history flushed down the toilet (except they keep reusing everything anyway for lack of an original idea), and we get an Apple store and a brewery for an Enterprise.

Since the ST franchise is now split in two by corporate buyouts - movies are made and owned by Paramount and Trek TV is owned by CBS/Viacom, we faithful Trekkies may have to give up on the film franchise. Hopefully the new series by CBS (who took the time and effort to restore TOS with new effects and do a frame-by-frame remaster of TNG), will be more faithful. Besides that, Trek was created for TV, and still does best in that format.

So the alternate universe belongs to Paramount. CBS/Viacom owns the ""real"" one. At this point I sincerely hope this is the last Trek movie.",2016-04-07T16:07:46.000Z,0

It has been replaced with the nonsense we now see from Paramount. Its one thing to change it by going back (almost) to the beginnings and changing its history, its quite another to make the new movies so bad they are actually unwatchable by any standards of movie making. The scripts are awful, the acting below par and the cgi runs riot, destroying any chance of believability. I grew up watching Star Trek, I bought the videos and dvds from Paramount, and I was a fan. But we were all cut loose to make way for a new generation of fans, and it sticks in my craw guys and girls. There is only one Captain Kirk, one Spock, and one McCoy.

There seems to be quite a lot of people thinking that Roddenberry would not care for the newer films post 2009. But from what I understood, Roddenberry was forced out of creative control for The Wrath of Khan back in the 80's because the first film was met with mixed reviews. Harve Bennett was given the reigns and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was a big success. People look at Roddenberry as some sort of amazing visionary. That dude cheated on his wife ALL THE TIME (a.k.a. ASSHOLE). So remember, he's just a regular guy, a horney one for sure, even though he created a cool concept for a t.v. series. That's really all it was, a T.V. show. Which means all of that shit is made up and doesn't matter. It's fun but by the end of the day I have to pay my bills, do regular 21st century stuff and pay off the toy Enterprise-A and Bird of Prey on my sons shelf I bought with a credit card.

I measure that from the first impression I got from watching a movie, not from how well it's held up over the years. All this being said, Star Trek movies always suffered from the fact that they never seemed to move on from the TVshow format. JJ Abrams was right on the money, when he asked why ST movies always were shot as if they were on a tight budget and short deadline. The scope was usually as narrow as in a TV episode, and the decore was often only marginally better. Compare the warpcore and engineering from the pre-Abrams era to the new. Small sets, every bulkhead looked like plastic and plywood. Not exactly the feel of a huge starship the size of several city blocks. Especially later, this created a huge contrast between the interior shots and the CGI space shots. Yes, even in Nemesis. 80s, 2000s, 80s, 2000s etc

Thank god this is the last one and the nightmare can end.  2017 can't come fast enough.  CBS will have their opportunity to prove they can do Trek better than this mess.  Here's hoping there will finally be good Star Trek airing again.  

I'm getting tired of talking to teenagers and having to explain, ""No, no, see, Star Trek actually used to be deep, thoughtful, compelling storytelling.  Some of the best hours of science fiction ever televised.  The Inner Light, Measure of a Man, Best of Both Worlds, Duet, The Visitor, What You Leave Behind...  Heck, even a couple Voyager episodes were good, like Scorpion and Timeless.  Trek wasn't really about phasers and warp speed, it was about stories.  Stories about hope and courage and decency and ethics, science fiction was just the setting, they were really always about heart.  ...Hey.  Hey, stop laughing, I'm serious.""

With low-brow schlock like most of Enterprise, all the TNG movies, and the Abrams movies, how can I possibly hope to explain to youngsters what Trek used to be back when it was good, before the franchise decided to let it rot on the vine?

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Wow you guys are pathetic. I mean seriously. If you compare every movie, or every new series that they create to the original Star Trek series then you may as well just kill the series now. It is proof in itself that the creatore of Star Trek made something special because they are still making movies about it. If every movie and every series was JUST LIKE the original then the franchise would just die, it would be boring, repeatitive, and have no life ion it what so ever. The movies are starting to move with the times, as we do. Yes there is more action in them, but that doesnt stop you feeling or connecting with the characters. It doesnt stop you from getting involved in the story. Yes maybe they could put some more memorable lines in there and maybe bring out the history a little more but they can only put so much into a movie. You guys are picking at the smallest of things, like the song choice for the trailer as an example... WTF is the point in that? Your honestly gonna sit there and bitch about a sing choice? Grow up already. Then your going to bitch about the fact that theres a motorbike in it and automatically link it to the director because he did Fast 7? again, grow up. Instead of camparing the new movies to the originbal series you need to see them as their own movie, you need to see them as the next chapater of the franchise, a franchise that is still growing, that is still gaining new fans. The new movies reach out to a new generation of fans, just like the original series did to us. I personally think its fantastic that Star Trek can go into new directions, take on new dimesions, and give new meaning to some of the most well known sci fi characters ever created. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Simon Pegg, Zoe Salender and the rest of the cast are doing such an amazing job with their given charcaters and should be credited for their hard work not slated by bunch of Trekkie Fans that are clearly still stuck in the past. Get over yourselves and welcome to the new world bitches!!!!",2016-03-16T09:52:03.000Z,1

I'm a bit skeptical over the lack of Abrams' directiorial involvement. However, there's a chance that Justin Lin, the director of two of the better Fast & Furious films, can do justice to this since he can finally embrace the opportunity to abandon some realism here since this is sci-fi and not silly street action. The guy can direct stunts like a fucking champion, let's see if he can carry that excitement into the reaches of space.

Yes, you can say it's not anything like the old Star Trek shows or films, because it isn't them. I personally enjoy these new movies, they have good acting and the cgi are incredible. But the purpose of an action movie is to entertain, first and foremost. The old tv shows were no different, but it was a tv show, which means they could go a lot more in depth with the Klingon or Borg. If you REALLY want something that can educate people, there are numerous documentaries on tv and dvd for you to watch that will do the same thing. If you think these movies are dumb and are for the narrow-minded, that's your opinion. You don't have to watch this movie.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Star Trek fans who hate the new movies have some valid criticisms, but the bitching and moaning about the new franchise in general is fucking pathetic. Okay, I agree that Into Darkness wasn't original, was annoying to watch, and didn't have many deep thematic elements that Star Trek usually has, but I liked the first Star Trek movie. I'm a fan of the TV shows, yet I like the new cast members because unlike most Trekkies, I accept that we are in different times. Star Trek is going to have more action because the typical philosophical material, while great, makes for a boring movie for general audiences. As sad as it is, the Star Trek fanbase isn't large enough to make for big box office numbers, and that doesn't cut it for a blockbuster film. The deeper themes can (and should) still be present, even if that means weaving a bit more action into the mix. The problem with Abrams is that while his first movie was perfect for reintroducing the characters and the franchise, basically doing the same thing for the second movie was where the criticisms that he shouldn't be handling Star Trek became valid. It's why he was perfect for directing The Force Awakens. He's good at pacing, visuals, energy, and at directing his actors, which makes him a great action movie director, but when it comes to deeper character stuff, I agree that it's better left in the hands of someone like Rian Johnson. Now, Jeremy Lin may not be that guy for this Star Trek movie, but Simon Pegg, a huge Star Trek fan, helped write the script for this movie. Everyone involved that's not Abrams (and maybe he finally knows why, too) knows that this movie needs to different. That's why, unlike the other virgin Trekkies, I'm giving this movie the chance it deserves. Good God. If you love the original shows so much, just watch them on repeat till you die and don't watch the new movies.",2016-02-23T03:41:01.000Z,0

The one thing I love about all these new space movies is that we are finally at a stage in cinema where technology allows us to better see and experience the ship side of things (not that the 60's version isn't cool too) but with TOS and TNG you know you're looking at CGI or model ship.

maybe movie execs don't have fully functional memories but I remember when people kicked up a shitstorm because Enterprise had a rock ballad for it's theme tune, so why you thought aggressive hip-hop rock was a good idea is BEYOND me.
Star Trek is already a tired, battered house wife as it is, this is just asking for the final curb stomp to finish the job.

What we needed to see in this trailer was why and how the universe pushes back at them. Where is the conflict? Who is the enemy and where is the struggle of our heroes?

Into Darkness was underwhelming. It's ultra liberal plot (fuck you Orci) combined with too many references to older movies/shows and messed up character development made it bad. The only good thing about it were the beautifully rendered action scenes.

Beyond looks like it has taken away those action scenes and made it a more.....non Trek approach. I can't comment on the movie itself as it isn't out yet. But what they should have done was make Trek bigger. For crying out loud, friggen V'Ger is out there somewhere. It wasn't affected by Nero. You could have made this movie about it. But no, let's just drop the entire crew on a planet, destroy the ship that is about 1/3 important to making a Trek movie, and add unnecessary X-Sports scenes.

This looks great! Please, do not listen to ""Trekkies"". They are insufferable, entitled, ignorant, and completely lack any literary or viewing comprehension. They are literally the worst fan base in existence. If they had their way, Star trek would be nothing but old men sitting around conference table endlessly discussing treaties and demilitarized zones. I am speaking as someone who used to consider themselves a ""Trekkie"". You'd do well to ignore them and don't worry about pleasing them, because you never will. Try to please everyone else, instead. Keep making Trek about a hopeful future, whilst making it more inclusive and accessible, as you have been.",2016-02-05T21:17:35.000Z,0

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"I think this movie is Beyond ""mindless action"".

Many of these comments are very biased towards this film and even previous films.  The first 2009 movie is a reboot that did a great job telling an original story.  Although it didn't go many places where no man has gone before it gave a sense of homage to the older series giving both the old and new trekkies/audience something to like and understand.  It's very clear that no one understood the meaning behind Into Darkness.  A sequel that focused on the Star Fleet losing their path since they were corrupted with revenge against Khan.   And Star Trek Beyond looks like they're giving what you all complained about from the last film, new worlds, new life, new adventures, etc...... So honestly what's the deal?  Is it simply because the movie is directed by Justin Lin?  Is it because you saw scenes in the trailer that had action in it?  Is that it?  It's too easy to criticize the work of a film without bothering to put yourselves in their place and see how it is like working with a production like this.  Not for just the director but for the other crew who work to make these films happen...  Not an easy job.  So far I haven't seen one legitimate reason why this film looks bad other than that it has ""mindless action"" and ""the music doesn't fit"".    Can't judge an entire movie because of one trailer.  We will have to wait and see how the film turns out when it hits theaters.",2016-01-17T02:01:06.000Z,1

Anniversary celebration film has settled it with me. I will not spend my money for a ticket NOR even watch the DVD. I'm done. Pegg/Lin and Jung have no idea what Star Trek even is. I mean if you want the new crew to stand on their own, let them do it in a non anniversary film. I mean this is the 50th Anniversary of Star Trek.  Robert Orci had it right, his story incorporated Nimoy and Shatner both. Since Nimoy is no longer around that is all the more reason for Shatner. No doubt this is no tribute fitting for Nimoy.  Paramount has no idea what they are doing to the franchise.  They have lost their core fan base and this excitement on the new movie will not last long. Plenty of good ideas to bring Shatner in it is there, everything from the Guardian of Forever to the ""echo"" left behind in the Nexus like Guinan mentioned about her.  I mean Nichols, Takei and the others could have made cameos, for God's sakes man, it is the 50 Anniversary celebration.

Saying its not Star Trek is fucking retarded if you think about it. Obviously you guys have not watched Star Trek since you were kids. when the show came out people loved it but at first every show and cartoon after people hated till they got used to it. Issue this time is this generations is a bunch of self rightious fucking morons saying they hate it but all will see it and all will buy it. STFU and dont judge till you see it. This is different from the original yes but so are the other fucking shows so next generations and every other one must not be Star Trek.,2016-01-07T16:31:02.000Z,1

Paramount/CBS have recently decided to file a lawsuit against a fan created feature length film called Star Trek Axanar. Despite their precedent of allowing and encouraging fan works to be created, Paramount/CBS has swept in well over a year after the Axanar project was created and crowd funded to call fowl. This is unfair, untimely, and stands against the precedent these companies established in regards to fan created material.

I hope all fans of the Star Trek universe will stand against the hypocrisy of Paramount/CBS. It doesn't help that their recent efforts with this franchise have been abysmal attempts to grab more money. Now they make a tyrannical sweep against a fan film that has a truer heart of Star Trek than any recent ""professional"" releases. Not to mention they file this suite not during the funding campaign, nor the release of the short Prelude to Axanar, but a mere 6 months before the release of the fan film and after significant expense has been spent on the part of Axanar Productions.",2016-01-01T23:03:34.000Z,0

This choice of music alone already is blasphemy for any long-time Star Trek fan. Beasty Boys are cool but don't fit for Star Trek at all. Where is the classical bombastic ouverture stuff used in Star Trek when it still was Star Trek? They are so focused on making ST 'hip', 'cool' and 'mainstream' that they turn it into a pure money-making abomination that would make Gene Roddenberry & Majel Barett turn in their graves. Sure, Roddenberry loved money too, but he always stayed true to his concept. I would be very excited to see Axanar being made, but CBS/Paramount got the full extent of the corrupted-by-greed IP and copyright laws on their side on that one. Very very sad indeed for the fans.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"It's amazing how many people on this comments thread are forgetting that most of the 12 previous Star Trek movies are action/adventure/comedy movies FIRST, and Star Trek movies SECOND.  The very best Star Trek movies IMO are Wrath of Khan and Undiscovered Country, yet those were the two movies that pissed off Roddenberry the most!  

The movie that perhaps most resembles Roddenberry's vision was The Motion Picture, which moves at a snail's pace.  I caught it again over Christmas and the scene where Kirk and Scotty approach the Enterprise is literally 5 minutes long.  It's the exact opposite of 'entertaining.'  

What I'm saying is: this movie is no different than all the other TOS, TNG and Reboot movies.  Every fan knows that Trek lives and breathes best on TV, but let's not kid ourselves: it's ALSO a thrill to see starships on the big screen too, with a budget that can generate truly alien worlds.  

This 90 second trailer is selling the spectacle but it seems to me that the film itself will really address, for the first time in any Trek movie, the dangers of going where no one has gone before.  I can only think of the TNG episode Q Who, where the crew first encounter the Borg, that similarly highlights the very real possibility that you'll eventually bump into something you can't handle.

I'm very much looking forward to seeing a film that fulfils the promise of the 2009 movie, whilst also the new TV show in development.",2015-12-31T12:34:29.000Z,0

It felt like fan-service, and the audiences gladly ate it up... Me included. Unfortunately, Mr. Lin, that theme doesn't bode well when it is used to pitch a movie.

Do you know what this trailer makes me feel like? It makes me feel like you're milking what Abrams re-imagined.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Huh.  I feel like I'm getting different things out of this trailer than everyone who sees only the action.  For me, I get three things.  One, humor - a kind of humor that I enjoy, which stems primarily from the eccentricities of the characters.  Two, the setting, which appears to be on an alien planet.  This, for me, goes back to the original movies and series quite well, and it's what I missed in the previous films.  Being stranded on an alien planet and having only their brains and their guts with them to figure out how to get off while also dealing with potentially hostile locals.  And three, a new, strong female character, of which I am always appreciative, especially in films.
I have always loved the various series and I grew up watching them, but I know I am not a real Trekkie like some, so can I ask respectfully what you guys disliked about the other new films (I read through some of the comments and saw quite a bit of hate on them)?  For me (I'm saying that a lot... haha~), I really enjoyed them.  I liked how they kept a number of the themes of the original without purely copying it and how they managed to combine action and high technology/SFX with character depth, humor, and a compelling plot/drama.  Which is all I can ask for in a good movie in general.",2015-12-27T15:08:22.000Z,0

This trailer shows the action packed fun side of the franchise where as the Into Darkness trailer showed the depressing and dark side.

Meant to entertain a new generation of fans, not satisfy the pining of an older generation of complainers.  3.  It's a divergent timeline!  What part of that concept do you fan zombies not understand?  4.  Think you can do a better job?  Then do so!  Quit bitching about something you had no hand or effort in creating. 5.  Enjoy the movie!  Have fun!  6.  Want to see something different?  Your choice to either watch it, or make something to your standards!

Seeing thought thinking films made by modern action directors, is almost like seeing Michel Bay directing Hamlet. It will be exciting but missing the complete point and be extremely watered down.


Thou I am aware the TV series was more like wrestling action with sci fi elements, at lest its doing what the creator wanted to make. A smart show for the masses to enjoy and see a brighter tomorrow to learn from. The show may not do well to be well written but it got more smarter on the films, So by saying that, star trek beyond would seem be like a complete joke, fun film but a joke.",2015-12-26T04:19:00.000Z,1

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"First of all, a trailer is only suppose to make us aware of the movie, NOT tell us what the movie is about.  Crew in danger, Enterprise destroyed, cool.  NOT Khan returns, damages the Enterprise, finds Genesis, tries to kill Kirk, submarine battle in space, Khan is beaten, Khan tries to destroy the Enterprise with Genesis, Spock sacrifices himself to save the ship.

We've all seen Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan, a cinematic masterpiece that few could ever top, that we can watch over and over again knowing full damn well about the emotionalism over Spock's heroic sacrifice and solid story with solid acting.  BUT guarded by the fact that Spock is going to return on the next movie.

BUT what so few seem to realize, or even spot because the new movies were not dumb down for them, is that they doubles the humour, tripled the action, and centupled the lens flare.... yes centupled is a real word, the very thing that makes Star Trek what it is is still very much present.  The only real difference is that the story and action are streamlined without stepping on each others toes, but the purists are tripping over their own feet as they try to keep up.

Poverty, disease and war are pretty much gone on Earth in the new movies.  It's the Enterprise not on a mission to save the people from Earth from their own undoing or restoring freedom to the Federation, but the Enterprise explore us, humanity.  Seeing our successes and failures, seeing ourselves as the crew of the Enterprise.  Seeing a world not as is, but seeing it what we want it to be.  Where we come together despite our differences not because of a common enemy, but a common goal.

They define Star Trek as much as wagon trails to the stars, and they are extremely easy to spot whether you are a simple movie goer, or a hard core Trekkie like me, who has been one for nearly 40 years.",2015-12-25T07:00:13.000Z,0

Star Trek had its action, of course, but generally it was a much bolder, more dramatic, slower paced style. More based around emotion and intrigue, rather than guns blazing, jumping into a firefight and rushing headfirst into combat. This is more like the stereotypical action movie rather than the stereotypical science fiction.


Look guys, the emphasis on cheesy action is awesome and all, but save that for another movie where it would actually fit. A sci-fi with that type of style has great potential and I'd like to see it executed well, but you still want Star Trek to resemble Star Trek.",2015-12-24T01:52:28.000Z,1

People, this is an alternate timeline, so there will be differences. We still don't know how many other races were affected by Nero's time-traveling shenanigans, and it might be more than we realize, which may contribute to all the action versus what we saw in the TV show.
Also, the fistfights and photon torpedoes from the TV show were probably exciting to the people way back then like this action is to us today (although taken down a few notches, I'll give you all that). And who knows? Maybe all of the action will be justified when we find out the plot, and maybe it won't. But don't forget, Pegg said that the trailer wasn't like the movie. You never know.
That said, I respect everyone's opinion. And as we all know, Star Trek has had its stupid moments. No one said that they'd be eliminated with the reboot.

Into Darkness actually got me to go to a movie theater, something I rarely do and even bought it on Blu-ray, Cumberbatch was tight as Khan, and the first one was sweet too and very rewatchable. So I'm not going to jump to conclusions that this is going to suck just because the douchebag from fast and furious got his hands on it. Star Wars sucks, it's campy as fuck with all the muppets and shit, and good vs. evil black and white mixed with the juvenile humor and cheapens bushido (and specifically iaido which I trained in for 8 months). 

Visuals do matter,  when it's actually combined with a great story, it's magic. We'll see if it sucks or not, but it's a teaser trailer, it's supposed to get your attention, especially with all the visual distractions around us these days.

This is Star Trek, key words being Star as in space and Trek as in travel. Not some random adventure on god knows what planet with some randomly generated alien fantasy girl. What the hell are those aliens supposed to be? I'd say the Hirogen but they looked better than that! You just cant introduce new aliens into Star Trek, especially in Kirk's time.

The trailer seems more focused on the action and thrills, rather than the actual essence of the story but I'm not one to judge too quickly. In fact, this is only the first trailer, so I'm a bit confused as to why there is already so much hate when others haven't even seen the actual film.

So here`s the plot:
Ship sent to investigate some plot / rebels / others who are a threat. Ship gets whacked and destroyed. Remaining crew make allies from rebels who are against main bad aliens. yada yada pop pop lensflare lensflare.

On Science: I remember being a 4 year old kid and wondering how to make transparent aluminum. I remember being 8 and wondering how fast data could count, I remember being 13 and reading about our early attempts at bio-organic technology because of Voyager, all of my scientific interest and my knowledge of computing I owe to these years.

On morality, ethics, and shades of grey: I remembered being 15 and being horrified at what Ben Sisko did to get the Romulans into the War, I was actually, utterly, shocked.  A scifi show, teaching a 15 year old boy about the devastating and compromised nature of war and its horrors. 

As for the intrigue: I miss wondering what was past the next star, who were the next new species, what was their culture, what was their history. I miss when star trek solved technical and social problems through investigation, analysis, and judgement, and every new character they met wasn't trying to kill everything.

I mean Christ, does anyone over in Hollywood actually give a crap about the core. Have we all forgotten these words so easily?

 Space: The final frontier.

 These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.

 Its ongoing mission:

 1)To explore strange new worlds

 2)To seek out new life and new civilizations

 3)To boldly go where no one has gone before.


Today it may as well be ""to boldy go somewhere relatively local and kick ass""

The same goes for all those who want there to be mainly intellectual material. In the end, though, can we take a moment to just stop arguing about how this looks like Fast and Furious in space or that they're happy that the old show is dead? Llet's all have respect for one another and move on. This is just a movie. Now before the hate starts, let me remind you that this is just a trailer. We have yet to see the full works. Maybe it has the right amount of both- which could very well happen as we have a new director. Maybe it won't. At the very least, let's wait until the movie comes out. And to those who's at that the trailers are there to spark discussion and that we didn't see anything but action and therefor there will be no intellect in this movie- would you put just talking in a trailer to draw people in to see a movie, or would you put the impactful material? I'll leave that to you. I bid you a due.",2015-12-20T05:42:47.000Z,0

But this trailer concerns me. I do not want Star Trek and its subsequent adaptations to become nothing more than Fast and Furious in Space. Of course some will say that JJ Abrams Star Treks were just that, but those have some emotional and philosophical complexity if you look closely, and they exemplify Kirk and Spock's brotherhood.  
I want to like this movie, but the trailer looks bad. Beastie Boys was a poor choice of music and it completely disregards the last part of Star Trek Into Darkness. What happened? Did they start their journey and get recalled or some BS? I realize the movie format is not as great as TV for the Exploration theme, but they could at least try something different than ""enterprise/earth in danger, must battle evil villain and nearly or completely destroy the Enterprise.""
All in all, I hope the movie proves me wrong, but this was a poor start for a movie that already has an army of detractors at its back.",2015-12-19T22:32:21.000Z,1

This is supposed to be in the fucking STAR TREK universe/time/whatever. Why the fuck are they using 2013's COMPUTER GAME LINGO? Are they fucking playing DOTA on the holoscreens, then yelling ""yo noob learn to play"" as well? 
Why the hell are they using fucking game/internet lingo in A FUCKING FUTURE ALTERNATE UNIVERSE WHERE HUMAN CIVILIZATION AND SOCIETY HAS EVOLVED TO AN INTERSTELLAR SPECIES............ Fuck.
This kind of lazy shit to ""connect with the audience"" is so fucking ridiculous.

Why not just fucking throw in a dumb god damn meme like ""LUL spock, your base are belong to us, noob""?
Why not? Same fucking thing, same exact thing. Just as god damn illfitting and ridiculous and makes no logical linguistic sense in the entire fucking setting of the movie.
Its like having the Dwarves in LOTR say ""Yo dawg toss me, i'll fuck em up, gangnam style!""

WHAT FUCKING RELEVANCE DOES THIS HAVE TO THE SETTING? You cant just fucking pull REAL LIFE CURRENT INTERNET CULTURE LINGO into a completely different fictional time period and setting, for fucking fucks god damn fucking sake!
God, the scriptwriters are so god damn moronic beyond belief, HOW do they get such high paying AAA jobs? Unbelievable.


0:42 THATS NOT FUNNY YOU DUMB SCRIPTWRITER FUCKS...
Sorry, lol. Just.. Jesus christ, how did they FUCK IT UP so badly?
And the music, and the scenes. The acting. The script, the fuckin dialogue..
""Dauyymmmn i'm suffering from mid-life crisis and will now attempt to make a HIP RADICAL movie to appeal to the YOUNG AUDIENCE""

No, just no. You fuckin failed. This doesnt appeal to anyone. This is as pathetic as a 55 year old dad trying to sing Britney Spears - Baby Hit Me One More Time in karaoke at his daughters prom night, to appear ""hip and cool"" for her friends.
How the fuck can they completely misunderstand, 1. What the fuck STAR TREK even is, and 2. What the fuck the young generation finds cool or interesting.
Because this is jack shit of either of the two. This is just pure fucking trash.

This is another Hollywood ""American Pie teenage angst movie"".
Fuck this, the ""new"" Star Trek reboot is dead. 
I'm going back to Season 1 Episode 1. It had far more balls and ""youth cool factor"" than this piece of grand-dad desperate-pathetic-attempt at being ""cool"" has. Fucking Kirk or Pickard, a bald aging man in spandex, has more cool factor and youth appeal than this fucking trailer has despite all the CGI and EXPLOSIONS and TITS.
Dont give a fuck about the tits, and im still a perverted horny mother fucker, let me tell you, still dont give a fuck about the tits in this movie, give me old granddad Pickard or Kirk anyday instead of this, at least they werent desperate mid-life-crisis fools trying to impress 13 year olds. They were real fuckin actors, real fuckin men. They weren't pretending to be anything they weren't.

JJ Abrams must be a virgin.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Beast Wars!! I mean... Star Trek! I remember the first official trailer for star trek 2009 was pretty much on this level of action movie tone and people were freaked out, then they released trailer 3? I think, which had a much more dramatic and serious and EPIC tone, which made people a lot happier. I really really don't think beastie boys was a good decision for a star trek trailer. It makes this movie look insecure about itself when it relies so heavily on referencing such a small aspect of a previous installment in order to boost it's appeal and marketability in such a generic way. They have a real opportunity to distance this installment from Abrams obvious Star Wars fetish he just couldn't resist shoving into the last two movies throughout, and I hope they take it in a direction Abrams couldn't or wouldn't, and embrace the plethora of content and ideas Trek has offered over the years and what made it special to begin with. Here I see the potential for a story about human ingenuity in a desperate situation, which, yeah, can be a platform for an interesting story if told right, just as many episodes of trek have done before in a similar way. The creators of this are clearly caught between capturing what made the abrams treks appealing, and what makes ALL the rest of Trek appealing, while telling a story the previous films didn't (presumably). not an easy spot to be in. I will say that Abrams had some really great ideas for the cinematography and ways the camera moved and flowed and framed shots,more so in the first movie especially. And overall I don't feel that I am seeing the same level of competence and artistry here in that regard. I have to be completely honest and just say too, this movie looks cheaper than the last two, way cheaper. From Chris Pines hair and makeup to the seemingly limited locations and overall toned down use of special effects and apparent lack of truly epic set pieces seen in previous films ( with the exception of whatever happens to the enterprise that shit looks serious), I'm definitely not getting the same vibe here that made the Abrams Treks appealing in their own right in terms of the epic scale and adventure. I just have to wait and see like everyone else, but I am sorta not thrilled about this so far.",2015-12-18T15:56:05.000Z,1

I find it kinda to be the marketing people saying, 'Everyone come see this film, it's full of action and fun.' When there is a lot more to it than that. I didn't love it because I know there is a lot more to the film. There's a lot more story and a lot more character stuff and a lot more of what I would call 'Star Trek stuff.'

You can keep the action, but it seems people are also ready to be challenged by the opportunities and implications of space.

Can we diversify the female roles in action movies just a tiny bit? its like the writers copied and pasted Michonne from the walking dead, then changed her outfit to avoid a lawsuit. And theres about a dozen others exactly like her. Get past the idea that a girl in a movie has to be either a hyper feminine love interest for one of the main characters, or a hyper masculine badass who still contributes almost nothing, and accept that you could just make them a regular damn character. Think if captain pike did everything he did in the first two movies, but was played by a girl. the movie would be NO DIFFERENT except that it would add variety to the classic ""mentor turned parental-figure helps out his favorite student"" shtick. I mean its not like kirk was introduced playing death metal in his bedroom, reading a copy of playboy magazine and wearing the equipment from 3 different sports at once, all while watching Black Hawk Down, because his gender isn't a focus of his character. his character focuses on his goofiness, strong sense of honor, friendship with spock, and ability to rise to any occasion. So if the main character can slide by without the movie throwing in our faces that he's a guy, why can't the same thing happen with the token female character

Oh and when Heath Ledger was announced as the Joker and world bemoaned Christiphoer's choice. How dare he cast a pretty blonde boy who has only had a handful of small films, in this iconic role. And then first trailer came out with some shots of the joker and we couldn't wait to see WTF Heath had done with this character. He looked amazingly sinister and fit for the role. And then the movie came out and the world crowned him the best Joker ever.

-The scene where scotty almost falls off the cliff is a rip off of the scene where kirk jumps out of the car in 2009.
-The scene where kirk is beamed while falling and lands on the transporter pad is a rip off of the scene where they disable the drill on Vulcan in 2009. 
- Pause on 0.55 they look like Jem H'adar?
- The fact that Enterprise gets raped by those flying things that are a rip off of Enders Game is too big a plot giveaway.
- That Albino alien chick is a rip off of the people on the planet in Into Darkness who are about to get raped by a Volcano

So, not only is not very trekky, it's not very original either as it steals scenes from 2009.

Star Trek should be fun, but it should never forget it's mission. The franchise looks like it's heading off course, which is a shame cos I love the cast, so much potential.

I know I'm the only person who likes the series, but Enterprise is now the only series that actually happened.

Back in the day I got attitude and refused to watch TNG from the start bcs it wasn't TOS. Then I watched and got totally hooked. When I thought about it, I kind of  realized I was going against everything Gene stood for. He wanted to challenge the world to allow things to evolve. Every series has had detractors and purists who rage against it and I can respect their love and defence but for ME I realized I was being foolishly unsupportive of exactly what Papa Gene was all about if I didn't give them a chance. Remember Elvis was the devil to one generation's parents and now he's considered tame as all hell. 
I say if Uncle George, Grandpa Nimoy and even The Shat could support the evolution I can keep an open mind. The worst would be a world without Trek to my heart. Wish it was back on TV.     :) LLAP peeps to each their own ♥",2015-12-17T00:57:18.000Z,0

For Pete's sake pull yourself together. Ok music is off and doesn't belog with the trailer but that doesn't mean that the whole movie will be bad. You don't know the strory behind it, neither character development. You just have bias toward it and you don't know anything. Yeah it's is utterly action-packed but that is a trailer. Scenes from the whole movie crammed in 1:34 minutes. That doesn't mean squat. Wait and see, than judge. 

I'm a big fan of Star Trek and although I love the original series and movies, and TNG, DS9 I don't think J.J. Abrams did bad job at all. In my opinion he did excellent job and albeit his movies don't depict the core values of Gene Roddenberry they are still great. New look, new vision that correlates with todays society. I like them so much that Star Trek 2009. is one of my favorite movies generally.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,I'm noticing more Trek than Star in this movie trailer and that doesn't inspire me. Don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with having planet based stuff but 90% of this trailer appears to be planet based and that was one of my biggest problems with Insurrection was that to my recollection (haven't watched it in years) it mainly took place planet side and that contributed to it being a weaker movie.

1. the music: it's just doing a callback to the first movie. It's not like the entire soundtrack will be this maybe one or two songs but mostly orchestra if the movie comes out and is all rock music then please complain the hell outta it. haha 

2. that Justin Lin doesn't understand star trek.... that is extremely hypocritical for some of you to say cause 
- most of the people that watch the new star treks never watched the old ones
- also JJ Abrams hated the old star trek when he took on making the first movie 


3. last complaint that is stupid. the movie looks to action packed...... so does the reboot and into darkness. welcome to modern day star trek where there is a lot of action hahaha.

The second in command, and has two sex androids whom he calls friends, but because their brains were differently than a positronic one, and its hard to tell if the robots have free will or not, he has legal ownership over them, causing division among the crew.  After being forced to place stricter limitations on using the holodeck, the captain is working with available counselors to stop ""portable holodeck"" addiction among members of the crew, with failed success; there are posters on the wall urging people to seek help; people are becoming disenchanted with some of the decisions of those in charge and a few aren't showing up to their posts.  A stranded vessel gets picked up who are travelling merchants who seem both rich and seedy, and refuse to discuss what their cargo is, causing it to go on lockdown.  The captain agrees to take them back to their home since its on the way, but its later found out that they are illegal weapon dealers and the enterprise is taking them to their customers.  The old scientist is reclusive and has been seen dragging a tall crate into the holodeck every night, what nobody knows is that the crate contains a child borg, and the samples he is actually trying to obtain are not from a planet.",2015-12-16T08:50:39.000Z,0

To justify the cost movie companies want big movies. It's funny, after the 2009 movie came out people online were screaming for the villain of the next movie to be Kahn. The writers listened and then those very people reversed course and HATED IT! Now a trailer comes out for the next movie and suddenly everyone seems to be able to tell if it's good or bad from a few minute commercial for the the flick. Star Trek like Bond will live on even if the original actors, writer and producers aren't involved anymore, and to try to keep new people coming in they will change the course of Star Trek. Paramount used to scrimp on ST's budget, now they throw nearly 200 million at the screen and they expect some return, so instead of bitching about how much you hate, be thankful you still can go to a theater and see it every few years. Even if it isn't to your liking, at least it's still there.",2015-12-16T05:24:09.000Z,0

When you play a song by the Beastie Boys (which really dates a movie) it makes it seem more forgettable. Star Trek is intelligence, leadership, big ideas and great challenges to overcome by a hard working crew. All I got out of this trailer was badly placed music with a bunch of show off stunts. What is the big issue here other than the ship being destroyed...again. So far this has a focus on destruction. I don't see any deep character moments.

On the big screen, you are going to need to have heavy, gritty action and drama to satisfy today's attention spans. However, the Martian was quite capable of doing just that. Star Trek is very beloved because of its philosophical and exploratory nature. The reason I have had a problem with JJ is that he doesn't care about Star Trek and has a profound disconnect with it. He made action films and tried to piece together relationships in a flimsy manner. The writers he chose were not any better. The two movies come off as soulless and hackneyed scripted action films. There isn't anything that makes me  really enjoy and love these characters as I have from the TV Series.  Star Trek films have never been completely strong. The later TNG movies after First Contact were abominable. I didn't even like Enterprise the TV series at first but then when I did a front to back watching of Trek I fell in love with it. If you wanted gritty action with many philosophical underpinnings - you had it in that show. Star Trek is a beautiful world of very thoughtful characters and political, philosophical and humanistic proportions. It's why I feel so strongly about it and it's preservation. It isn't mere nostalgia. I am a kid of the late 70s. I grew up with TNG. I saw TOS later. I don't respect JJ for what he has done to Star Trek.",2015-12-16T01:30:50.000Z,2

I for one love the new star trek movies, they brought a lot of new ideas to the series and while it's certainly not as deep as the shows.. it's not supposed to be.

Quit being so butthurt and be happy the story continues.

Seriously. This is becoming a joke. Studios are trying to repeat the succes of other franchises. This looks more like a Marvel movie or a Fast and Furious movie than an actual Star Trek movie. Why not stay true to what you are and build something incredible out of that? Not everything has to be an action movie. I LOVE action movies but I'm getting sick of this.

Might just be alluding to that film via that song because this is the first film in the new series to have a new director. JJ Abrams went on to do Star Wars 7. The director of Fast and Furious did this new Beyond film. I never watched those films, not my cup of tea, but chances are someone made a call to put that song in this trailer as a through back to the first film.

I can't stand it; you financed it!
I'm gonna set it straight, this Trek debate.
Explosions enough to make Mike Bay leer.
The flagship ain’t a ride on Top Gear!
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this Vulcan thorn in my side,
Every cutscene a ridiculous barrage,
Star Trek’s legacy: it's sabotaged.

Listen up; got the wrong franchise, son!
You say a trailer for Wars is just good fun?
Keep diluting the dream and I’m gone
faster than fans of rebooted Tron.
'Cause what fans want to see, we don’t get.
Claim that we’re stubborn with all our frets,
but you mistake mockery for homage.
Star Trek’s legacy: it's sabotaged.

A nod to Shakespeare, not at all?
Listen all of y'all; it's sabotage.
I’m cryin’ green blood; it's sabotage.
Our legacy; it’s been sabotaged.
Star Trek’s legacy is sabotaged.

I can't stand it; give the audience some credit.
Makes me irate; this mindless future fate.
Room for both carbonite and corbomite in space,
so ethics, hope, and allegory needs its place.
Keep making mistakes and I’ll go all pon farr,
Opening a Khan of rage hot as a class 0 star.
Pierced Klingons, it’s sabotage!
Cashing in on a dream - that's sabotage.",2015-12-15T22:17:30.000Z,0

Who says an action movie can't be cerebral? I like this trailer because it doesn't give away any of the plot. If you had a trailer that was promoting the more cerebral aspect of the film then it would have to give away big chunks of the plot and will likely alienate a large portion of viewers (remember this is a summer blockbuster intended to make money). A cerebral action movie is the pop-culuter equivalent of a philosophical thought experiment. Consider the classic though experiment, a train is about to hit and kill 12 people, you have the power to divert the train to a different track that will only kill 1 person. Do you divert the train and actively kill or do nothing and allow 12 people to die? Imagine if they made that into a movie, it would be action packed and cerebral at the same time.",2015-12-15T21:53:06.000Z,0

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"TO BRIAN

I was surprised to read that when Brian got married he was not aware that his wife was very , very wealthy.


 In fact he said on the Steve Kane show years ago which is on TALK SHOE  that he didn't know until a few weeks after he was married he hit the money load..well he didn't say that ..


A few weeks later he bought a brand new Mini cooper and got rid of a broken down VW.bug that was on the side of the road more than on the road, 

So all this crap about how he worked for everything he has is BS.

 He went from living behind Sears to a Plantation and at the time was a wealthy area. 


They both did separate Tax returns because Brian made so little money, that he received a tax refund. The fact is, Brian hit the money load whether he knew it before or 6 weeks after being married as he stated is not relevant.

 He mocks people that really work and makes it like he has everything because HE worked for it.. NOT true at all

That's why AL is banned from the show because he found out the truth and that why Brian wont take his calls.. But he tells everyone he not scared of any callers. 

He scared of folks finding out he worked for nothing he has..Only helped spend the wife's money.",2015-12-15T21:23:59.000Z,0

And it looks from all the dislikes alot of people agree. Yes Star Trek was always about exploring planets and the crew overcoming various perils. But this just isn't Star Trek! Trying to turn a classy science fiction franchise into an intense action franchise. Definitely looks more like Fast & Furious than Star Trek, thanks Justin Lin....",2015-12-15T20:25:26.000Z,0

Well, in not to long we'll know if the price was worth it. If STAR WARS The Force Awakens is as good as i hope it is then yeah throwing STAR TREK is worth it any day. But if The Force Awakens is a epic fail... Well then i'm going to be pretty darn pissed. And i'll get pissed at STAR TREK and hate on it because no matter what happens i'm a STAR WARS fanboy and therefor can't let myself hate on it no matter what they do wrong. Prais Jar Jar!!!! But for reals tough... This trailer wasn't any good. I mean like what the fuck happened? STAR TREK was actually pretty darn good! And INTO DARKNESS just blew me away! Having never really liked STAR TREK that's saying alot! Both the past films where great. But this doesn't seem great. They lose the ship.... That's one BIG fail. The style of the film is... Well it isn't really good in my opinion. Where are the lense flairs? And what the heck is the plot of this film? A albino fights them and then they join forces against Dr. Evilfish and win using the Bike of Awesomeness? Sorry... I'm not going to judge the film based on the trailer. But the trailer dosn't make it look any good. This just looks sad. The very first trailer doesn't have to be the best trailer. But if it fails to give a good impression then that's a flop... The first trailer has the most riding on it. This one failed in my eyes. Let's hope it's just a bad trailer and the movies isn't as bad.",2015-12-15T20:23:30.000Z,0

Movies like this don't create cold followings and this is just a travesty that it gets made.  At least when this cancer spreads to television it will be swiftly canceled if it's complete shit.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Okay kids, settle down and let me explain why J.J. Abrams is a genius.
Star Trek, while being the hyper-generic ""Dungeons and Dragons"" of science fiction, was always made exclusively for this super-niche audience. Star Trek was made by talented artists and intelligent nerds, and that's wonderful. Kudos. However, it always lacked 1 thing: A director who just wanted to make a good movie. THAT is what Star Trek has always lacked. The best Star Trek movies were always ones where the director decided to do something different and add a little flavor that wasn't there before. Star Trek is bland. Let's face it. And let me explain what I mean.
I loved Prometheus. Dense, complex and deep writing don't bother me. I loved 2001: Space Oddessy. Really slow pacing to set the tone doesn't bother me. What I don't like about Star Trek is that it's always been very bland. No personality. It was so generic, yet so inexpressive that each episode/movie just felt like a generic smoothie of science fictiony/Star Trekky stuff.
This fundamental flaw is the very thing that J.J. Abrams immediately keyed in on and corrected. Yes his films have various internal flaws, but no script is truly perfect. 
Just take this for what it is and try to enjoy it. J.J. hasn't let us down yet, let's just go with it and try to have some fun for the first time in 50 years.",2015-12-15T18:50:10.000Z,0

I was very excited when Star Trek 2009 was coming out because we had not seen anything Star Trek in a very long time. It was okay but disappointed me, I hated how they completely changed everything about the timeline like Vulan being destroyed. When Into Darkness came out I was, more or less excited but it turned out to be good. One thing I thing we need to remember is Star Trek is about EXPLORATION, Not fighting wars. I was excited to hear about the new Star trek Beyond, because I heard it was supposed to be about exploration. Let me just say, they trailer made me cringe. I can't even tell what the hell it's about. But it is yet another movie where the Enterprise gets destroyed, and they have to fight.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Summary of the comments:

Fans: I want more of the same old shit that made for a dichotomy of terrible and good movies flip flopping like crazy and episodes that make less then no sense.

Movie Makers: Sure, here's a new spin on the Kirk origin story keeping most of the details fairly correct.

Fans: ARGH! THIS IS TERRIBLE!

Movie Makers: Ok, here's a sequel which pays homage to the movie you morons claim is the best, Wrath of Khan.

Fans: ARGH! THIS IS TERRIBLE.

Movie Makers: FINE FUCK IT! Here's a completely new movie that has nothing to do with the original series or movies at all except for the crew and the ship. And we're going to destroy the ship so you can't piss and moan about that anymore. In fact, we're going to make this movie so hard core about the people that we're going to introduce a warring faction of natives to this new world with the Enterprise being caught between, and likely needing to help settle the conflict, that in effect we're going back to TNG style Star Trek (the best Star Trek).

Fans: ARGH! THIS IS TERRIBLE.


Seriously. Listen to yourselves. You are just the worst kinds of fans. You're asking for movies that are exactly like the originals. News flash: The original movies all sucked. ALL of them. It wasn't until TNG that any Star Trek movie wasn't a complete ball of pure garbage.

And that's largely in part to the fact that Kirk is just straight up the worst Captain ever. He's basically James Bond in space. Which is terrible.",2015-12-15T18:22:41.000Z,2

I've seen ever single Star Trek/Wars related film, T.V episode, series, books etc... There is very little I don't know about in either of these incredible universes. What I can tell you is this; some movies will be better than others based on the methodology to reach different people covering different opinions and views. Not every movie made by either franchise can win all people's hearts and vote. What I do know is this, each time another movie is made, more and more people are aware of these universes hence more money for the creators and franchises. These movies provide jobs and entertainment = plain and simple.  I for one couldn't care or less for this trailer as compared to the Force Awakens trailer - two completely different levels of WOW factor for me personally. At the end of day, die hard fans will pick apart everything they want and they have every right too as they are fans. At the beginning of the next day, who gives a shit.

Times change, people change and the world has moved on since William Shatners bad overacting, Patrick Stewarts slow and drawn out thoughtful (boring) Picard (people know him for playing Charles Xavier in the x-men movies despite spending decades playing Picard on TV and in movies...). Grow up, move on, get a life and accept change. It happens. So these new versions aren't like the old films/tv shows, I bet you have them all on DVD/Blu-ray? If so go watch them and nostalgiate (is that a word? Or have I made it up?) over them and leave the rest of who have enjoyed these films to enjoy them in peace.

I'm grasping at straws, I like the trailer but I wasn't floored by it like I wanted to be.",2015-12-15T09:07:24.000Z,0

I mean, the Enterprise fired ""everything we got"" at a disabled romulan ship... whoop de shit. The 2nd movie, the Enterprise didn't fire a single shot. Both times it got owned.

I like to believe that I am objective enough to be able to see things (films especially) from different perspectives. And, although I do find that these new films aren't ""ye old Trek,"" they still do offer some decent entertainment. Whereas the old shows delved deep into thought-provoking topics/themes, these new films just graze the surface while being injected with plenty of spectacle as substitution. And, from this trailer anyhow, this one does not seem to be slowing down in that trend. So, we'll have to wait and see just how much the ""surface to substance"" ratio has been affected before I decide on how I will feel about the new films going forward.

Are the new films bad? No, they aren't. They are entertaining. Are they as good as (or better than) ANYTHING Trek that has come previously? Definitely not. However, they are still good enough to watch and enjoy.",2015-12-15T06:59:53.000Z,0

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"The first line of the opening crawl is ""Luke Skywalker has disappeared.""
 
The first sentence in the movie is ""This will begin to make things right"", said by Max von Sydow. Poe Dameron came to him to get the map to Luke Skywalker for The Resistance.
 
Max von Sydow's role is just a cameo, he has about 10 sentences before Kylo Ren kills him.
 
The Empire is now The First Order, The Rebels are now The Resistance, more extreme fraction of the New Republic, who are supposedly pussies. We only see the New Republic planet for a few seconds before it's destroyed by the Starkiller base.
 
Almost no one in the movie believes that Jedis and Luke Skywalker ever existed.
 
Kylo Ren captures Poe and uses the Force to stop laser blast so that it remains floating in the air, frozen in place.
 
Finn helps captured Poe to escape from the Star Destroyer only because he cannot pilot TIE fighter himself. Poe is an expert pilot, Finn can shoot lasers. They become friends.
 
Finn's ""real name"" is FN and four numbers. Poe starts to call him ""Finn"" because it's easier to pronounce. FN likes it.
 
After 20 minutes, we are supposed to think that Poe Dameron was killed in the TIE crash on Jakku. He reappers near the end (he ejected before the crash) to lead the attack on Starkiller base. He is not in the film very much. Finn wears Poe's jacket during most of the movie.
 
Rey meets Finn, they steal the Millennium Falcon from the junkyard and fly away. Han and Chewie catch them soon, followed by two groups of racially-stereotyped space gangsters.
 
Chewbacca is wounded by space gangsters soon after he appears and spends most of the remaining time doing nothing. Rey takes his place as Falcon's pilot, proving herself to Han.
 
Kylo Ren is Han and Leia's son. He is ""Master of The Knights of Ren"" but it's not explained what it means.
 
Kylo Ren's real name is Ben. He was trained by Luke but then turned to the Dark Side which was the reason for Luke blaming himself and disappearing.
 
The Starkiller base charges by draining suns and then destroys whole solar systems. The shot in trailer with Kylo Ren and red flare is the Starkiller base firing. Guess what, the Starkiller base can be destroyed by flying in her trench and shooting the ""oscillator"" or whatever.
 
Han meets Kylo at the Starkiller base/planet and tries to persuade him to return with him. ""I am torn apart, father. But I know what I must do. Can you help me?"" - ""Of course, my son."" They almost embrace. Kylo pierces Han with lightsaber. ""Thank you, father."" Dead Han falls into the shaft on the Starkiller base. Yes, he is dead. Most definitely.
 
Leader Snoke is the bald CGI bad guy with large scar across his face. He has snake-like movements but his body is never clearly seen. His motivation or origin is never explained. He gives orders to Kylo Ren and General Hux (who hate each other). Most of the characters don't know about Snoke's existence.
 
General Hux has screaming monologue in front of thousands of Stormtroopers: ""We stand upon this mighty weapon you've built. Everyone will bow to The First Order. Today will be remembered as the last day of The Republic!"" Afterwards, all Stormtroopers raise their fists. Very nice Der Fuhrer moment.
 
Fan service: Holochess. The levitating training ball from Episode 4. Admiral Ackbar. Rey living in the AT-AT wreckage. ""1138"" mentioned. Garbage chute and trash compactor mentioned. Kesel Run mentioned.
 
Simon Pegg plays an alien called Ankar Plutt who took care of Rey when she was very little and her parents disappeared. Now he runs a junkyard on Jakku and buys scrap from Rey. His face and voice is not recognizable.
 
Apart from Han and Chewie, all the ""original characters"" (Leia, R2D2, C3PO) only appear after two thirds of the movie, when The Resistance lands on Maz Kanata's planet.
 
Maz Kanata (small CGI gypsy) is the new Yoda and explains everything cryptically. Nobody understands her.
 
Han and Leia see each other for the first time after many, many years and have a touching conversation about their son: ""You can still save him."" / ""How can I save him when Luke couldn't?"" / ""Luke was a Jedi, your are his father.""
 
Kylo Ren and Rey have duel of wills. Rey wins, telling Kylo: ""I sense your fear. You are afraid that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader.""
 
Kylo Ren talks to Vader's helmet: ""Show me the darkness. I will finish what you started, grandfather.""
 
R2D2 spends the whole movie powered down and doesn't do anything until 5 minutes at the very end when it's discovered that crucial part of the Skywalker map is in his memory, probably but there by Luke long time ago. (It's not very clear but Luke appears with R2D2 in a flashback.)
 
Rey has a weird dream/flashback after she finds Luke's lightsaber in Maz Kanata's castle and touches it. The dream contains lots of quick imagery and short voiceovers by Yoda and Obi-Wan. Several famous shots in trailers (Kylo and his posse, Luke's mechanical arm on R2D2) are from this dream montage and are never explained in the movie.
 
Finn's origin (his skin color, who are his parents, why he hates the First Order) is never explained.
 
C3PO's red hand is never explained. In fact, there are many things that are never explained in this movie...
 
Both Finn and Rey have lightsaber duel with Kylo in the forest on the Starkiller planet/base. Finn is badly wounded and spends rest of the movie in a coma. Rey finally falls in love with him. (He loved her from the first sight.)
 
Starkiller base/planet is succesfully destroyed by The Resistance. We don't know what happens with Kylo Ren (who was there) but he probably survived. Snoke sends the message to Hux to ""Bring Kylo Ren to me complete his training.""
 
The last sentence of the movie is ""May the Force be with you"", said by Leia to Rey.
 
After the last sentence, there is an extended sequence without dialogue: Rey leaves the Resistance base in the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca. They find remote planet where Luke is hiding (because they now have the map), Rey goes to the ""first Jedi Temple"" (which looks like ruins of some Scottish castle on a rocky island). Luke is there, dressed in old Obi-Wan style hood. Rey returns his sword to him. Apart from this sequence, Luke only appears for three seconds in Rey's previous flashback. Luke speaks no words in the whole movie and is onscreen maybe for 30 seconds total. He never meets anyone else than Rey.",2015-12-15T06:44:03.000Z,2

Trek fans are used to being punched in the face but this seems a bit more below the belt. 

The only reason star trek has survived 5 decades is because of the fans, and how do you reward millions of fans who have supported Star Trek for 50 years?
Take everything about it that they love out, or (to paraphrase Simon Pegg) ""make it less Star Trek-y"".

This wont be a Star Trek Movie. This will be a Guardians of the Fast and Furious Movie staring the characters of Star Trek.

Paramount are trying to appeal to a different audience by (pardon the pun) alienating the audience they already have. The greatest asset with Star Trek fans is they are fiercely loyal, and have stuck with the franchise for generations (that one was intentional). They host podcasts, dress up as characters, have heated debates about canon and the next generation (ok, ill stop now) of star trek fans will do the same. 

This different audience that paramount are trying to appeal to are fickle, short attention span types who tend to forget about something the moment something newer and shinier comes out. These people wont stick with Star Trek for another 50 years even if they do enjoy it, and lets be honest, the fast and furious types are not exactly famed for their enjoyment of all things Trekkie.",2015-12-15T06:34:37.000Z,0

Most of those storytelling wise were very very poor. But because you're fan boys you don't want anything new that's not the original. NEWS FLASH you cant make the originals anymore they wouldn't make it in todays media. You do realize that there hasn't been a new Star Trek show for a while now right? There's a reason for that. JJ Abrams put a new spin and much need breath of life to the series.

The new films are great on their own.  Good story telling, great action, great effects, good humour, just all-round good films.  But every last real Trek fan is either content with the original series, or wants a new Prime universe TV Show.  With about 25% (give or take 10%) of fans still waiting for a redo for the end of Enterprise plus a film.  And a film for the Voyager crew.  ...and something DS9-related.

The reboot I think caught me and a lot of people by surprise.  It took chances, rebooted the series and tried to update it.
the sequel was good but served a bit ""dark Knightish""?
this one seems like a Guardians of the Galaxy vibe.

mostly what I'm feeling is a sense that they think this series will never end.  It feels a bit cocky like they know we're gonna see it.

But there's nothing really wrong here...if anything their finally branching off from the original series from what I can tell.

@Mr. Justin Lin: If you read this. Please, give me a chance to do the trailer stuff for you. I don't charge any money, but lets do it the right way. What i've seen here shuttered my heart to the ground as a guy who cuts movies for life and with passion and  love.

@Mr. Abrams: If you read this. I was one of the remaining guys playing your Star Trek ARG, ending up with a video message from the late Mr. Nimoy. I played it, because i trusted you. I already see that Star Wars: The Force Awakens is going to be a good thing.

Why in all god's heaven are you guys producing Star Trek: The Phantom Menance, Star Trek: Attack of the Clones and now Star Trek: Revenge of the Sith? Why Star Trek fans, nerds, geeks and dogs don't the Star Trek: The Force Awakens. What is the difference.

If there is a problem on communication between ""What is Star Trek"" and ""I don't know what to do with it..so lets add some brainless characters and action"" - then better hand it over to people loving Star Trek. Get people on board who spend a lifetime living and loving Star Trek. The new crew is fine..but why you're sending these poor guys on a ""5 year, then the franchise is dead"" trip?

1. Timing in comedy that only 5 year Olds will enjoy (spock leaving Mccoy on his own to die) 

2. Obvious sex sounds when they are not needed. 

3. Ground vehicle chases instead if star ship chase. 

4. The destruction of the enterprise in only the third movie

5. Over zealous hand to hand combat. And we will most likely have a lot of that. 

6. And and if this trailer tells us anything, they will most likely market this to middle schoolers. 

I don't know if this will be a bad thing. But with Abrams taking in star wars. The star trek franchise gets taken by a different director who has a different vision of star trek. I'm not too happy Abrams isent directing this.....  :(",2015-12-15T04:49:14.000Z,0

It does not have any in my opinion be (!), but when the film is so like the trailer, then but everything is not a Star Trek more, right?
 Where is the Prime Directive, where is the friction with her? Where the ""more analytical"" scenes in which remain one can come to think, and where there is neither action nor music (well with the latter I can even put up: D). That this is not happening in the first two films is not as serious as they have taken a lot of temporal stimulus at which rejoice StarTrekFans I konnten- me too!
 But now that the story really Star Trek should be liable only, I miss the real ""polynuclear"" and above all was the message hiter of Star Trek.
Star Trek has never been a lot of action. I order they are received, but slowly it gets too much. I hardly think that- the film should be so as feared - it the Kirk, Picard, Sisco, Janeway, or Archers particularly pleased ...",2015-12-15T04:02:50.000Z,0

Ok, yes...this makes me angry, but first let me say this. The 2009 Trek was good and I quite enjoyed it. Why? Because whomever was heading it up was aware of the rampant fans if they messed it up. So they made a plot point that would satisfy us. Aka...and alternate universe. They took great care in casting and even did some wonderful nods to TOS.

That being said...what in the heck makes them think that this is Star Trek?????

Star Trek is so much more than an action-packed flick (or at least that's how it was created it be!)

If you are truly interested in the heart of Star Trek watch these episodes of the various series and skip this wannabe movie. Really disappointed with what I just saw!

The Original Series: ""Let that be your last battlefield""

The Next Generation: ""The measure of a man""

Deep Space Nine: ""Past tense"" parts 1 & 2",2015-12-15T03:47:54.000Z,0

Seems exactly in line with most of the other movies to me. The highest grossing star trek movie involved them saving whales.

It's a return to exploring the frontier, which is at the heart of Star Trek.

I'm not going to judge a probably 2 hour movie right now on one 1 1/2 minute clip. It looks like an entertaining ride, and I choose to remain hopeful.

Gone are the days where Star Trek was intelligent, thought provoking, ahead of its time. This is not the Star Trek of The Next generation, Deep Space 9 and Voyager  know. It is a caricature of Star Trek where flashy scenes. camera glares and sexy, good looking individuals get to be flashy and sexy and make bold choices and throw around trek jargon every 2 seconds to remind us that this is, in fact, a Star Trek production,  but it's not just like any Star Trek - this is a hip Star Trek.

Maybe it is just a really bad trailer, but it looks like Star Trek has lost its way.  It looks like any other action movie with Star Trek characters and back story splattered on top.  The characters are just the rudimentary traits of the originals without the depth.  Star Trek always had humanity and the traits of science fiction in the story lines, this just looks like a run-of-the mill Hollywood action film. Hopefully I am wrong and this is just a badly edited trailer. If not, someone needs to rescue Star Trek.",2015-12-15T02:52:35.000Z,0

I know a lot of people enjoyed the high brow attitude which Star Trek has developed but I just can't help loving this new focus on action. The best part of Star Trek: Into Darkness for me was the last 20 minutes when the Enterprise got blasted into swiss cheese, Spock wrecks Kahn on the back of a speeding hovercraft, and Kirk takes one for the team. Scottie and Bones were hilarious throughout. If I'm ever feeling the need to watch a bunch of stuffed shirts bumble through life while helplessly struggling against their personal demons I'd just spend more time at my job.

The JJ Abrams films were nothing like the old Trek films to begin with, so raging over this one a bit silly. I expect there will be the same drama, villainy and story as the in the last two films.

This trailer is a poor follow up to yesterday's explosive Independence Day trailer that is getting people excited and hyped for the sequel (which is quite a feat since virtually no one asked for a sequel to begin with), unlike this trailer that has left people dumbfounded and uninterested.  Honestly, I have zero interest in seeing this film because I absolutely hate this trailer.  Motocross jumps, karate kicks, over the top stunts (especially from Scotty, of all characters), Jesus Christ...what happened to this franchise?!

Here's the thing, I'm not against action and adventure in a Star Trek film, it can be done!  Look at Star Trek: First Contact; this film pulls off being an excellent sci-fi action film without losing touch with the Star Trek franchise.  Star Trek Beyond, from what I've read in the trade press, and from what I've seen in this trailer, is nothing more than another dumb action movie that's part of the Star Trek brand in name only.

No suspense either, just immediately introduces us to the Star Trek characters and next thing you know, a bunch of random explosion crap things happening. In terms of direction, this movie looks well directed and will probably have some pretty sweet action sequences, but the movie's tone and writing look AWFUL.

Do they even bother with screenplay writers any more?
Or is the goal simply a montage of fun, visual moments and cute lines.
Producers, you can still have subtlety, depth & nuanced ideas, characters & genuine emotions with sci-fi action.
But let's not bother, let's make a dumbed-down bromance buddy action flick.
I'm surprised Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill aren't in it.
I predict fun, meaningless action with numerous plot errors & character inconsistencies. And hot chicks!
But we'll include the manufactured emotion of a quiet, ""serious"" scene (with sombre music).

I can completely understand why this movie might look bad. I would most definitely blame the editing team behind this trailer because it's god-awful. Doesn't feel right. Feels not only too different from the other movies, but there's no tension, no true climax as the music is blaring the entire time. The movie looks eh, it looks like the actors are in a set honestly and 0:34 looks extremely fake (still, the movie hasn't finished it's effects) and it looks almost exactly like that scene from Furious 7. That can be fixed though but what needs the most work is color correction to me, some parts are too bright and colorful (Yes, I know they're in the jungle/ forest). The best part is the very beginning, before they crash on the planet.

You haven't even seen the goddamn movie yet, and you're already condemning the makers of it! Guess what dipshits...this is the same fucking song that was in the first movie (that everyone now claims to love), and it's the same level of action  (so far) that was in the second movie, (which everyone initially liked, but not all of a sudden hates despite the fact that it's a better story than the first one). 

Too exciting? Too much action? Too much good music? These are some of the most asinine complaints (from a TRAILER no less) that I've ever heard. If you brought this complaint to any other film, the person sitting next to you would probably slap you. But because it's ""Star Trek"" it has to be super intellectual ONLY, and make no references to pop culture? Please! Go back to 1966 if this looks too much for you. The rest of the world (not just Star Trek fans, but film fans in general) will want to see this precisely because of the elements you (and the one critic so far) is complaining about.",2015-12-15T01:06:38.000Z,0

You want to attract people with an intriguing mystery? Leave the score silent and dub some eerie dialogue from the movie over your cuts.  

You want to convey a ""this might be the END"" vibe?  Stick with low tones, sweeping cello and bass, or go the Inception route and do the plunging BWAAAAAAA's over epic wide angle shots.  

You want to show that your movie is just a mindless action romp they won't remember the next day?  That's when you slap 8,000 action shots together in quick succession and dub over everything with an extraordinarily cliche pop song.

This is basic shit, guy.  So I have to assume you put this laughable ""teaser"" together in this way because there wasn't enough substance in the film to convey any other tone.  If I'm wrong, prove it Paramount.",2015-12-15T01:01:18.000Z,1

Technological resources for big budget action were very scarce, and it's even been openly admitted that a lot of the tv show (especially the first have of season 1) was met with a lot of close calls deadline-wise (i.e. The Menagerie parts 1 and 2 being the saving grace period that allowed them to catch up with the project, look it up). I wouldn't be entirely convinced if someone tried to tell me that Gene Roddenberry would be terribly opposed to having JJ Abrams and/or Justin Lin.

The original Star Trek films are old and slow, sure, us old school Star Trek fans love those shows and SOME of those movies, but take off your rose-tinted nostalgia glasses for one fucking second and think; think for one goddamn second that an old style Star Trek movie would alienate a ton of viewers that want a fun summer action movie. They don't want to bring in entirely old audiences, they want new people to start loving the series as well, so why can't you be fucking happy that this series is acting as a gateway for new fans? But you know what? If you want Star Trek to die by confusing new fans with a slow ass pace and a boring movie, you go right ahead but me, personally, I want Star Trek to live on and get more and more popular. So if you don't like the new Star Trek, shut the fuck up and go watch TNG for the billion and first time.

The alien ships at 1:00 look very similar in design to Reptilian Xindi ships, just smaller. The white female alien could very well be a Primate Xindi (the way her hair is style is a bit similar to how theirs was in Enterprise). And the alien at 1:10 could potentially be an Arboreal Xindi. The swarm-like attacks could indicate some kind of Insectoid Xindi tactic. Didn't see any Aquatics or Aerials.

Almost certainly a Xindi storyline. It looks like maybe in this timeline there is some kind of Xindi Civil War? Perhaps the Reptilians (and maybe Insectoids) are now attacking Earth, after subjugating the other Xindi species.",2015-12-15T00:37:27.000Z,0

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,I am glad i am not the only one disappointed by this trailer. I was waiting for this trailer to come out for so long and this was a huge let down.  I love Star Trek and the fact that they are making movies but this trailer is extremely disappointing. I am such a huge Star Trek fan that i would never write anything about it but this trailer  makes me cautious about how this movie will turn out.   This does not have the heart and emotions of the first two movies. I am all for action in Star Trek Movies but this seems like Star Trek Fast and Furious.  I know the director  directed  Fast and Furious but i mean come on did you have to use the same  style in Star Trek. I am really disappointed by this first trailer and i hope it is better then what it looks like what it would be.  I will still go to see this movie as a Star Trek fan but i hope i am not disappointed like everyone else.   I hope people like me dont wish JJ Abrams  was back at directing this. I am truly disappointed by this trailer.,2015-12-15T00:04:15.000Z,0

Star trek has always had humor in it, and sometimes there are some goofy or silly moments, but that's what makes it great too. The last two movies were very serious, and I'm sure this one will still be, but what's wrong with it being a little lighter this time? And what's wrong with it being like Guardians of the Galaxy anyway? That movie was awesome! To me it reminds me of TOS, and if you like that, then this I think pays some homage to the more comedic side of Star Trek.

Take a look at Star Trek: First Contact.

First Contact had action. Five minutes in, and we're already seeing a Borg Cube taking out ships by the second. Then we see a bombing, a firefight, a fight aboard a starship, another firefight, etc. We even see Picard with a goddamn tommy gun.

But the thing was, First Contact also had a story, and nuanced messages. We got two new, dynamic characters introduced, we got backstory for the world we know and love, we learned old flaws of our favorite characters, and we felt for them. They did action, they did science, they did drama, and *NONE OF IT WAS BORING*. It was a smart movie, but like this, it was accessible to everyone as long as they knew the characters.

Everyone loved it. It's still the 4th-highest-grossing Trek movie yet, including the reboots, and it almost made double its budget. The film buffs enjoyed the direction and themes, the mass audience ate up the action, and the nerds had all the technobabble and continuity they could want.

It's too early to judge Beyond, but it just seems generic and dumbed-down, even for the reboot. The trailer has a couple cool shots, and the bit with Bones is pretty funny, but that's all I'm seeing. I'm not mad about it, but I'm getting tired of what we're getting, and I think the audiences are too.",2015-12-14T23:52:40.000Z,21

That said, after watching a few times to really absorb the content.  Minus horribly picked music.  This does look closer to TOS Trek.  You have the crew on a planet, dealing with a predicament.  People are saying something about Guardians, over the alien girl?  There was also an alien girl in old trek.  Almost every time, and Kirk was always the one romancing her with a few small exceptions.  Except in this day and age, the girl is not just there to be a pretty face.  She actually does things relevant to the plot.  

I've actually got some hope for this.  The last two were not that bad either, but certainly the feel is different.  This will be closer.. give it a chance guys.  And try to ignore that stupid trailer.  It's clearly designed to market to the younger, short attention span and blow everything up crowd.

JJ was out, we could have gone back to our roots... sadly they went completely wrong direction... a Star Trek movie where you destroy the ENTERPRISE in the first act... just for the sake of making a generic bullshit action movie... man... there are no more words...",2015-12-14T23:39:23.000Z,1

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Every line in this trailer seems to be either a platitude or a quippy one-liner followed by an explosion, and it's giving me second-hand embarrassment.  This one, like its two predecessors, seems to be another punishment of Ex$plo$ive Blockbu$ter $chlock.  Star Trek used to be defined by its interest in social reform, non-violent problem solving, and publicly approachable philosophy.  

The Original Series had the first ever nationally televised interracial kiss, TNG challenged gender norms by having men wear mini dresses and by writing episodes with obvious LGBT parallels, Voyager made a point to include a richly diverse cast and a female captain, DS9 had a black commander, a gender fluid main character, and often wrote episodes that explored the devastation and aftermath of war.  

Meanwhile, the new movies have a whopping total of two people of color in the main cast, a white-washed Kahn, three total named female characters who have lines (all of whom have appeared partially naked).   Zero gay couples, zero trans people, zero disabled characters, and a huge emphasis on violent ""problem solving"". I can't believe it's 2015 and this huge budget series is ethically straggling behind a schmaltzy TV show written in the 60s.

Star Trek is supposed to be political and intelligent, so if you don't want to make a Star Trek movie, then stop pretending to make them.",2015-12-14T23:36:56.000Z,0

The ""don't watch it"" is the only weapon left in the Trek fandom to stop these embarrassments. They harm the franchise by reducing the value and message of what Star Trek is to a younger audience.  I know from the conventions Star Trek fans are upset about the current films. There are not enough ""young new"" fans to bring in the money Paramount expects or needs to keep making these movies; the success of these movies still depends upon the long term Star Trek loyalists. The last movie barely broke even for what the studio spent. I know the feeling of obligation, we Star Trek fans feel, to to see everything Trek. But, at a minimum, stay away for the first two weeks of release. This is the period the studio makes the most money, without sharing with the theaters. That is enough to send a true message and stop production of these special effect extravaganza, no substance, shadows of Star Trek.",2015-12-14T23:26:06.000Z,10

That's a plus, but it doesn't have a star trek feel. The first two movie trailers weren't action packed and it still held a certain, awe to it. This trailer, with the music choice (which might be why I feel this way), kind of makes me feel like I should put on some leather, grab a couple guns and get ready to kick some a$$. Not something I should feel when watching Star Trek. Especially since I avoid action movies due to the redundancy (unless it's marvel). I will reserve final judgment. There's a lot of trailers that show all the actiony parts in the trailer and the rest of the movie doesn't have that. So it's possible that this is one of those times. Also with lowered expectations, I might enjoy it more. But I went into Darkness (I know a lot of people hated that one) with high expectations, and I loved it so much, I got into TOS.  Til now I held the reboot and TOS separate  in my likes. The main reason being that the reboot had yet to go on the five year mission and doing its own thing. This is changing that. Lets pray, they don't screw it up.",2015-12-14T23:23:44.000Z,0

And they have to live in a mad max type world where resources are scarce as resources come from crashing ships.  I'm sure they end up ""building"" a ship out of various wreckage and use that to escape/fight back.  They are probably fighting the planets auto defense system or they are fighting a race that attacks everything that comes near so they can steal their technology.  I can get with the story line.  But they could of picked a better director.  5 big budget movies to his credit, and none of them are very good.  But maybe it will be good, I'm sure I will watch it and probably enjoy it. It would be nice if it was memorable and amazing though.  You can't blame or credit the director for everything.",2015-12-14T22:53:01.000Z,0

I don't have a problem with a action, however this doesn't even feel like Star Trek. I'm just hoping the silly marketing is covering up something special.

My biggest problem is that after two films I still don't give a crap about the characters. Why would i care about them doing anything now? This is why star trek died more than a decade ago, the characters became secondary to the plot. The bad thing is that this film might be great and no one will see it because in the last film Spock of all people decided to punch his emotions out.

Star Trek is a great franchise that i love, but it doesn't have the strength of Star Wars, nor its blind fan,s to endure complete madness and survive. Of course the first Avengers trailer was terrible too and the second made it amazing. We will see.",2015-12-14T22:52:25.000Z,0

That fits specifically with the original Star Trek show lol) BUT, if the whole movie is too action-y, which this trailer is making it look like, that would totally take away from the Star Trek feel. A good amount of action, sure, but it can't be like your usual summer action blockbuster lol And THEN we have Sabotage by Beastie Boys playing throughout the ENTIRE trailer! I love the song myself, but playing it for more than a bit in a Star Trek trailer takes away from the feel AGAIN. Ugh...let's hope this is all because the TRAILER was mad kinda badly for any sort of ""fan"" of Star Trek, and not the whole movie. Let's hope for it to be a marketing ploy, guys, come on!

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"It does finally seem at least less villain-focused than the past three films. It looks a bit more like it's shooting for something along the lines of Insurrection or Star Trek V, in that we do get to see an alien civilization and some kind of revolt perhaps, though hopefully better executed than in those films. It looks lighter and a bit more problem-solving than villain-killing, so it looks promising. I'm cautiously optimistic that this might finally feel a bit more like TV Trek, but with movie Trek action and over-sized emotion.

I noticed Orci, McKay, and Payne are still listed as writers.  Perhaps there influence is still there, including Orci's wish that the film move away from villains.

I hope Elba's playing more of an antagonist that meets Kirk halfway, and it ends in a truce with both sides having a better understanding of the other, like in the best Trek stories.",2015-12-14T22:03:44.000Z,0

But I have to say, something that I disliked very much about the last two films were how much they seemed to just take place on, or near, earth.
I craved seeing them explore to find NEW WORLDS and NEW CIVILIZATIONS and this film, finally addresses that.
There appears to be no bastardization of an older plot-line. This is essentially just a single episode of the original show, turned into a movie. With way too much action. I have more hope for this film than it seems like most other do.",2015-12-14T22:01:34.000Z,0

OK so i bloody loves Star Trek way more than Star Wars (and believe my the Star Wars hype is real) but this trailer was so disgusting. I dont think any of the crew of this film have seen a single episode of original Trek.  Why do they have to blow the bloody Enterprise up every film dont they understand that the Enterprise is supposed to be as much of a character as Kirk not just some plot device to be blown up every 5 seconds, also the Enterprise is the Federation Flagship how can a bunch of asteroids disable it (apparently their is no such thing as navigational shields i mean what is the point of having a navigational deflector if it cant deflect...). Honestly i dont even think i will see this at the cinema and put all the money i save into Axanar as that ""Fan Film"" looks amazing and if you haven't seen it you should watch Prelude to Axanar. Leonard Nimoy would be turning in his grave at this, God bless him. 

anyway rant over go watch Axanar

Im not 100% sure if its because of the music choice, the scene choices or what it is, but while im trying to be hopeful im not sure what to think

The cast is great, id watch it just for them but... i dont know what to think. 

I understand the original star trek is too slow for the new age of cinema, but nothing beats an incredible story and im really doubting this one has one, i know its just a trailer but damn i hate to say ive never been so taken back in a bad way by a star trek movie.

i really truly hope im wrong but damn im so full of mixed thoughts.",2015-12-14T21:22:43.000Z,0

He believed  that everyone will be able to live a life in peace  in the future. And as if we don't aleready have enough violence and conflicts on earth, we even need to make this franchise more violent with generic action and fighting. I saw a documentary featuring a guy from motorola saying that Star Trek inspired him to create the first mobile phone. A generic action based plot with an established IP  built around it won't accomplish something so awesome like that. And to anyone who says: Well Star Trek wasn't for everyone and now they wan't everyone to be able to enjoy it. Well then someone is doing his job wrong, I think it's possible to produce an interessting/intelligent movie most people enjoy! It's not easy, but if you can accomplish that you have created a piece of art not an generic commercial throaway product.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Movies are meant to look good through trailers. If you want to create any hope of having people be interested in your movie, you need to make a trailer that at least seems somewhat appealing to the viewer. This trailer was horribly edited. I am a filmmaker and an editor myself, and I can easily tell you that whoever made this trailer knew nothing about what they were doing. 

For one, the music. The music fits horribly for this trailer. It's not bad music, but it just doesn't help to set things up. Maybe for another one they could've done something with it. It's not necessary that they set the film up with a dark tone or something like that. The trailer should've been longer (two minutes, no less) and set up the film more.  Speaking of which, that's the second problem -  the trailer is so short. It sets up nothing about the film and only leaves the viewer confused - that's exactly how I feel right now. Granted, they shouldn't give away the entire film, like the Batman vs. Superman trailer did. But here they just didn't buff up the trailer enough. It's a complete hit and miss. And lastly, as of now, the movie just doesn't look good. The opening of the trailer could've been a buildup to something bigger, but the entire thing wound up being a bunch of random action shots that amounted to nothing. So that's why a third of the ratings are dislikes, because it is most certainly a horrible trailer.",2015-12-14T21:01:38.000Z,1

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"To all those people who are complaining about this movie, be thankful that there is even a movie that somewhat relates to Star Trek.  TMP sucked, Search for Spock wasn't great, The Final Frontier was a joke, Insurrection bombed,  Nemesis seemed like a rushed way to send off the TNG crew, then TV Shows... DS9 was a little too preachy, Enterprise mucked things up and just as it was getting good it got killed unceremoniously.  

Unfortunately Star Trek in it's original intended form is not a money maker and studios only care about money - they don't care what Roddenberry's vision was.  They aren't going to drop a dime on anything that they don't think will make money and as much as it hurts fans to admit it, the Star Trek movies prior to this JJverse reboot/refit/remake/sequel series weren't money makers and were not well received by anyone other than Trek fans which in the eyes of the studio mean limited return on investment. 

I watch the old stuff in the comfort of my home no problem and enjoy it, but I'll take these Action movies even if you could essentially replace the costumes and character names and end up with a Guardians of the Galaxy movie - which would still be awesome.

Take what you can get - or just go off and watch the Stupid looking remake of Ghostbusters with a crappy 80s Ectomobile, Stupid looking proton packs strapped onto the cast of Bridesmaid.  (Funny actresses who I do like, but I'm having a hell of a time seeing them as Ghostbusters)


Oh and if you don't like the JJverse, at least you can be satisfied that the enormously oversized Enterprise which dwarfed Galaxy class ships appears to be destroyed in this one.",2015-12-14T20:59:20.000Z,0

On the other hand.....WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!!!! Enterprise is getting destroyed again but this time it seems that it is happening at the start or the early portion of the movie, so obviously this director doesn't realize that the enterprise has always been one of the characters of the movies. There's a reason it's been the ship in EVERY movie. Why is there a dirt bike in space. His motorcycle and the (hovercycle? Ooooh patent pending!!!) were so cool, but no because this crappy director is in love with all things gas powered we get treated to an old fashioned dirt bike?! 

Star Trek has driven technology for the last 50 years or so, the last movies despite their flaws reminded me of that feeling I got as a child when they showed the enterprise. This?! This reminds me of why I didn't go see fast and the furious 2-infinity. Maybe it's a bad trailer, but if they were hoping to get Trekkies? FAIL.",2015-12-14T20:48:07.000Z,2

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"Judging from my guess of the plot and the handful of scenes shown, it's possible that this is the closest movie to a TOS episode we've ever seen. 

It seems as if they're exploring deep space, encounter some kind of crazy swarm that attacks the ship, and the crew ends up forced to crash-land somewhere by this mystery swarm. They run into some other unknown aliens who have suffered the same fate and with no resources have to try and figure out the mystery. Through cooperation, diplomacy, and heroic action they eventually save the day despite limited resources. That's pretty damn TOS sounding. I wouldn't be surprised though if the aliens turned out to be maybe humans from the future in some kind of weird time travel plot twist or something. Too few details given to really tell.

The music and editing makes this seem like a modern day Guardians of the Galaxy type of popcorn action film, but given the trailer's presence in front of Star Wars I'm sure they're just hyping it up for a mainstream audience. That's not the type of trailer I really wanted to see, but given the financial realities here I get it.

I was surprised to read that when Brian got married he was not aware that his wife was very , very wealthy.


 In fact he said on the Steve Kane show years ago which is on TALK SHOE  that he didn't know until a few weeks after he was married he hit the money load..well he didn't say that ..


A few weeks later he bought a brand new Mini cooper and got rid of a broken down VW.bug that was on the side of the road more than on the road, 

So all this crap about how he worked for everything he has is BS.

 He went from living behind Sears to a Plantation and at the time was a wealthy area. 


They both did separate Tax returns because Brian made so little money, that he received a tax refund. The fact is, Brian hit the money load whether he knew it before or 6 weeks after being married as he stated is not relevant.

 He mocks people that really work and makes it like he has everything because HE worked for it.. NOT true at all

That's why AL is banned from the show because he found out the truth and that why Brian wont take his calls.. But he tells everyone he not scared of any callers. 

He scared of folks finding out he worked for nothing he has..Only helped spend the wife's money.",2015-12-14T19:34:30.000Z,0

What a piece of shit. I mean, I feel horrible that I had to watch this trailer in order to make this comment. But I did it to demonstrate its dreadfulness and I forced myself to listen to it just so that you don't have to. So you should thank me for telling you to stay away from this horrible, steaming pile of goat shit.

Star Trek Beyond?! More like Star Trek Into Piece of Dog shit! This trailer is diarrhea coming out of my dick! This trailer is as appealing as a fucking ooze-infested dirty fucking sewer rat shit! I've had more fun playing with dog turds! Clings on my ass and photons my cock! This trailer is an inside-out asshole regurgitating putrid anal fecal matter! I'd rather fucking yank all the hairs out of my scrotum! I'd rather drink diarrhea vomited out of a buffalo's anus! It sucking fucks, it fucking sucks, it fucking blows, it's a piece of shit... and I don't like it.

The choice between watching this trailer OR watching The Star Wars Holiday Special is like.. say you're standing in a pool full of piss all the way up to your neck. Then somebody comes in with a bucket full of shit to dump on your head. Do you duck down under the piss by just listening to the album? Or do you just go to the gig, stand up and take on the shit? This album is like a cruel joke that you play on your friends. It's like, ""Hey, you wanna see the new Star Trek trailer?! Here you go, you fuckers!""

How about solving problems, that isnt just about shooting and killing stuff.

If this trailer isn’t just a decoy (like Batman’s nightmare on BvS trailer), my guess is that this movie will be the end of the franchise… but I honestly want to believe this is just a joke from Simon Pegg… and the movie has a completely different tone…
For other fans (like me ) who loved the original series and the next generation, I have a few questions:
1 -Why show us the destruction of the Enterprise? (I’m not comfortable  with that)
2 – Why ground the crew on a planet... to face different challenges and adventures?  (I’m still waiting for the regular adventures… “Space the final frontier” isn’t that the promise?)
3 – Who are those aliens? The visual reminds me more like SciFi’s Defiance mixed with Babylon 5

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"What the fuck did I just watch?
...

So I've had a few minutes to digest this; rather than anger, this trailer literally made me sad because I know for sure that no new Star Trek movie or show will ever again be made with Star Trek fans in mind. The first one was fun, but was more Star Wars than Star Trek. Into Darkness was just a mashing of previously used Star Trek ideas stuffed into remake wrapping paper and was less Star Wars and more Action Movie in Space.

I'm not afraid of change, or something new. Give me something new. But think of it like this:

What if Star Wars were made to into a dry, political drama in which Jedi were little more than diplomats being sent out on missions to settle trade route negotiations, characters with no personalities and muddled motivations were to take the place of a coherent story, and real sets and characters were to be replaced with sterile, green-screened recreations of the people and places they were meant to depict?

This seems too ADHD to me unlike the others that was subtle and ominous. Justin Lin was chosen as director i mean he's not terrible director but he was not the right choice for Star Trek. I heard rumors they were going to try and make Beyond feel like Guardians of the Galaxy but that's not what Star Trek is it's supposed to be collected and calm not outlawish. I like however this trailer didn't show too much but still think ot was kinda quick to understand what's going on.

I get it, they gotta move on to the 1701-A just like the original, but I'm tired of ""We can't do anything to them captain!""

Even the Borg were done well (though that came pretty close a few times).  This modern ""odds massively against us"" stuff... it's just turning me off.

Gene Roddenberry before he passed, there's even behind the scenes interview with him on Next Generation here on YouTube when it began, he said he wasn't sure where Next Gen would take us, but the #1 rule is there must be a Trek. It carries mankind's innate instinct to explore! to go where no man has gone before! what's out there? He set clear rules for the entire franchise the #1 rule that can't be broken is there must be a trek, exploration. I would almost believe if Gene were alive today he'd never allow this crap and the last couple crappy next gen movies to be made.

for all its flaws First Contact should have been the last, we got to see the creation of what became the federation, and took care of Borg. Gene's best villain he ever created. The early Borg were badass scary. After Gene died and the Queen introduced it ""humanized"" the Borg and fucked them up.

-The team is back in space, at the far reaches.. (classic)
-The film takes place stranded on an alien planet (classic)
-Everyone is getting in on the adventure, instead of just Spock (classic)
-The villain is something new, and exciting instead of Human (classic)


I think the fun, action packed trailer is what ruins it for some people... granted this is our first look at the movie... the 2nd trailer for all we know might be dark, with an epic score... this is meant to grasp people seeing STAR WARS (the darkest, most epic film of the year) They want audiences to think, HEY that looks fun! I love the Star Trek films!

Star Trek Darkness (which I think is F'n amazing, and underrated) was very dark.. nothing like the fun ride we had in 2009.. this is going back to that... with Pine, and Quinto confirmed for Trek 4 I think this is a perfect time to be fun, and have a good time, while having a terrifying villain (Idris Elba looks sick awesome).. and then return to an extremely dark, extremely serious film in the sequel Star Trek 4 (Klingon war maybe?)

*The only thing I'm upset about is the absence of Alice Eve <3 Carol Marcus...* I was extremely excited to see Kirk/Carol relationship further explored (pun intended)... hopefully they say what happened to her... and bring her back for Trek 4.",2015-12-14T18:32:48.000Z,0

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"No one has any idea what Gene would say about the new movies, and in reality it wouldn't matter anyway.  I for one am grateful for Gene's original vison of ""wagon train to the stars""  and his ideals of what a possible future of mankind could be.  But I also remember that Gene was the inventor, the idealist, but much other Star Trek ideas came from the writing staff and set designers.  Gene took credit for everything, just as many people's boss's take credit in the weekly meetings.  But he didn't do it all by himself.  I find it ironic how people hold such high regard for a man that couldn't even keep his dick in his pants like any respectable man/husband/father should.  There is no honor in cheating as far as I'm concerned.  
I love his ideals of a greater future,  but I could give a shit less what he'd think of what the Star Trek franchise has become.  
I'll take anything these people will dish out because behind all the action is still the basic ideals of the Federation of Planets and even though the man that invented those ideas wasn't worthy of them himself,  they are still splendid ideas.  
I also believe many people have forgotten how much cheese was in the original series.  Sure there were some great episodes in TOS, but STNG, Voyager and Enterprise were a hell of a lot better as a whole.  DS9 had great moments aside from the ignorant religious overtone.  Several of the original series movies were great, I enjoyed all of them but First Contact STNG was by far the best ST movie with The wrath of Kahn coming in a very close second, neither of which used original ideals because both used a Shakespearian base.  I guess we should just thank Shakespeare for the two best Star Trek movies!  
To end this ridiculous rant I have to say that if you naysayers don't like these movies, as is obvious by your comments,  then by all means don't fucking watch them! Stay home, put TOS on Netflix and enjoy what once was, inside your precious little bubble :P",2015-12-14T18:14:52.000Z,0

Seriously, in the original series there was action from time to time but they didn't base whole episodes around it.

There were loads of new discoveries, new planets, new races and new cultures; here we get some of the new planets, races and cultures but we had enough war and action in the last two films.

What is it with these movies and constantly destroying the Enterprise?

Fuck it, i'm done with any hopes of Paramount producing anything thats actually Star Trek. Maybe stop trying so hard to make it like the MCU, stop trying to court the lowest common denominators with every movie - You've alienated the core trek fanbase with each movie and destroyed everything that makes Star Trek, Star Trek. 

No offence to the actors, who actually DO make a damn good crew, but the writing is just low-effort bollocks and the studio might as well have hired Michael fucking Bay to do it.",2015-12-14T17:37:24.000Z,0

It looks awesome... some Star Trek fans will be angry about that, but at least Star Trek is still alive. I completely understand the fear of popularising the franchise, but Star Trek fans have to do the sums. The new Star Trek films have increased the fanbase by between 30 to 50% which means that the films will continue to be made, however, the fanbase remains small enough that Star Trek is still the least popular of all the current cinema franchises. Don't worry Star Trek fans, the average person on the street still thinks that you are sad for liking Star Trek, which is a wonderful thing. Embrace it.  I know I do...and i say that as someone who has been a fan of the films for the last 25 years.",2015-12-14T17:24:32.000Z,0

 So, if you don't like the next trailer+the final result, but the(much) younger audiences really like and enjoy it and then this film generates much money(and halfway good critics), you'll have to ""adapt"", or see your good ol STAR TREK go extinct, to make way for this.You can't change it or do anything about it, it will overrun you, or comfort you.

I'm not opposed to action at all. Loved the first one. Liked the second. But there has to be some story and character and at least one thoughtful science fictiony idea in the mix to make it Trek.

2015-12-14T16:03:45.000Z,XRVD32rnzOw,Star Trek Beyond - Trailer (2016) - Paramount Pictures,"TO BRIAN

I was surprised to read that when Brian got married he was not aware that his wife was very , very wealthy.


 In fact he said on the Steve Kane show years ago which is on TALK SHOE  that he didn't know until a few weeks after he was married he hit the money load..well he didn't say that ..


A few weeks later he bought a brand new Mini cooper and got rid of a broken down VW.bug that was on the side of the road more than on the road, 

So all this crap about how he worked for everything he has is BS.

 He went from living behind Sears to a Plantation and at the time was a wealthy area. 


They both did separate Tax returns because Brian made so little money, that he received a tax refund. The fact is, Brian hit the money load whether he knew it before or 6 weeks after being married as he stated is not relevant.

 He mocks people that really work and makes it like he has everything because HE worked for it.. NOT true at all

That's why AL is banned from the show because he found out the truth and that why Brian wont take his calls.. But he tells everyone he not scared of any callers. 

He scared of folks finding out he worked for nothing he has..Only helped spend the wife's money.",2015-12-14T17:16:39.000Z,0

I will, hand-on-heart, defend the 2009 movie to my dying day. It was fine then because they were getting a foot in the door to revamp the franchise, they gave us an enjoyable ride and set the stage for weightier, more faithful installments to come thereafter (with the whole alternate timeline idea), but now it's almost 2016 where we *do* have the kind of fun space adventures Star Trek 09 was initially making up for the lack of. Now in a world where Guardians is a huge hit with audiences, and Star Wars is returning in a couple days, it's time to let Star Trek be Star Trek. I'll go for the cast, I'll go for the action, I'll go for the visuals, I'm sure I'll even enjoy myself..
