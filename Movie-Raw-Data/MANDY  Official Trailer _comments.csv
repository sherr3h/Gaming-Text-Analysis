This was refreshing from the mainstream horror genre except Quiet Place as that was also something as both are something different than another remake (despite i enjoyed Child's Play remake), another ghost film, another found footage movie or another reboot/sequel/prequel/remake to an already dead horse franchise that needs to die already like Saw or Elm Street or Hellraiser etc.",2019-08-24T02:46:03.000Z,0

The story at the beginning intrigued me, but as the movie went on, it got simpler and simpler. It really could have used one or two more strong revisions to the writing up front, because some of the themes had a lot of potential. So it was worth watching I suppose, but it could have been so much more. The soundtrack was intense and had a unique tone.

Combine Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Crow, Heavy Metal, and stoner rock music videos, then simplify the plot, and add a lot of drugs, smoke, fog, and colored lighting.

A work of pure fantasy. The lack of law enforcement officers or government bureaucracy gave it an extra apocalyptic feel. Moral of the story: Don't mess with a lumberjack. And maybe don't read fantasy books involving volcano sacrifices and imagery---or they will come to life for real. Maybe the biker gang characters were a bit over the top. It was great to see Bill Duke (the old black guy in the mobile home) from the original Predator movie thirty years ago...one of his lines I believe from Predator was ""I'll bleed you. Real quiet.

I remember all my life
Raining down as cold as ice
A shadow of a man
A face through a window
Crying in the night
The night goes into
Morning, just another day
Happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes
I see a memory
I never realized
How happy you made me, oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy
I'm standing on the edge of time
Walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears are in my eyes
And nothing is rhyming, oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
And you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy
Yesterday's a dream
I face the morning
Crying on a breeze
The pain is calling, oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy
Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today, oh Mandy
Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away, oh Mandy

Besides his acting, and the main antagonists acting, the whole movie was garbage. I can't for the life of me figure out how it's getting good reviews. With all the psychedelic lsd nonsense in this, it seems like some one wanted a 70's or 80's movie right down to the bad soundtrack. I want my two hours back. 

P.S. Nicolas Cage, you did great, just find better roles. :)",2018-11-02T10:43:10.000Z,0

I also saw Beyond the Black Rainbow by Panos and if you liked this movie, go and watch it too! 
For me, Beyond the Black Rainbow is a little bit better, because it is more, I don't know how to say this, transcendece.
Anyways, Mandy is just unbelivably beautifully shot. The lightning is phenomenal. Every shot is crafted with so much passion. I wonder if Panos used real lights for the flare effects. I would compare Panos to Nicolas Winding Refn, both directors creating their own, unique movie style, using coloring and lighting to the max.

I watched it, and its complete utter trash. the beginning is mystical allegory that is rendered meaningless because of no context( which may be the point). the plot is basically this. some hippie physchos kidnap him and his girlfriend after summoning 3 bikers. they burn her alive, he wakes up and hunts them down and kills them. that's literally it. theres 2 instances of a cartoon depicting mandy. this film I sso fucking horrible its disgusting. im a huge fan of pychadelic surreal dark film, and this is a disgrace. all the components don't work. the plot is meaningless, and there is literaly no connection to anything in the film. the scene where he cries and tries to grieve mandies death isn't believable. the film is literaly him just waking up drinking bad lsd and killing this cult. its sad and pathetic. the fact this has a 90% + score on Metacritic is evidence the rest of the world are fools.  the beach with leo dicaprio is a film that's a better representation of surreal nihilism. this is just a physchadelic mesh of nonsense and violence. its short meaningless nonsense. the violence  and fight scenes are underwhelming. its a disgrace.  if you want nihilism then watch the beach",2018-09-20T00:09:47.000Z,0

2018-06-27T15:59:13.000Z,rI054ow6KJk,MANDY - Official Trailer,"Mandy: Reviewed By A Christian

I watched this most recent Nick Cage movie, expecting more sanity then I got. In place of what I read in a description (without watching the previews) I got a psychedelic psychology trip-out, attempt, which failed to hide it's anti-Christian attack.

Two lines stand out to a believer once the initial trauma wares off.

One is a scene where he goes off to get his crossbow from an old friend.

""What you huntin?"" his friend inquires.
""Jesus, freaks!"" the sobbing, Cage, replies.

The other was earlier in the film just before: (Spoiler) I wont go there...

The leader of the Manson Family rejects says: ""You know what Christ's biggest mistake was? He didn't offer up a sacrifice in his stead. The cruciform is a constant reminder of that.""

This is the stupidest thing ever uttered about, Christ Jesus.

Number one is ""biggest mistake"", implying multiple mistakes in the perfect witness of Christ.

Secondly, ""offer up a sacrifice in his stead"", for what? Jesus, didn't offer himself to save himself. There was no need to erase sin in a sinless life. He went to the cross for me and every other sinner born into the inescapable trap of sin and death.

Once again a movie producer in Unholywood, shows how ignorant they are of salvation and the industry there agrees they should run with it on high octane.

Not to mention this was blatantly a cult depiction we were dealing with and that true Christian's would be appalled by the action of that cult. Though the movie seems to try and throw it off as an example of Christian insanity. To leave it purely in the twisted psychological realm. That acid trips when mixed with Cristian craziness create unspeakable evil.

In truth, we aren't just watching Satanism in action. Only staunch Luciferian's would openly decide to mock the cross with such horrid actions. Because they're fully aware who they truly serve. A lying pretender, and the father of it.

Why not put on one more imaginary display of what isn't the truth? It's church for the anti-church.

It doesn't go unnoticed by idiots of the faith like myself.

Nor does it escape the utter genius of my Lord God.

Anyway, loved the movie aside from those idiot lines accusing Jesus. The Slayer and Sabbath shirt's looked great on, Mandy.

i find it funny to see guys that never ever watched Beyond the Black Rainbow being excited / hyped for Mandy....
Im a HUGE long time fan of his father work (The Mission & TombStone)  and have seen BTBR as soon it was available on the web.  Panos is THE coming director that ive patiently waited for years , he have a unique dark flavor but most importantly a truly personal VISION...an Aestical EYE for the picture that became too rare in this poor age of Marvel/DC/Disney Greenscreen era.  I would have highly prefered that he change the abrupt ending of BTBR and make a part II of it ....but its sadly impossible.  I know just by the look of Mandy that Panos is still ""connected"" with his Authenticity and wish him to continue this path and have great success among more and more cinephiles & genuine 7th Art Affectionados around the world.   From what i can see he can clearly be the next Kubrick of this decade.",2018-06-30T23:48:17.000Z,0
