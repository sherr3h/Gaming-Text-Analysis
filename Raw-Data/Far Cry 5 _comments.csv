And it's not an alt-right cult, cause there's white, hispanic, black and other ethnicities in Eden's gate.


Buy it, you will have lots of fun playing it through! I think it's really worth the money. The scenery is beautiful, there's alot of things to do and the story was enjoyable.",2019-07-27T11:02:12.000Z,5

They took out so much cool stuff like hunting to get new weapon holsters and other things to craft from animal skins. Not sure if they took out collecting plants and herbs. (instead its a perk now). No more knife take down kills (instead kills with hands when doing a take down). No more vehicle take downs like in FC4. No more weather effects like Rain, thunder, and lighting. No more cool animations of ripping bullets out of the characters hand when you run out of Med-Kits. If it is'nt broke dont fix it!!!!

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"Poor game. I'm a big far cry fan, (its probably my favourite game franchise) but far cry 2, 3, 4 and Primal had way better stories. this campaign was short, didn't seem to have much of a story ark, and i wasn't invested at all in the story. not enough secondary objectives. I felt like i really got deep into the worlds that 2,3,4 and primal created, playing them for months each. i crapped this game out in a couple of weeks and now dont really feel like i can go back to it and have much fun. I miss the ability of being able to re-do outposts like in 4. The outposts in 5 didn't really feel like they were outposts, i felt like they weren't labelled well enough on the map, they didn't have enough character, and taking them down wasn't much fun either, it wasn't a challenge, it wasn't rewarding, and all we got each time was some guy waving an american flag or something...cheap. i feel like the only exciting part of the game was the first 20 minutes i spent on the first island after you leave the bunker, that was the only part of the world that was well fleshed out. when it comes to setting- i feel like america was just too familiar to most of us. its a boring setting. you dont feel like you can go wild there, even if it is part of one of the most wild parts of the country. it just isn't as fun as africa or the himalaya or desert islands. very disappointed not to have seen any reference at all to native americans (montana has more indians than anywhere else in the US) and it was one of the few interesting parts of going to america for Europeans like me, native languages and culture are a huge part of how america developed as a country and we just dont see any of it?!?! Though half the population seemed to be black, which i also found very distracting and not realistic at all for montana! Montana population stat breakdown- 89% white, 6.3% native americans [which is huge] and 0.3% black [which is nothing]!!!! i think was a politically driven move and the game has suffered for it. very poor idea from the creators. i worked that out in my head and then had a look at the official stats. game developers had years to sort this out! very dissapointing! Now before you say im racist, i think having different ethnicities in games is a really big step forward that games should strive for, but for goodness sake make it realistic, otherwise it just isn't a believable world, and i cant get immersed in it. All in all, worst Far cry ive played so far, wouldn't recommend buying it to people. All that aside, i am a huge fan and am really looking forward to the next one, in the hope that it smashes it out the park with a big fresh idea!",2018-10-25T10:43:27.000Z,1

Inside the building, there‚Äôs a room where one of the scenes take place. Hopefully they don‚Äôt patch this.

I wouldve made the Resistance Points mich more tedious to gain. You can blow through the antagpnists too quickly I think. Im saving the last boss while doing tons of side missions. Side missions shouldve just been a part of gaining max RP. Make people do it all (or almost all, maybe save collectibles) to get to Joseph. I didnt even need to blow up all of the silos and steal the tankers to kill the 3....Oh well, I feel a bit underwhelmed but Im a whiner.

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"The guy who did Bioshock Infinite did this... That game was amazing from a writing standpoint, and it tells you a lot about the direction this game might take.. I just hope they ask good questions here. Jesus has nothing to do with forcing religion through violence. This could actually be a really good thing for Christians if it treats the religion with fairness instead of putting all religious people in one box. Pastor Jerome is one of the heroes which should tell you a lot. If they make him true to the faith - A non-violent character or someone who wouldn't carry a gun - I think that would actually be way more powerful or interesting from a narrative standpoint and a gaming standpoint. So many religious people getting upset about this game- I think it could actually be a really positive thing for Christians if the story is well told and shows a clear difference between extremism and genuine faith. Especially some of the elements of extremist religion that are so closely tied to extreme nationalism. Nationalism is an idolatry that infects religion and turns it poisonous. People think religion is the problem. It isn't. It is extreme nationalism that wears the mask of religion. God is on my country's side.... No. God is on the side of human beings period. Men women and children of all colors, creeds and countries. The Jew and the Gentile... The slave and the free....Would love to a see a game point out those more nuanced realities.",2017-06-18T05:52:08.000Z,0

I can't tell if they're autistic forty year old men or fifteen year old teenagers who have no knowledge of the wider world. What annoys me quite a bit is that for some reason people are mad because there is a crazy Christian cult or whatever. Now as an agnostic I can give a clear view on this situation. First off, Ubisoft chose this to be a Christianish cult as a design choice, not to create controversy. Ubisoft are not dumb. There are so many shooters coming out at the moment where the main enemy is Isis like terrorists. Ubisoft thought to themselves maybe we should TRY AND BE ORIGINAL, so that is what they did. And for the record, Christianity doesn't exactly have a spotless record when it comes to religious persecution. This comment was pretty badly worded, I know, but what I'm trying to say is that this is a fresh idea for a game, and if you don't like not being able to kill al queda then go back to csgo",2017-06-08T13:40:13.000Z,0

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"from an artistic standpoint: i think that this kinda needed to happen. farcry as a series has always been about losing your mind in the jungle. now we have a game that does that, pokes fun at right wing gun nuts AND pisses off the liberals by showing how violent we all can be in a frick'n video game, which everyone likes to poke in general. with gta going back and forth between being mafia and gta classic, and saints row having already turned itself inside out in the name of comedy... i thing farcry 5 might get major publicity... i can see it now ""we see farcry 5 as a homeland terrer simulator"" me: ""wow, have you even played/watched/read ANYTHING about farcry in 8 years? sure, cave man fights, and pirate slavers, and slaughtering african insergeants, but the minute we have violence in small town america, suddenly its too far... seriously, you could change the mountains into a California backdrop and make this a game about fighting Charles Manson.""   *sigh* -_-",2017-06-01T21:04:59.000Z,0

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"While the idea of the villains being American religious extremists isn't a bad idea, TV shows have used that idea for years so it's nothing new. The idea that they are as threatening as the kind of foes faced in previous far cry games is a bit sketchy, third world warlords, drug cartels, those can create the kind of lawless free for all environment Far Cry games are known for. Assuming the game takes place in the modern era, the U.S. Strikes me as a place that would be a little hard to do, I just don't see the protagonist having to wage a one man war against the villains when their actions (assault, murder, etc.) would become public pretty quickly and would likely end with the army on their doorstep. Waco Texas is a good example of how quickly something like that would not only be dealt with, but contained to a single place and not an entire region, the Jamestown cult on the other hand set up shop on foreign soil so that was not as simple to deal with. Granted this is just a trailer and the game may explain how a region within U.S borders can turn into the village from RE4 without the parasites.",2017-06-01T20:31:12.000Z,0

They basically all boil down to ""Ubisoft is making this game to push a liberal agenda that it's ok to kill conservatives and Christians"".

I have never read something so absolutely retarded.

If that's honestly your argument, you are a fucking moron of epic proportions. Because that implies that ALL the other Far Cry games were made by Ubisoft to show that killing islanders, natives, etc is okay.

It's a massive stereotyping of things like the Branch Davidians and militia/preppers that probably care more about gun control laws than Baby Jesus. Same way Wildlands was a mass stereotyping of cartels. That game had the word ""sicario"" in its dialog about a million times and would have had it in the dialog zero times if the movie never got made. It drew 99% of its ""inspiration"" from pop culture like Sicario, Narcos, and Breaking Bad.

I, for one, am at least glad Ubisoft is taking yet another risk. Because Primal was a HUGE risk and paid off. The game wasn't going to win any awards, but it was a pleasant change of pace from the ""bigger and better"" route that tends to cripple a franchise if they stick with it too long and end up not knowing where to take it. Probably why EA took Battlefield back to WWI, and Activision responded by taking COD back to WWII. And even Assassins Creed seems to be doing the same from what little I've read about the new one.

I just hope the game isn't over-laden with ""bible stuff."" Because that kinda killed Outlast 2 for me. Seemed like it intentionally perverted peoples' religion as a crutch for the story.",2017-05-28T02:27:29.000Z,0

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"So I found some things that are some nice little Easter eggs.
Shirtless dude with scars = John the Baptist as he baptized the people and spreads the "" good news

On the church they put on ""John 1:1
Wich were the words ""in the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word was god"" wich then switched to the antagonist who is saying the "" word "". This reveals that he sees himself as Jesus.

The main city is in the game is ""falls end""

The symbol is a mixture of Jesus cross and peters cross ( peter was crusified side ways) most likely to represent the sacrifice of all of the members not just the leader.

In the beginning of the trailer it says ""can't you?"", but according to grammar
It should be ""cant you"" with no apostrophe

All of the 7 deadly sins are spread throughout the trailer
Ex gluttony 1:09
Greed 1:16
Wrath 1:19
Murder 1:34

The main antagonist wears rosaries on his hand

I see the Father every day of my life. I see him when I thank Him for my meals and before I go to bed at night. I see Him when we break the bread and drink the wine on Sunday. I see Him in the eyes of every newborn baby. I see Him when I hear a happy pair say ""I do"". I see Him during every Baptism and every Advent and all the 40 days and nights of Lent. I see Him every 25th morning of December with my beloved company as we sit and open every gift. I see Him every Memorial when a fellow man is laid to their finally rest and joins Him in eternal peace. I see Him when I have failed and have needed His guidance. I see Him in the skies during twilight hours and in the trees and the oceans and in all His creations as the run and fly and travel the Earth. 
I have seen the Father... and I assure you preacher of Hope County, Montana....

in america, about 80 percent of the population Is christian, so, in essence, it would make sense that a extreme religious cult could relatively invade a rural county/town with influences from the Christian faith. much like pagan min royal army takes homage to faiths mixing Chinese and north indian. 

so when you take that into account, you can't really say for certainty that Ubisoft is trying to denigrate Christian white people, nor are they attempting to stereotype them to appease a leftist ahenda. granted, they COULD, judging from their inclusion of a female protagonist, and transgender character in assy creed syndicate In an attempt to appease some feminists who wouldn't have played the game to begin with, but I'd rather wait and see what else is in store for this game. my concern is that the far cry series has gone far beyond its ability to flesh out the mechanics from far cry 3 and Is just retreading the same mechanics with slightly more guns and vehicles from before. the fact that there are separate editions well before the game is out doesn't bode confidence in me that it intends to push the envelope",2017-05-27T16:16:21.000Z,0

In the end, it's all about power and money. Every time a game developer does something controversial, they do it on purpose for the sake of marketing. It's just this time it pertains to white American Christians instead of some generic forgettable ""exotic"" brown people which gamers have no problem mindlessly slaughtering. If Ubisoft made a game about killing left wing people, we'd be reading comments of snowflakes dissing the game and right wingers praising it. So my point is, stop getting offended and look at things more objectively rather than see everything as a personal attack on whatever group you're part of. Controversy is exactly what Ubisoft wants from it's fans. Don't be manipulated by their ways. Ubisoft is a corporation just like the rest and only cares about money.

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"Something tells me this is not going to go over well with Montanans. The setting is perfect for Far Cry.  But Ubisoft is risking being taken to coart for misrepresentation. 

The whole religious cult thing is kind of pushing the envelope a bit. In any other state but Montana that might fly. But Montana is already hypersensitive to things which affect it's bottom line. 

I know this because I have friends that live in Bozeman. Which are afraid how the whole Greg Genforte assault is going to affect tourism there. Warrented or not it's a legitimate concern for a state. 

Where tourism accounts for nearly half of it's revenue. So depending on how the story plays out here. It could run into problems but there are some other aspects which don't fit either. 

A dogfight in Montana is unlikely because you have Malstrom Air Force Base. Which oversees one of the largest IBCM missile bases in the country lol. Any dog fight would  be short-lived.  Still could be good though but I'm skeptical.",2017-05-27T07:06:48.000Z,0

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"I love the Far Cry series so far. Looking at how the game has been and what its become is certainly crazy but in my opinion I think it keeps improving. It went from this realistic FPS survival shooter to this fast pace action game. I love both these themes in Far Cry and I'm extremely excited to see what Far Cry 5 will have to offer, but I'm absolutely curious on how you will combine what seems like a more urban theme to the game with a survival element which is featured in practically every game in the series. I noticed if you get the special or ultimate edition there are items that come with it. I noticed one of the item packs you can get is called the Doomsday Prepper Pack. When I look at this then I think more of a ""Everything is abandoned and society is collapsing"" feel. Will the survival aspect of the game be about scavenging the civilized areas of the open world instead of facing the brutal wilderness, or is this name just referring to the setting of  the story where a group of extremists are causing anarchy in this small Montana town because a preacher is spreading information to others on how the world is going to end because everyone is unholy?",2017-05-27T04:26:38.000Z,0

Seen this a lot lately. including Outlast 2, Tv shows etc.
Are Developers and publishers afraid to show other religions as dangerous? Do they take the easy route out because there will be no backlash when showing christians being evil?

Pretty far from the reality if you ask me",2017-05-27T02:47:34.000Z,0

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"A lot of people seem to say ""It's about time America is the antagonist in a video game"" and then hate on people who are pissed about it, when the reason some people are pissed is because they are actually targeting ""America"" specifically, when in past Far Cry games, it was fictional places that resembled real regions. And to those people who are saying ""It's not christians, it's a cult"", the actually promotional art was a reference to the last supper. I'm in no way religious. I think the idea of a ""God"" is silly. But it's clear that video games lately have a liberal agenda to push the idea of antagonistic white America. You're not empowering minorities. You're just flipping the same coin onto it's other side. Same with the growing number of ""Strong female leads"". It's fine to have them, but when two Star Wars movies and a Star Wars game release with ""Strong female leads"" consecutively, the agenda becomes apparent. Video games are falling into the same pit that Hollywood fell into. Diversity is great! But when you cry ""islamophobia is bad, bring on political correctness"" and then cheer when a game is about gunning down right-wing christians, that's when a reality check is in order. Leave politics out of games. That goes for both Left and Right wing.

Not opposed to this setting at all, hell i thought if it had more thought put into it, Bioshock Infinite would've had an incredible take on Nationalist Extremism. 

But this looks somewhat generic to me. Like Far Cry took their usual setting of crazy baddies, wild animals, and beautiful backdrops and just applied the american extremism filter to it. What are they going to do to make this experience stand out. What makes this villain different from every other cult leader ""prophet""? Ubisoft has the ability to tell good stories when they put effort into it. It's why Far Cry 3 and Vaas still stand up phenomenally well.

But if Far Cry is going to base their games now around ""memorable, horrific villains."" they have to make this one stand out more. This guy sounds very generic and almost deadpan in his delivery and his design isn't that visually interesting. Not trying to be overly critical or demand they change the game because as a white guy suddenly I'm offended with the portrayal this game brings.

You are the ones who give the more open-minded of us and Christianity as a whole a bad name. It's no secret that our religion has spawned some pretty twisted cults, past and present, but most people know that not all Christians are fanatic cultists. There may be some of the more simple minded out there who play this and take is as a perfect representation of all of Christianity, but I promise you, this game will not destroy our religion over night. It's just a game. Besides, I think that a story about fighting a cult and not, you know, regular everyday Christians going about their business might not be the anti-religious agenda you seem to think it is. Let's be better than this, please.

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"Guys.... I'm a Christian and this is clearly not a narrative on Christianity. These are cultists, the preacher in the video is professing to be God and they are worshipping him. Let's cool it with all the backlash towards Islam and Christianity. 

In fairness most if you  you are probably right, if this was based on Islam there would be lots of controversy, just as there is with this form of the game. 

Nonetheless, we have to remember that regardless of the religion or even lackthereof, there are always radicals. Jihadists in Islam who misinterpret the true meaning of Jihad as a spiritual rather than physical war. Christian crusaders who swept through Europe with a poor interpretation of the Gospel message. Stalin persecuting Christians, or Atheist nations like North Korea who persecute people of any religion in record numbers, seeing them as ignorant. 

The Holocaust, Armenian Genocide, countless other tragic events where lives were lost. Let's not let these be the poster boys of our world. The larger percentages of Atheists, Christians, and Muslims simply are all striving for the same things; understanding, meaning, and unity. We all choose different paths that we think will lead us to God or meaning, but ultimately we're hypocritical when we slander each other based on our perception of someone else's path. Just because we aren't physically violent towards someone because of their religion doesn't mean we aren't causing conflict and spreading hatred, and in that regard we're no better than those Jihadists or Crusaders or Nazis.",2017-05-26T17:51:30.000Z,0

As a christian this makes me angry, this game should be removed from the shelves it is blasphemy.  There's no Christian militia acting like this in America and there never will be. At the end of the day religion and Video games should be kept separate, I don't advocate a game demonising Islam either or any religion for that matter apart from 'idolizing doctrines' such thinking here is bad and should be looked down upon. 
Whatever people say about Islam they do also worship Jesus or Isa as he is called in the Quran and for that reason one who is religious cannot hate Islam, they pray to our same Abrahamic God; I don't want to hear arguments otherwise. Islam and Christianity can work in unison as evidenced by the peace-loving, incredible individuals of the baha'i faith. 
ISIS, Al Qaeda, The Lord's Resistance army, Los Zetas, Knights Templars...  they are nothing but thugs, angry individuals who just want to kill and they would do it for whatever reason, the only reason these groups exist is because there are: angry, deprived and desperate peoples full of anger and hatred; they kill in the name of God in the false hope they give their pathetic, worthless lives purpose. It's easy to stereotype and hate but much harder to love and forgive.

 Props to Ro B

""So despite every previous FarCry game having us kill copious amounts of brown people and thats ""just fine"", as soon as the bad guys are white its ""librul white genocide reeeeEEEE!"" Why not have Ghost Recon: Wildlands set in the rural south instead of Bolivia? Why are there no games about Vietnam where we play as the north and slaughter American soldiers?"" 

You people have to be fucking kidding me. Far Cry 2 literally took place in AFRICA for crying our loud! Yet you're still whining about the setting of the game, claiming it is pandering to minorities. What the hell kind of half-assed logic is that? You are literally worst than the SJWs themselves, no one mentioned ANYTHING about race. I went into this video thinking ""Hm, reminds me a lot of the recent Outlast 2. I think it's interesting that the series will turn to rural America for it's next exotic location."" Only to find people bitching in the comments about ""Leftist propaganda"" this and ""Pandering to minorities who don't even play video games"" that.

It's moments like this that make it really, really difficult for me to stomach other people. I've seen this everywhere for that matter. What am I to you exactly? Some sort of brainless animal that both the right and left to guide? You people ironically treat minorities like they are some kind of foreign entity that needs to be tamed. Like seriously, think about it. I, an African-American view myself as normal, and equal to everyone else. I am a 17-year-old boy in high school who works, plays video games for fun and etc. I don't take my race into consideration when dealing with politics and popular culture. I am constantly lectured by right-wingers that I SHOULD not take my race into consideration when dealing with politics and popular culture. Yet, every single fucking time they suspect racial prejudice against their race the same bastards are arguing about how it is unfair and racist towards themselves, seems to me like you're the true special snow flakes.

2017-05-26T13:00:02.000Z,Kdaoe4hbMso,Far Cry 5: Official Announce Trailer | Ubisoft [NA],"Dear Ubisoft, 
I have to say, this game looks like it could be PHENOMENAL if it is done right! I love the setting, the aesthetics,  and the character development happening in the other videos looking at the resistance members. My personal hope for the game is that I actually hope you guys aren't afraid to make it kind of wacky/campy lol! Farcry (for me) has always been a wild and exciting ride and it doesn't need to be ultra serious all the time...you can make it Blood Dragon funny at times (or even all the time for that matter). Also, it would be fun to see more exciting perks for 5 as well, try to make them more exciting and really give us that reason to have that need to level up. This is very subjective too but I hope you can listen to a lot of country while your driving, definitely need some bluegrass too for good chases aka Dukes of Hazard lol! I am now really excited about this and I can't wait to see some of that game play!!!!!!",2017-05-26T13:42:23.000Z,0
