Will I still play it? Yes.I think it looks pretty cool, theres now an actual use to pokemon go that we can use. Plus all the perks this game will bring us. The dual player idea is amazing and I'm definately playing with two people when I have it because it'd be more fun to have a adventure with a real life rival of some sort that you fight beside sorta like in Ruby/Saphire/ORAS where Ethan helped you fight team Magma/Aqua constantly but was always a rival in a way. Eevee is one of my favorites and i'm very happy to see Eevee get its own game basically. Also we need to be happy they brought back pokemon companions! Both in game and out of it! Havent seen that since Soul Silver and Heart Gold. Speaking of SSHG, The PokeWalker is back! It adds a sense of realism to the game and having the pokewalker when I played SSHG made the game come alive to me back then. But, the¬†battling in the game will be sketchy but still cool and fun to play. ALSO, ITS THE KANTO REGION. This means you can catch Mew then Mewtwo. Jumping back to SSHG, Hoenn is connected to Kanto basically so maybe as a litte twist when you beat the game and catch Mewtwo and beat the elete four, you can travel to Hoenn and play through it again.Overall, The game shouldn't be getting hate and it will be a super fun game to play.",2018-06-04T07:14:06.000Z,0

Well, this honestly made me want to write out a lengthy comment on what I think. I definitely don't like the idea, but there are certain aspects and features which I favor over others.

*Pro* : The multiplayer is something that I have been wanting for a long time (I don't know about the rest of you guys), and I am certainly excited for that, and am waiting anxiously for the idea to be implemented into a core Pokemon Game.

*Con* : Right off the bat, I will come out and say that I don't agree with not just the gameplay to reflect that of Pokemon GO, but I especially don't like the fact that Pokemon GO could be used alongside it, and that Pokemon GO was the main inspiration of these games. I don't just not like it, in fact I HATE it, even all the way up to the TITLES of the games.

*Con* : Pikachu and Eevee. The Pokemon Company is trying to not just appeal to hardcore fans, but to the measly surface fans as well (even though the only people still playing Pokemon GO, the game that these were inspired by, are probably the hardcore fans). This is not good. I understand that ""Oh, Pikachu is the mascot of the franchise"" I DON'T CARE. And I also understand that, from a business standpoint, this could benefit them, as they may be trying to attract these ""surface fans"". Other than those, I keep my reasoning to myself here.

*Pro* : The graphics and art style used are a big leap from Sun and Moon, and from U-Sun and U-Moon (for the better). I love the way the characters look, and I also love how the lighting and shadows play. It's pretty cool, and again, definitely a step up from Gen 7A (SM) and 7B (USUM) on the 3DS.

*Con* : However, on the contrary, the characters look VERY childish. And while I understand the reason for this, I don't like it. It looks bad...

*Pro* : The fact that you can run into a Pokemon of your choice (that's in the vicinity, that is) like Pokemon GO is something that I have been wanting. I would love to see this in a core Pokemon game (alongside the Multiplayer, please)

*Pro* : Walking with your Pokemon RETURNS!!!! FINALLY

*Con* : Just have the game come out, with no ""Special Pokemon"" or anything, I know it's a good luring business tactic, but this makes me want to buy the game even less... (Besides, it'll probably be crap...)

*Con* : Don't tell me that I just hate Gen 1, but Kanto? AGAIN? This is the 5th time that the game has taken place in Kanto. Just make a new region already.

*Pro* : Traditional Pokemon Battles in a Pokemon GO inspired game. FINALLY! The exclusion of this was one reason I hated Pokemon GO.

That is really all I have to say. If you are concerned with anything above, feel free to reply to this comment! Thank you",2018-06-03T17:12:53.000Z,0

The game looks stunning graphics wise.  Battle system is still in, only for trainer battles. If its kanto true and true, youll have a vs seeker to grind levels if need be. Pokemon are in the overworld so you can actually seek out pokemon. Pokemon follow you again. Pokemon go isnt necessary, just adds a bonus. You dont want kanto again, but expect them to lead with a new console with a sinnoh remake or unova (dont know how people got there). Upset that the catching is different, but how else would the switch impact pokemon gameplay. You want to just hold a controller and play it exactly the same? Why even throw it on to the swicth then. Every game on the switch has integrated the joy cons in some way, this seems like the most logical way for a pokemon game to do it.  Ive played since day one and this looks bomb, nostalgia aside.

You've ALWAYS had to weaken a Pokemon before catching it. Even in the anime you had to do that. I don't know why they changed that in this game. I guess they're trying to milk that Pokemon Go gameplay.

Stop acting like more recent games haven't been all the way hand-holding and condescending to the player. All of the sins this game may commit were already committed by all of the the previous releases, the rest is just innovation which isn't bad since every Pokemon game we had before was basically the same thing but ""different"".

This game is getting 8-9/10 scores, has improved music/audio, a Pokemon adventure I can take anywhere and on to the TV. Yet still these elitists aren't pleased.

This in addition to many other features such as catching takes skill, improved graphics, partner Pokemon, catching combos for better IV, old school touch, easy to get into, lots to explore, friends to trade Pokemon with, improved character customization, Pokemon following you, riding Pokemon, no random dumb chance encounters, easier to find the Pokemon you want, connects with the GO app, real GYM battles, real old school legendaries you actually care about to catch, online battles and becoming a master magikarp trainer.

Game Freak had to remove some old features (hold items+abilities) in order to appeal to a new audience. And it isn't a big deal for most of us, the elitists are making a bird out of a feather here. Bottom line the pro reviewers are giving this game an amazing score and you're a Pokemon fan. Be happy and get this game because it is awesome!",2018-11-16T16:13:40.000Z,0

I personally don't like the ""pokemon go"" style encounters, because it just doesnt seem satisfying, or fun anymore to catch pokemon. With the classic style encounter, it felt satisfying to catch pokemon because you had to really work towards it by weakening it, it felt more like you were actually catching these creatures. Whereas in Let's go, you kind of just chuck a pokeball at it and hope for the best. I would have at least like the option for the old battle style. I also wouldn't have minded if the ""pokemon go"" style catching was used in conjunction with the old battle style (eg, you select a pokeball after weakening it and you throw the pokeball like in the ""pokemon go"" style). If it weren't for this, I would absolutely buy the game.",2018-11-16T14:48:04.000Z,2
