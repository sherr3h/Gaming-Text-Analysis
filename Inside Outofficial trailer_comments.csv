2014-12-11T14:00:53.000Z,yRUAzGQ3nSY,Inside Out - Official US Trailer,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are so many problems and so many things that are incredibally annoying.
- Joy is awful and the worst main character I've ever seen in any movie.
- They used as much good Pixar movies as possible in the teaser trailer to make us believe it's going to be like those but instead we get the worst Pixar movie EVER!
- The music is horrible and for babies.
- The bright colors hurt my eyes.
- Riley has NO personallity in this movie.
- Every character isn't even consistant.
- They used a great actor from The Office for the most borring character in the movie.
- It's filled with plot holes and confusion aspects. For an example: Why is Riley the only one with emotions that don't look like her? It's not like the she's special or something, she's unbelievebally minor. Her father's emotions wear a suit and have a mustage, Jordan's emotions have curly hair and skateboards, why do Riley's emotions look different.
- Every emotions is poorly designed and hairy.
- Bing Bong is the most useless character, he has NO purpose in the movie.
- Every 10 minutes, the same thing happens to Joy and Sadness. They find another island and it breaks down before they get there.
- EVERYTHING ABOUT IT",2019-03-13T15:25:22.000Z,0

2014-12-11T14:00:53.000Z,yRUAzGQ3nSY,Inside Out - Official US Trailer,"Riley's Parents (from inside out) both have brown eyes and brown hair. For Riley to have blonde hair and blue eyes her parents would both have to carry recessive genes and both pass on only those recessive genes. The likeliness of this happening is very slim (6.25% chance). Also when the movie starts we see Riley's mom holding baby Riley. Her parents appear to be standing up (and her mother looks nothing like a woman who just gave birth) as if Riley has just been handed to them by a nurse. This is obviously Riley's first encounter with her parents. Also Riley's mother is wearing a pink v-neck t-shirt and not a hospital gown. Because of theses reasons Riley's mother is probably not the woman who just gave birth to her. So, who is? Riley's name is Riley Andersen. Bonnie's last name (from toy story 3) is also Anderson (there could have been a family dispute about the spelling of the name which is why they spell it slightly differently). Andy was a little irresponsible in collage. Him and his girlfriend weren't as careful as they should have been and Andy's girlfriend gets pregnant. Andy and his girlfriend then decided to give their unborn child (Riley) up for adoption. While Andy and his pregnant girlfriend were looking for a nice couple, Andy discussed the issue with Bonnie's mom (because the families seemed to be rather close). Bonnie's mom then recommended her younger brother in law and his wife as potential adoption candidates (Riley's parents as seen in inside out, who look a lot like Bonnie's family). This wife was unable to have children and would be more than happy to adopt andy's baby. This would explain Riley's resemblance to andy's mom and Molly and her adopted parents resemblance to Bonnie's family. It also has been confirmed that andy's house, Bonnie's house, and sunny side are all located in an unnamed tri-county area in CA. Although it's obvious that Riley's family moved to San Francisco for her fathers job, her parents also could have moved there to be closer to family (Bonnie's family). In one memory Riley is seen playing on the playground at sunny side (the only difference is the slide but the playground could have just gotten a new slide). So she obvioudly visited California when she was younger and Bonnie's mom (her aunt) could have brought her to sunny side for a day. Another reason why we know that Riley is in the same area as the toy story movies is (this one is a bit of a stretch) at Riley's school a blue eyed brunett is seen where a scull shirt similar to Sid's (who grew up near Andy and became a garbage man for that area). This could be Sid's daughter or niece. Also, in Up Ellie is told she can't have kids. This could be genetic. Ellie could be mrs Anderson's (Riley's mom) aunt. Ellie would therefore be related to Bonnie's family through marriage so Bonnie's mother and Ellie could very well know each other. This would explain how Andy also knows Carl and Ellie and why he has a post card addressed to them.",2016-05-03T02:17:46.000Z,26

2014-12-11T14:00:53.000Z,yRUAzGQ3nSY,Inside Out - Official US Trailer,"Anyone notice how the main emotions in the parents were Sadness and Anger in the mom and dad? But they were both mature and controlled as well as having their own stations and working together actively? And that in the dad, the right hand man to his anger was fear and for the mom, all the emotions got more equal time. But in the kid, everyone kinda fought/randomly took over and Joy was the main one in control?
I like it.
Very sneaky Pixar/Disney, and pretty brilliant.
This move hit me in all of my feels. I rarely cry at movies, but this was a brilliant film.",2015-07-29T21:40:48.000Z,0

2014-12-11T14:00:53.000Z,yRUAzGQ3nSY,Inside Out - Official US Trailer,The emotion in the center of the table seems to be the default state that the character is in. The mom's is sadness (probably because she is thinking about her daughter's first day of school) while the dad's is anger which is probably due to him thinking about his current life situation all the time (or in the clip they showed him thinking about hockey). The daughter's central emotion was hard to see but I believe it was anger as well. I guess it will make more sense when the movie comes out.,2015-06-19T16:31:52.000Z,0

Alright, so..notice how in the parent's brains their emotions are all agreeing with one another, and conforming under one leader? While, inside Riley's mind, everything is bonkers for control, and who gets to do what? I think this whole movie is about how Disgust and Anger think they have the most control in this mind, and Joy and the others don't seem to like it. While Riley is battling the real-world, the emotions in her head battle for dominance as Riley's main emotion, the one she usually turns to. Maybe they all have their own unique way they think Riley should grow up, like Anger thinks Riley should be mean and nasty, but assertive to get what she wants, while Fear thinks she should be sheltered and afraid to step out of her comfort zone. I really do think this movie is going to revolve around some sort of power struggle, and either Anger or Disgust is going to be the antagonist; but not exactly doing bad things, just trying to live life the way they think could protect the girl they live inside of.

Just thinking is all..this movie has great possibilities, and I am sooo excited for it!",2015-02-04T20:11:32.000Z,7

Also keep in mind how for the dad, when anger says ""I don't wanna have to put the foot down,"" Fear stars trembling in fear.  However, after anger commands everyone to ""put the foot down,"" fear and everyone else stats cheering for the ""foot"".

This is an obvious sign that fear and sadness controls this obviously dysfunctional family.

Most likely, the movie will tell the tale of this family's journey into love and compassion rather than fear and sadness.  No spoilers intended, but I wouldn't be surprised if Joy eventually takes head chair by the end of the movie for the whole family.",2014-12-24T00:13:00.000Z,28

2014-12-11T14:00:53.000Z,yRUAzGQ3nSY,Inside Out - Official US Trailer,"I think it's very interesting how the environments these emotions are in all look different. Riley's mind has it's own and somewhat indescribable background to it as she is still trying to figure things out while the backgrounds of her parents' minds help to define the interactions between the emotions. I love how the dad's mind is like Houston  bringing the astronauts home with a leader to whom everyone looks to in order to make a decision.  When he's got time off from dealing with a fight or flight situation, his emotions can hang out and have fun, but as soon as there's a problem, it turns into a bigger situation than it really is. Much like many type A people (myself included) we want things to be as simple as possible. So maybe in the mind of a type A person, trying to solve a confrontation would be like Houston trying to save the astronauts from hitting an asteroid.  In contrast, a type B personality (like the mother) is usually more free flowing and willing to adapt to a new situation. The mother's psychological landscape reminds me of a set of a talk show. Look at the curtain in the back and the desk, and those comfy looking chairs. The emotions all have obvious differences in personality and opinion much like the women on The View or The Talk. Even though Sadness has the head chair in the mother's head, her other emotions feel free to say how they feel about a problem and what they would do to solve it. Her inner monologue with her emotions really shines through as we see someone who is just as receptive to other people as well as her other, non-primary emotions.",2014-12-16T07:37:10.000Z,0

I think it's so cool how they show the differences between how children and adults manage their emotions. As you get older, it can get easier to manage your emotions because you'll be more in tune with yourself and just what you're feeling. Dealing with things in a calm, rational manner is something that can unify differing emotions. That's why they look the same in the mom and dad's heads, but not the girl's. In adolescents, like Riley, there's more of a divide between differing emotions. Also, in this movie, I really like that they show that people can sometimes be primarily motivated by a certain emotion. The dad responds with anger while the mom responds with sympathy. It's not that they only feel sadness or anger, it's just that everybody has a certain emotion that can trigger a more effective response in a ""fight or flight"" situation.",2014-12-12T08:51:50.000Z,2

If she remains to have a mixture, does that mean she'll be bisexual? :) .

Also, do the little people/creatures in the character's heads, have little people/creatures in their heads and if they do, those even smaller people/creatures have EVEN smaller people/creatures in their heads etc, continuing on to infinite? :) .

1. From what we can see of the mom's ""memories"" (those colored orbs in the background), she seems to have a pretty calm demeanor. I don't see a single red orb back there.
2. This is actually quite perfect because the emotions in the parents' minds are a well-oiled machine. They're generally on the same level with each other and everything's in control. In Riley's growing mind, however, her emotions seem to be having a hard time getting along and maintaining peace and understanding each other.

Pixar, this is why I love you again and again. :D",2014-12-11T17:42:52.000Z,83
